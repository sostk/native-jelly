# Cross-compile the FFmpeg the app SHIPS, for 32-bit ARM, with the webOS NDK.
#
# WHY WE BUNDLE. The app used to demux with the television's own FFmpeg, which meant reading its
# structs at byte offsets we could not check: LG ships no headers, the binaries are stripped, and
# the major moves with the firmware (55 -> 57 -> 58 -> 59 -> 60 across webOS 2 to 11). That was
# survivable while the offsets could be re-derived against upstream headers at the matching
# version — but only for the LAYOUT half of the problem. The other half is not checkable at all:
# demuxers, bitstream filters, encoders and muxers live in a REGISTRY, as data, not as exported
# symbols. No symbol table and no firmware database can answer "does this set's libavcodec have
# h264_mp4toannexb", and the author has no hardware past webOS 4.5 to ask. Bundling turns both
# halves into compile-time facts.
#
# It also collapses the maintenance: one FFmpeg on every television, so adding a webOS release
# costs nothing and the demuxer stops being a variable in every bug report.
#
# THIS IS ALSO WEBOSBREW'S PUBLISHED GUIDANCE, which is worth knowing before anyone re-opens the
# decision. https://www.webosbrew.org/develop/caniuse/?q=ffmpeg carries a warning rather than a
# compatibility table: "Don't use system FFmpeg libraries! They will cause linkage issues and
# doesn't come with usable video codecs either." Both halves are the reasoning above — the SONAME
# drift, and the component list that cannot be inspected from outside.
#
# LICENCE. Built SHARED, deliberately. FFmpeg here is LGPL-2.1 (no --enable-gpl, no --enable-
# nonfree), and shipping it as separate .so files keeps us in §6(b) — the user can replace the
# library — exactly as dynamic linking against the TV's copy did. Static linking would pull in
# §6(a)'s relinkable-object obligation for no benefit. The source tarball this builds from is
# published beside each release; see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.
#
# BUILD SUFFIX. The libraries are named libavformat-plx.so.60 and so on. webOS 11.2.0 ships
# FFmpeg 6 too, so without the suffix our file names and SONAMEs would collide with the
# television's own — and "which libavformat did we actually get" is precisely the question that
# cannot be answered remotely. With it, the answer is structural.
#
# NO RPATH, DELIBERATELY. The obvious way to make our libavformat find our libavcodec is
# -Wl,-rpath,$ORIGIN, and it does not survive: FFmpeg's configure evals its flags, so `$$ORIGIN`
# becomes the shell's PID and `\$$ORIGIN` becomes nothing. Both produce a library that silently
# loads a DIFFERENT libavcodec. Instead ff.rs dlopens the four in dependency order with
# RTLD_GLOBAL — libavutil, then libavcodec, then libavformat — so each is already in the global
# scope by SONAME when the next one names it. That is ordinary loader behaviour, it needs no build
# flag to survive quoting, and unlike an rpath it can be asserted from inside the app.
#
# HOST=1 BUILDS THE SAME FFMPEG FOR THIS MAC INSTEAD, and it is the same script on purpose.
#
# The desktop simulator (`make sim`) runs the real app core on macOS, but `ff.rs` dlopens the
# bundled libraries by absolute path out of the app directory — where they are 32-bit ARM ELF. So
# the ENTIRE streaming half of the app (the AVIO transports, the HLS demux, the AU queues and
# therefore the whole adaptive controller) was device-only, and the one instrument that can run
# them without a television could not reach them: `ff: FFmpeg unavailable — the app runs, playback
# will refuse`, measured 2026-08-28.
#
# **One script, and specifically ONE COMPONENT LIST.** Everything below `set --` is shared: same
# version, same demuxers, parsers, bitstream filters and decoders, same `--disable-network` with
# `file` as the only protocol, same `-plx` suffix, same LGPL flags. A second script would drift,
# and the drift would be invisible — the host would demux something the television cannot, or
# stop demuxing something it can, and the simulator would be answering about a different FFmpeg
# while looking identical. The cross block is the only difference, and it is three lines.
#
# The output is `vendor/ffmpeg-prefix-host` and `libavformat-plx.63.dylib` — Mach-O naming, so
# nothing here can be confused with the shipped ELF even by basename, and `make ipk`'s
# `lib*-plx.so.*` glob cannot pick it up.

# WHERE EACH HALF LIVES, and why they are no longer in the same place.
#
# The PREFIX — the 3.8 MB of installed libraries and headers — stays inside the checkout, exactly
# where it was. `make`'s staleness sentinel is a header inside it, the configuration stamp deletes
# that header to force a rebuild on a RELEASE flip, CI caches the directory by that path and
# `ci/ffabi-assert.c` compiles against its headers. Nothing about the prefix moved.
#
# The WORK tree did. It is the extracted upstream source plus every object file — 122 MB for the
# cross build and 123 MB for the host one, against that 3.8 MB of output — and it is pure means:
# once the prefix exists, nothing ever reads it again. A fleet of parallel worktrees
# (`.agents/skills/fleet-plan`) got ONE OF EACH PER LANE, byte-identical, each compiled from
# scratch. Measured 2026-09-03: twelve lanes held 2.6 GB of them on a volume with 3.2 GiB free,
# and every new lane paid the two-minute compile again to produce bytes that already existed
# eleven times over.
#
# So it lives under $NJ_BUILD_CACHE (default ~/.cache/nativejelly), machine-wide, KEYED BY THE
# CONFIGURE FLAGS. The key is the half that makes sharing safe, and it is precisely what the
# manual `ln -s` workaround in fleet-plan could not express: RELEASE=1 drops swscale and the
# mpeg1/mpegts pair, so a dev lane and a release lane MUST NOT share one build tree. Different
# flags hash to different keys and the two never meet — where the symlink recipe silently handed
# one configuration the other's libraries. The cross and host builds key apart for the same
# reason, as do two different NDKs.
#
# Set NJ_BUILD_CACHE= (empty) to keep the build tree in the checkout as it was; CI does not need
# to, because a runner is ephemeral and caches the prefix rather than the objects.
#
# The TARBALL is deliberately NOT in the cache. It is the LGPL corresponding source that
# `release.yml` publishes beside each release (`ls vendor/ffmpeg-build/ffmpeg-*.tar.xz`), so it
# belongs with the checkout, it is 10 MB, and both the cross and host builds now share the one
# copy instead of downloading it twice.

#
# WHY: FFmpeg records its entire configure INVOCATION inside libavutil (`avutil_configuration()`),
# so every absolute path on that command line ends up in the shipped `.so`. A real `--prefix` put
# the maintainer's working directory in all three libraries, and with it the `.ipk` sha — which
# silently made "builds are reproducible" false in the v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 release notes, on the one
# number a user has to check an unsigned download. `/plx` is a stand-in that exists nowhere.
#
# It does NOT make a local build reproducible, and nothing here can: `--cross-prefix` must be
# absolute (see below — the NDK gcc is a wrapper that dies when invoked through PATH), so the
# configure string still carries wherever the NDK lives. Reproducibility is therefore a property
# of the CI BUILD, whose path is fixed for every GitHub runner — which is the real reason releases
# must be published by the workflow and never by hand. Do not restore a "rebuild and compare"
# claim to the notes without checking `strings` on all three libraries first.
#
# Do NOT "fix" this with -ffile-prefix-map: that flag is itself part of the configure line, so
# passing absolute paths to it ADDS two more leaks than it removes. Tried, measured, reverted.

# The NDK's gcc is a WRAPPER that resolves its own path at startup. Invoked through PATH it dies
# with "toolchain-wrapper.c: readlink: No such file or directory" and configure reports the

#   bsf        AVCC -> Annex-B for mp4-family video, which the Starfish pipeline requires.

# `--disable-autodetect` is NOT redundant beside `--disable-everything`, which governs the
# component registry and says nothing about EXTERNAL libraries. Without it configure goes looking
# through pkg-config and folds in whatever the machine happens to have — on a Mac with Homebrew
# that is real: the host dylibs pick up dependencies of packages this project never asked for. In
# a shared, keyed cache that is worse than untidy, because the key cannot see it: uninstall the
# package later and a fresh checkout still selects the same work tree, decides the objects are
# current, and stages dylibs referencing a library that is no longer on the disk. It also makes
# the two builds agree — the cross build had no such packages to find, so the host one was the
# only half whose output depended on the machine it was built on.
#
# **zlib is the one external library, and it is named, not detected.** `--disable-autodetect`
# took it too, and nothing failed: the matroska demuxer only INFLATES a track's ContentCompression
# when built with zlib, and otherwise logs "Unsupported encoding type" and passes the packets
# through still compressed. mkvmerge compresses every PGS and VobSub track with zlib by default,
# so on nearly every Blu-ray remux the image-subtitle decoder was handed `78 da …`, found no
# display set, and produced nothing — playback perfect, not one `image cue`, on every television
# (`subtitle_image_pgs` in two release audits). `--enable-zlib` is explicit, so configure FAILS if
# the library is absent instead of quietly building the old behaviour. It links the system
# `libz.so.1`, present on every firmware inventory `fwsym` holds (platform releases 1.2.0
