# The statics gate of the UI restructure (spec §0 done-criterion 1, §15.2): `static mut` in a
# screen or engine module is ZERO except for render caches allowlisted BY NAME with a reason, and
# the three main-thread machine globals (`route/decision.rs SESSION`, `player/engine.rs ENGINE`,
# `ui/press.rs S`) are gone. `ui/press.rs S` went in phase 2; the other two go in phase 9.
#
# Two allowlists, both `# count: N` files that `tests/test_harness.py` audits (declared count ==
# entries, every path exists):
#   ci/allow/statics.txt           the PERMANENT list — `path<TAB>NAME: reason`, one entry per
#                                  static, matched by path AND name. A `Rect` static is never a
#                                  render cache (§15.2), so a hit rect cannot be entered here.
#   ci/allow/statics-migration.txt the MIGRATION list — `path<TAB>phase N: reason`, one entry per
#                                  legacy FILE, matched by path alone; it shrinks with each phase
#                                  and is EMPTY at phase 12. A stale entry (a path with no static
#                                  left) fails, so a deletion must also delete its entry.
# Every `static mut` under ui/, appkit/, screens/, person.rs, metadata.rs, metadata/, catalog_fetch.rs, catalog_fetch/ and stores/,
# plus the two named globals, must match one of the two. search/ is scanned with Required 1's
# wider spelling (`^\s*(pub(\(crate\))? )?static `, not just `static mut`) because that module
# holds `recents.rs`'s two `Mutex`-guarded persistence-seam statics (STORE, PENDING) — real
# process-wide state the narrower pattern cannot see. The wider pattern is NOT applied to the
# other gated directories: run tree-wide it also matches every `thread_local! { static … }`
# interior declaration (a different, safe, per-thread idiom used all over ui/ and screens/ for
# render caches and test doubles), which would surface on the order of 80 unrelated hits in one
# gate change. That widening is deliberately out of scope here — see the PR discussion — and
# must not be resolved by mass-allowlisting.
