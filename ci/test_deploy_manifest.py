"""`make deploy` must ship exactly what `make ipk` stages, minus the entries that get their own
handling for a documented reason (the binary + crash handler's `.new`+`mv` dance, the bundled
FFmpeg libraries' own retirement loop, and the LAB session file's ship-or-remove rule).

This runs `make -s print-app-files` / `print-deploy-files` — two query targets that only echo a
Makefile variable, exactly the pattern `docs/agent-reference.md` prescribes instead of `make -p`
for asking the Makefile a question. Neither touches the television or needs `.tv-host`, so it
needs no TV lock and no device.

It exists because the two lists drifted silently before: `deploy` used to scp the binary, the
crash handler, the appinfo and the fonts by name, one line per file, while `ipk` staged whatever
`APP_FILES` said — so `pkg/splash.png`, both icon sizes, `pkg/OFL.txt` and
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` were in every `.ipk` and in NO deployed app directory, and nothing here
noticed for weeks. Now that `deploy`'s plain-file list (`DEPLOY_FILES`) is defined as `APP_FILES`
minus exactly those three carve-outs, this test is really asking "does the Makefile still define
it that way" — which is exactly the kind of drift a future edit could reintroduce by hand.
