    then `+symbols` when SYMBOLS=1, then `+nightly:<date>` when FLAVOR=nightly, then always
    `+tel:<hash>` — so the real stamp for an ordinary dev build is `features:+tel:98c4b7d3`, which
    equals neither of the two literals this was once written against. It matched when it was
    written; the telemetry field was added later, and from that day the answer was None for EVERY
    build this project makes. Nothing failed — the callers print "SKIP — neither shipped
    configuration" and move on — so the dev-trigger gate, the dev-only-library gate and the
    reported-version gate all graded nothing on every CI run. Exactly the defect class DEV_WITNESS
    is commented against, a witness that cannot fail, reached by another route. The release cut
    carries `SYMBOLS=1`, which adds a THIRD field, so repairing the two literals by hand would have
    left the release job ungraded anyway.

    Only the FEATURE half is decoded, and matched WHOLE rather than by substring: the "shots"
    recipe in the Makefile's header is `--no-default-features --features devtriggers`, which a
    substring test would grade as a release build and then fail for carrying exactly the surface it
    asked for. `+tel:`, `+symbols` and `+nightly:` are all optional so a stamp written by an older
    Makefile still decodes, and the feature flags are lazy so they cannot swallow a trailing field.

# ---- the dev-trigger catalog, derived from dev.rs and devtrig.rs themselves ----------------------

# `devtrig::read` are `false`/`None` without `devtriggers`, so the branches behind them vanish), and
# gave `ci/check-package.py` ONE witness of that: `DEV_WITNESS = b"plxnative-noidle"`, a name
# `dev.rs`'s own `DIAG` array carries as a full, literal `"plxnative-noidle"` string. That witness
# proves DIAG-as-a-whole is gated — but it names only one member of it, and every OTHER
# `plxnative-*` name `dev.rs` (or a sibling module) treats as part of the trigger surface could
# still leak into a release binary with nothing here to notice. `dev_trigger_catalog` generalises
# the single witness to the WHOLE vocabulary those two arrays actually declare:
#
#   * `CONTROLLED` — the bare names a controlled/recorded boot may carry (`devtrig.rs`'s own comment:
#     "a full trigger name in the release binary is exactly what `ci/check-package.py` grades as
#     'dev triggers compiled in'").

#     the array itself, so every genuine member is compile-time absent from `--no-default-features`
#     unless something ELSE outside that gate spells the same string (which is exactly the class of
#     leak this project has now shipped twice: `ui/anim.rs`'s log sink and `dev/scenarios.rs`'s
#     disabled-both diagnostic both spelled a DIAG name in code the feature never touched).

    Rust `&str` constants are fat pointers (data + length), not NUL-terminated C strings, so the
    compiler is free to lay adjacent literals back to back with no separator at all — and it does:
    a real ARM release build was observed to contain literally
    `...jsonlplxnative-hwcnt.jsonlloginonboardli...` as one contiguous byte run, no gap anywhere.
    A plain `name.encode() in blob` substring test cannot tell "the bare trigger name
    `plxnative-hwcnt` is compiled in" from "the ALWAYS-legitimate log filename
    `plxnative-hwcnt.jsonl` (allowlisted above) happens to start with those same bytes" — every

    forever, with no source change able to turn the check green. `plxnative-anim` /
    `plxnative-anim.log` is the same trap in the other direction.

    A trailing word-boundary check (reject the match if the next byte looks like an identifier
    character) does NOT work here, because the packing above proves the byte right after a
    legitimate string's own end is whatever unrelated literal happens to sit next — `l` from
    `login`, not a separator — so a boundary check would reject the LEGITIMATE occurrence too.
    The only fact this can lean on is the exact allowlist itself: an occurrence of `name` is
    innocent if, and only if, it is immediately followed by exactly the bytes that would make it
    read as one particular allowlisted longer name (`name` plus that name's own extra suffix,
    e.g. `.jsonl`) — checked by slicing the blob, not by asking what comes after in the abstract.

# `ci/gen-release-audit.py` from the artifact. The standards are the README in each directory; the
# checks below are the half a command can decide, which is where every check in this project lives
# — a checklist is only as good as the person following it, and the release that skipped every gate
# skipped them BECAUSE it was done by hand.

# The split landed 2026-08-29, and on the same day v0.1.0 through v0.5.0 were rewritten to it as a
# deliberate, dated exercise — so there is no historical exemption and every check below applies to
# every note and every audit in the two directories. The gate that used to sit here (a version
# floor, skipping the structural checks for pre-standard notes) is gone rather than left at a value
# nothing can reach: an exemption nobody can trip is one nobody maintains, and the next standard
# change can reintroduce it against the version it actually needs.

# ---- which webOS versions a release document may name ------------------------------------------
#
# THE "webOS 26" GATE. A published note once asserted support for a webOS 26 that does not exist,
# and until 2026-08-29 this was a plain `version in evidence` substring test over the text of
# `fwcompat.py` and `webos5-port.md`. **That test could not catch its own motivating defect**: both
# documents are full of dates, and `"26" in "2026-08-11"` is True. Widening the corpus made it
# worse rather than better — `docs/webos10-lab-report.md` quotes, in order to refute it, somebody
# else's gloss "= webOS 25 and 26", so the corpus contains the exact string being guarded against.
#
# So the evidence is ENUMERATED instead, and a named version is accepted only when it is a
# component-wise prefix of something in it: `webOS 10` passes on 10.2.0, `webOS 4.5` passes as LG's
# marketing number, `webOS 26` and `webOS 25` fail.
#
# This list is a transcription and transcriptions rot in this repo — so the failure message names
# the authority rather than this file. `tools/fwcompat.py` grades against a downloaded inventory
# and prints the releases it holds; when it grows one, that output is what corrects this line.

# description per television language. LG documents exactly two properties in one — "In the
# appinfo.json file for localization, you should fill appDescription and title properties. All
# other properties are kept the same as the top-level appinfo.json file" — and requires UTF-8
# WITHOUT BOM for non-Latin text. Both are gated below, and neither is cosmetic:
#
#   * a THIRD property in one of these files is `pkg/appinfo.json` duplicated. The version would
#     then live in a file `ci/bump-version.py`, `release.yml`'s tag guard and every version
#     assertion in THIS file have never heard of — the failure `ci/flavor.py`'s "PATCH, DO NOT
#     DUPLICATE" exists to prevent, arrived at from the other direction.
#   * a BOM makes the file unparseable to a strict JSON reader while looking identical in every
#     editor and in `git diff`. LG asks for its absence by name, so this is their rule, not ours.
#
# This runs against the TRACKED tree in every invocation, including the one that has no package
# staged — the tracked-only branch below is what `release.yml`'s `prepare` runs before a tag
# exists, and a translation is exactly the kind of thing that gets edited by hand.

#     and one allowed token vouches for the other. v0.2.1's libraries pass that test.
#   * tokenising to fix it, without keeping the leading boundary, makes plex.tv's own

    # on trunk (`0.5.0` published, `0.6.0-dev` in the tree) — or, on a MAINTENANCE LINE (a tracked
    # `RELEASE_LINE` marker at the repo root, see `expected_dev_version`'s doc and
    # `rust-modules/src/release_line.rs`), the next PATCH instead (`0.6.1` published, `0.6.2-dev`
    # in the tree). That exists so a developer build stops impersonating the last release in
    # X-Plex-Version, in the Sentry release and on the diagnostics panel — and it means a version
    # string now has a way to be wrong that no file comparison can see: a package for the stable id
    # whose binary reports a version no release will ever carry, or, once this rule exists, a
    # developer build that silently stopped saying so.
    #
    # Graded from BOTH sides for the reason DEV_WITNESS is: a witness that cannot fail is not a
    # gate, and the string is compiled in from an env var, i.e. from something a build can lose.
    # The suffix cannot be read off appinfo.json (LG takes three integers, so it never gets there),
    # so it is recomputed here — by `expected_dev_version`, the SAME rule `build.rs::emit_version`
    # applies, so this gate and the binary it grades can never quietly diverge on which arithmetic
    # applies to this checkout.
    #
    # MATCHED WITH THE `plxnative@` PREFIX, not as a bare number, and that is the difference
    # between grading `PLX_VERSION` and grading whatever digits happen to be in .rodata: the About
    # page and any release note text carry the version too, so a bare-number search was satisfiable
    # by a page the version mechanism never touched. `telemetry::{crashreport,native,playback}`
    # compose `concat!("plxnative@", env!("PLX_VERSION"))` in every configuration — telemetry is
    # ungated on purpose — so this witnesses the emitted value itself.
    #
    # NIGHTLY IS GRADED SEPARATELY. Its package version (`appinfo["version"]`, already checked
    # against Cargo.toml above) IS the next-minor-or-patch number — recomputing "next" a second
    # time from it would double-bump and grade against a version nobody built. Its REPORTED
    # version instead adds `build.rs`'s `-nightly-<date>` suffix on top of that SAME number, dated
    # by whatever `PLX_NIGHTLY_DATE` the build actually ran with.
    #
    # THE DATE IS GRADED BY VALUE, READ FROM THE STAMP — not guessed from the binary's own bytes by
    # shape. Two earlier versions of this gate tried exactly that: first a trailing `\b`, then
    # `(?![0-9])` in its place, both trying to say "8 digits, then the date is over" from inside
    # the blob alone. Both failed on a real nightly build (0.7.0's first run, then again on
    # 0.7.0-nightly-202609192m4m6m8m10m12m14m1) because `concat!`'s output in `.rodata` is packed
    # back to back with NO separator — the very next packed literal can start with more digits, and
    # there is no regex that can tell "the date's 9th digit" from "the first digit of an unrelated
    # string right after it" from the bytes alone. So the date is no longer inferred from the
    # binary at all: `nightly_stamp_date` reads it from `pkg/.build-config`'s own `+nightly:<date>`
    # field — the Makefile's OWN record of the value it built with, where `+` is a delimiter this
    # project controls rather than one the linker assembled — and the binary is graded the exact
