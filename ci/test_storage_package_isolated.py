"""Fail if building the storage helper compiles the app library.

`nativejelly-storage` is the small LS2 service binary that holds the private store; it shares a few
source files with the platform layer crate (`platform/src/storage_service/*.rs`,
`platform/src/storage/state.rs`) but never links the
app crate. While it was a `[[bin]]` of the `nativejelly-modules` package, cargo nevertheless built
the whole ~423k-line library for it first (a bin of a package depends on that package's lib), so
`make check` paid two extra host library builds and the `pkg/nativejelly-storage` rule paid a third,
ARM one, for a binary that used none of it. The helper is its own workspace package now, and this
holds that line.

It asks cargo for the resolved UNIT GRAPH of BOTH invocations the repo uses for the helper
(`cargo ... --unit-graph`, nightly `-Zunstable-options`) instead of compiling them:
  * `cargo test <bin> --no-run`, what `make check` builds before running the helper's unit tests;
  * `cargo rustc <bin> --no-default-features`, the shape of the `pkg/nativejelly-storage` rule. That
    rule passes `--release --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`; here it is the HOST, dev-profile
    graph of the same package and binary, because the property checked (which crates cargo would
    compile for this binary) is decided by the package graph, not by the profile or the triple.
and fails on any unit that belongs to the app package -- its library, and also its build script,
which is a compile of the app package too. The graph is what cargo would build, fresh or not, so a
cached library still counts, and no target directory is read, so stale files from an older
checkout cannot matter. This used to compile both invocations and read the `compiler-artifact`
records (about 7 s of rustc on the serial cargo path of `make check`); the unit graph says the same
thing without running rustc.

The package that owns the binary is asked of `cargo metadata` rather than hard-coded, so the same
script is red on the old layout (the owner IS `nativejelly-modules`) for the right reason.
