"""Build `PlxNative.app` — the app core as a SELF-CONTAINED macOS application.

This is the `hostsim` build (`rust-modules/src/bin/sim.rs`): the same UI, the same Plex data layer
and the same event loop the television runs, wrapped in a bundle that carries its own SDL, its own
fonts and its own copy of every non-system library it links, so it starts on a Mac that has none of
this repo's build environment installed. What it is NOT is a television — there is no video
pipeline off-device (`player/ffi_host.rs`), so Play lands on the app's real failure read-out.
`docs/macos-app.md` is the full account of what is and is not in it.

Three things here are load-bearing, and each is a way this ships broken while working perfectly on
the machine that built it:

  1. **Every non-system dylib is copied in and its recorded path REWRITTEN.** Homebrew records
     absolute install paths (`/opt/homebrew/opt/sdl2_ttf/lib/…`) which resolve on this Mac and on
     no other. The walk is transitive because the second level is where it bites: SDL2_ttf pulls
     freetype, freetype pulls libpng and brotli.
  2. **sdl2-compat loads SDL3 with `dlopen`, not through a load command.** `otool -L` on its
     libSDL2 names no SDL3 at all, so a dependency walk cannot see it; the first name it tries is
     `@loader_path/libSDL3.dylib`. Miss this and the bundle dies at `SDL_Init` on every Mac without
     Homebrew — i.e. on every Mac you would send it to and none you would test it on.
  3. **The bundle is ad-hoc CODESIGNED last.** Apple Silicon refuses to execute unsigned code, and
     every `install_name_tool` write invalidates an existing signature.

Why Python and not a shell script: macOS ships bash 3.2 (no associative arrays), and this is a
graph walk with a verification pass. Same reasoning as `ci/mkipk.py`.

Usage:  ci/mkmacapp.py [--out DIR] [--zip] [--target-dir DIR]

    this process's environment, so it reads the same `NJ_RELEASE` — absent under `make macapp`,

    panel says `0.6.0-dev`: the very ambiguity the suffix exists to remove, recreated on the one
    artifact that is handed to somebody who has none of this checkout.

    that does not relax for an ad-hoc-signed bundle — LaunchServices and anything else that
    compares or displays a bundle version is entitled to assume the shape and to do what it likes
    with `0.6.0-dev`.

    **Not `version()` with the suffix stripped**, which is the obvious spelling and is wrong: that

    release that does not exist — strictly worse than naming the one it was built from. The dev
    distinction goes where it costs nothing instead: the archive filename, `CFBundleGetInfoString`
