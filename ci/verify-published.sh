# Everything that can be asserted BEFORE publishing lives in ci/check-package.py, which CI runs on
# every build. This script exists for the half that cannot: it needs a published release to look
# at. It downloads the real assets and re-derives every claim from them — the hash in four places,
# whether `shasum -c` works where a user stands, who uploaded the files, and whether any payload
# file carries a build machine's directory layout.
#
# It is a CI job, not a checklist item, for the reason the whole exercise exists: v0.2.1 was
# published by hand, which skipped every gate, and a checklist would have been skipped with them.
#
# `com.sostk.nativejelly` is written out three times below and every one is deliberate, not a leftover
# the FLAVOR work missed: a release is always the STABLE flavour, never `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`
# (docs/two-installs.md). The trailing `/` in the `applications/com.sostk.nativejelly/` payload path is
# load-bearing for the flip side of the same fact — the stable id is a PREFIX of the debug id, so an
# unanchored match would also walk a debug install's directory if one ever landed in an archive.

# A build-machine path in a shipped file. Anchored on a non-path character so ordinary URLs do not

# The NDK's own location is unavoidable: --cross-prefix must be absolute (the wrapper gcc dies when
# invoked through PATH), so it rides in FFmpeg's recorded configure string. It is identical on every
# CI runner, which is precisely why releases must be built by CI.
ALLOWED='webos-ndk|/home/runner/'

# Extract each PATH individually rather than filtering whole lines. FFmpeg records its entire
# configure invocation as one long string, so the offending `--prefix=/Users/<me>/...` sits on the
# same "line" as the unavoidable `--cross-prefix=/Users/<me>/webos-ndk/...`. A per-line allowlist
# therefore sees "webos-ndk" and passes the whole blob — which is exactly the false pass this
# check existed to prevent, caught only by testing it against a release known to be dirty.
#
# The match KEEPS its leading boundary character and strips it afterwards, because dropping the
# anchor to tokenise reintroduces the opposite error: plex.tv's own `/api/v2/home/users` looks like
# `/home/users` once you extract without context. Both failure modes were observed; this shape is
# the one that gets both right.
