"""Fail if the app crate rebuilds on a second, identical cargo invocation.

`rust-modules/build.rs` once emitted `cargo:rerun-if-changed=<repo>/RELEASE_LINE` whether or not
that file existed. It does not exist on trunk, and cargo treats a MISSING `rerun-if-changed` path as
stale on every invocation (`CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info` prints "stale:
missing .../RELEASE_LINE"). So the build script re-ran every time, its output was re-published, and
the whole ~420k-line app crate recompiled: 30-40 s for a `cargo test --lib --no-run` that changed
nothing, 8 times per `make check`, and again for every lane and every filtered re-run.

Two halves, both reading cargo's own `--message-format=json` records (only lines that parse as JSON
objects with a `reason` are looked at; `cargo test` also prints harness text on stdout):

* `SecondBuildIsFreshTests` builds the real crate twice from `rust-modules/` and demands that the
  second run recompiled nothing of the crate: every `nativejelly_modules` (and `nj_platform`, the
  layer crate whose own build script generates the catalog, and `nj_gfx`, whose build script
  compiles the nanosvg object for its own test binary) compiler-artifact is `fresh`, and the
  crate's build script did not write its output again (cargo replays a
  `build-script-executed` record even for a fresh script, so the mtime of the script's output file
  is read, wherever this cargo keeps it).
  It runs `cargo check --lib --tests --features lab-diagnostics` with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`: the
  very invocation `make check`'s lab line has just run, so its first run is a reuse of that unit
  and the whole file costs a few seconds instead of a second cold compile of the crate. (It used
  to run `cargo build --lib`, full codegen, which only avoided a cold compile because
  `test_no_host_staticlib.py` had just built the same unit.) `check` has the same build-script
  fingerprint as `build`, so the always-dirty hazard is identical; it is only cheaper to observe.
  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` is part of the unit's fingerprint, hence the explicit value: it must match
  the lab line's, whatever the caller exports.

* `MakeAndBareCargoShareAFingerprintTests` builds the real crate the way `make` does (the
  environment `make -s print-cargo-env` reports: every `NJ_*` variable a cargo recipe would see)
  and the way a bare `cargo` does (none), in both orders, and demands the second recompiles
  nothing. Cargo fingerprints an environment variable as an Option, so a variable make exports
  SET-BUT-EMPTY (`NJ_RELEASE=`, `NJ_CHANNEL=`, `NJ_SENTRY_DSN=''`) is a different input from one
  that is unset, and every bare `cargo` (a CI step, rust-analyzer, an agent's `cargo test`) after a
  `make`, and vice versa, recompiled the whole app crate.

* `MarkerStillTriggersTests` keeps the behaviour the always-stale watch was (wrongly) credited with:
  the `RELEASE_LINE` marker appearing, changing and disappearing still re-runs the script, so the
  reported `X.Y.Z-dev` follows the line. It builds a scratch workspace that uses the REAL
  `build.rs` and `src/release_line.rs` against a stub library, in a throwaway repository (the
  appearance is detected through the worktree's `HEAD`, which is what checking out the line moves),
  so the real tree is never touched and nothing app-sized is recompiled. It has no dependencies of
  its own (the catalog and install-identity generators belong to the platform crate's build script
  now) and runs `--offline`.
  It also pins that a missing `.git/logs/HEAD` (reflog off or deleted) does not make the build
  always-dirty, the same hazard through `emit_build_sha`.
