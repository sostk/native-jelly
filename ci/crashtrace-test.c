 * crashtrace-test.c — **actually crash a process, on purpose, and read what the tracer wrote.**
 * Built and run by `make check` with the HOST compiler, linking `src/crashtrace.c` and nothing
 * else. It needs no television, no NDK and no SDL.
 *
 * # What this grades that `ci/crashfmt-test.c` cannot
 *
 * That one tests pure functions: given this string, what does the tracer DECIDE. This one tests
 * the signal path itself, which is the half that has never been proven by anything but use:
 *
 *   1. a real fatal signal reaches the handler at all;
 *   2. a record is actually WRITTEN, to both descriptors, in the shape the tools parse;
 *   3. the process still DIES OF THE ORIGINAL SIGNAL. That is the re-raise to `SIG_DFL`, and what
 *      it buys is SAM seeing a `WIFSIGNALED` exit — NOT a crashd backtrace, which this firmware
 *      never produces for us: `core_pattern` is the bare string `core` and `RLIMIT_CORE` is 0, so
 *      no core is written and the report chain never starts (measured, twice, with deliberate
 *      SIGSEGVs and an empty `/var/log/reports/librdx/`). This comment claimed the backtrace as its
 *      own rationale, which made an empty librdx directory read as a regression rather than as the
 *      expected result. The status has no other witness: a handler that quietly `_exit`ed would
 *      look identical in the log — which is exactly what this app did for seven weeks, unnoticed.
 *   4. a genuine memory fault, not just `raise()`. The null write below is the real thing: the
 *      kernel raises SIGSEGV from a faulting instruction, so the PC in the record is a real
 *      faulting PC and `si_addr` is the address that could not be touched.
 *
 * Each case runs in a FORKED CHILD, because the subject of the test is a process that dies. The
 * parent reads the exit status and the file afterwards.
 *
 * # What it CANNOT see, stated plainly
 *
 * **`/proc/self/maps` does not exist on macOS**, so `scan_maps` returns immediately and the
 * `at:`/`bin:` lines are never produced here. Their DECISION is graded by the pure test; their
 * plumbing is graded only on a television, and the assertions below are conditional on the file
 * existing so this test tells the truth on either host.
 *
 * The registers are likewise Linux/ARM-only (`#if defined(__arm__)` in the tracer), so no `reg:`
 * line appears on this Mac. This test asserts the lines that DO cross both platforms and says so
 * rather than pretending.
