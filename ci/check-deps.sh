# Structure gates for the UI restructure (spec §15.2), as greps over rust-modules/src. Each rule
# is either ZERO outside a named set of files or ALLOWLISTED by file in ci/allow/<rule>.txt, whose
# first line is `# count: N` — the number of entries — and whose entries are repo-relative paths
# with a reason after a tab. `tests/test_harness.py` runs this script and asserts every
# allowlist's count equals its entries, so an allowlist grows only by a deliberate edit of both.
#
# Phase 2 rules (the rest of §15.2 land with the phases that make them true):
#   libm     — the transcendental surface outside machine/src/motion.rs (spec §4.2): logical state must
#              integrate with motion.rs's own exp/sin_cos; a render or colour formula is allowlisted.
#   ticks    — `SDL_GetTicks(` only in app/clock.rs (the one door) and diag/heartbeat.rs.
#   fpflags  — no `fp-contract`, `fast-math` or `+fma` in the build configuration.
#   wall     — `Instant::now`/`SystemTime::now`/`.elapsed()` in ui/ and app/ only in instruments.
#   present  — the present gate's worker door: ONE atomic static in machine/src/present.rs and ONE
#              `wake_from_worker`.
#   effect   — `Effect::` spelled nowhere (the enum is `Fx::`, the app's `AppFx::`).
#   sink     — `tv::sink::installed` and `VideoSink` only under player/, tv/, tv.rs and port.rs
#              (step L15: the Starfish/ACB verbs are the player's alone).
#
# Phase 4 rule (D3 rewrite, phase 12):
#   mutators — a screen (ui/, screens/) or the loop (app/) never calls a data module's MUTATOR directly
#              (`crate::browse::set_cur(`, `crate::search::set_query(`, …): every mutation is a
#              `StoreCmd` applied through the owner's run/step method (e.g. `Bridge::<store>_run`)
#              (spec §14, the (caller, mutator) allowlist — `docs/stores-as-machines.md`). PRODUCTION lines only:
#              a `#[cfg(test)] mod` seeds a store however it likes. The player side joins in phase
#              9: `route/` (both halves of the split — `plan.rs`, the pure selection half, and
#              `decision.rs`, the network/adapter half) and `player/` are scanned the same as
#              `screens/`/`app/` (zero hits at the split, so green on day one; the `wall` rule below
#              is the one that distinguishes the halves: it gates `route/plan.rs` and exempts
#              `route/decision.rs`). Phase 10 adds `dev/`: the dev-trigger arms that used to live
#              in `app/{boot,run,content,mod}.rs` moved to `dev/scenarios.rs`, and a mutator call
#              that moved with them must not launder itself out of this gate's scan. **This was a
#              CALL-SITE gate alone through phase 10, and D3's census (2026-09-10/11) found the
#              hole that shape leaves**: it can only ever prove "nobody currently calls this
#              directly", never "nobody CAN" — a mutator sitting `pub(crate)` and unreached today
#              is one accidental `use` away from a violation the gate would then have to catch by
#              name a second time. `mutators-visibility` (below) is the fix: it reads the
#              DECLARATION line of every real mutator in its owning legacy module and fails if it
#              is anything looser than private/`pub(super)`, so the owner's run/step method (e.g.
#              `Bridge::<store>_run`) (or, for `browse::section_hubs`, a `pub(super)` reached only
#              from its parent `browse`) is
#              the only door BY CONSTRUCTION, not by nobody having tried the other one yet. The
#              two gates are independent and both must be green: a name absent from
#              `mutators-visibility`'s per-file list (a PUMP/landing door like `pump`/`tick`/
#              `land`/`discover_pump`/`take_detail_refresh`, which stays `pub(crate)` BY DESIGN as
#              the sanctioned door between a store and its owning module — see
#              `docs/stores-as-machines.md`) can still be caught calling FROM a screen by the
#              call-site half, and a name whose declaration IS private can still, in principle, be
#              wrapped by a same-file door that leaks it back out — which the call-site half would
#              catch on ITS spelling, not the original's.
#
# Phase 8 rule (§14, §6.2):
#   nav      — a screen under rust-modules/src/screens/ never calls `crate::ui::nav::` (any
#              function) live; it reads `DrawFrame::{page_alpha,chrome_alpha,view_tab,
#              blur_amount,nav_page_alpha}`, populated once per frame by `app/bridge.rs`'s
#              `Rig::navigation_presentation`. `ui/`'s CONTAINERS (popover.rs, glassload.rs,
#              widgets.rs's chrome helpers, the loop's own app/nav.rs and app/run.rs) still call
#              `ui::nav` directly — that is phase 7/12's boundary, not this one's; this gate
#              scans only `screens/`, where the count is zero.
# Phase 10 rules:
#   layer    — a screen (`screens/`) never names `crate::app::`/`super::app::` (§2.1's table). The
#              other half of that table has been gated since phase 2 (`ui/` names no application
#              type); this half was prose until the argument and the mounter moved into
#              `screens/registry.rs`, which is the boundary §0 criterion 5 stands on. Zero, no
#              allowlist.
#   legacypage — `LegacyPage` is spelled NOWHERE under rust-modules/src (§15.2). The type was a
#              route WORD wearing the `Screen` trait, mounted by `AppArg::Legacy`'s fallback arm,
#              and by phase 9 nothing constructed one — every route mounted an owned screen. A
#              fallback nothing takes is not free: it is what stopped the mounter's match from
#              being exhaustive, so a `Route` added without a screen compiled and mounted a blank
#              page instead of failing to build. Zero, with no allowlist: there is no such thing as
#              a legitimate second one.
#   sibling  — a file under `screens/<a>/` or `screens/<a>.rs` never names `crate::screens::<b>`
#              for a different `<b>` (§2.1, §0 criterion 2): a screen talks to the shared
#              vocabulary (`crate::screens::registry`, which the gate allows by name) and to the
#              container, never to its neighbours — reaching into a sibling is what makes a screen
#              impossible to mount, test or delete on its own. Existing violations are
#              ci/allow/sibling-migration.txt, one per FILE, and that list is empty when the
#              criterion is met. The own-module name is not a violation, and `mod.rs`/a submodule
#              of `screens/<a>/` counts as `<a>`.
#   sessionwrite — a screen (screens/, ui/) never calls `plex::session::load(`. `load` is the
#              BOOT/auth door: it mints a `client_id` when there is none and re-persists a
#              plaintext session, so a read turns into `write_atomic` — a temp file, `sync_all`,
#              a rename and a second `sync_all` on the directory. The read-only door is `peek`.
#              `session.rs` has said "it is not [an acceptable trade] on a path a keypress can
#              reach" and "do not add a per-frame reader of this file" since the two doors were
#              split, and a screen still had it: `screens/settings.rs::signed_in` asked the write
#              door twice per Settings open, which on a television with no usable key manager is
#              two flash writes and four fsyncs on the frame the modal mounts — 150-180 ms of
#              `navcommit` when the flash was slow (`fps:modal-ramp`, device-measured 2026-09-09).
#              Nothing failed: both doors return a `Session` and the difference is invisible at the
#              call site, which is exactly what a grep gate is for. Count is zero.

# allowed <rule> <path>: is `path` an entry of ci/allow/<rule>.txt?
# The allowlists are read ONCE, by one `awk`, into a newline-delimited index of `<rule>|<path>`
# keys, and `allowed` is then a `case` — a shell BUILTIN, which forks nothing. The old spelling
# forked a `grep` per candidate LINE and the gates below feed it thousands of them; that, together
# with the per-FILE `awk`+`grep` loops several gates ran over all 420 source files, is what made a
# green run of this script cost 17 s — and `tests/test_harness.py`, which runs it 32 more times to
# prove each gate still catches a planted violation, cost 16 MINUTES of a 20-minute `make check`.
#
# An allowlist entry is `path<TAB>reason`, so the old `^${path}(<TAB>|$)` regex matched exactly the
# first tab-delimited field. That is what the index stores and what the `case` compares, so the
# answer is unchanged — and it is now an exact string comparison rather than a regex, which for a
# path containing `.` is strictly the stricter of the two. The skip pattern is the same one the
# allowlist count rule at the foot of this file uses, so the two cannot disagree about what an
# entry is.
#
# The index is built by `awk` rather than a `while read` + `case` loop because **bash 3.2 — what
# macOS ships, and what `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to here — cannot parse a `case` inside a
# `$( … )` at all**: it scans for the closing paren without parsing, so the `)` ending a case
# pattern terminates the substitution and the `;;` after it is a syntax error. One process reads
# every list, which is what we wanted anyway.

# gate scores 100% production.
#
# **`screens/` joined this list in phase 5b and that was not cosmetic.** The gate's own rule is
# "a SCREEN never calls a data module's mutator directly", and until 5b every screen lived under
# `ui/`, so scanning `ui/` and `app/` scanned every screen there was. The migration moves screens
# to `rust-modules/src/screens/` one family at a time — so from the moment the first one landed,
# the gate was silently blind to exactly the code it exists to police, and a migrated screen could
# call `browse::apply_pins(` with the gate still reporting green. It is the same shape as the hole
# the comment below records (cutting at the FIRST test module and leaving ~700 lines unscanned):
# a gate that passes because it looked at the wrong thing reads identical to one that passes
# because the code is clean.

# outright — and added every real mutator the census found missing entirely: `alt_install`,
# `alt_restamp_owners`, `alt_prune_inactive`, `alt_stand_in`, `record_pins`, `retry_source`,
# `apply_landing`, `take_detail_refresh`.

# a name-only tree scan would drown in unrelated `impl` methods) and fails if it is anything

#
# Deliberately EXCLUDED, both documented here rather than silently absent:
#   - PUMP/landing doors (`pump`, `tick`, `land`, `discover_pump`, `take_detail_refresh`) stay
#     `pub(crate)` BY DESIGN — the sanctioned door between a store and the module `stores::<store>`
#     wraps, not a mutator a screen has any business calling (`docs/stores-as-machines.md`).
#   - `metadata::alt_stand_in` — the census flagged it as "MUTATOR-adjacent" by name alone; it
#     touches no crate-global state at all, a pure `Vec<AltCopy>` builder
#     `screens/alt_sources_tests.rs` calls directly to grade its own shape.
# No other exceptions: `pms::reset` (once tracked as an open item — `app/bridge.rs` and
# `app/recorder.rs` still called it directly from their own `#[cfg(test)] mod`s) is closed, routed
# through `HubsStore::run`/`run_with_directory` (the variant and `pms::run`'s arm both already
# existed) and narrowed to private like every other `pms.rs` mutator.
# One "<file>|<space-separated fn list>" entry per store — a plain array, not `declare -A`: the

# Phase 12 rules (spec §15.2, D4): the gates the earlier phases' own comments above never wrote,
# added here because their preconditions were supposed to have landed by the time this package
# ran. Three of them (route, ladder, hittest — plus the `#[cfg(test)] mod`/`run`-length checks
# below) did NOT find that precondition true when they were WRITTEN, and were landed red on
# purpose: a red result was the accurate signal that D1 (Route/Nav/Trail retirement) was not done,
# not a bug in the gate. **All of them are green now** — PX-OVERLAYS closed `ladder`/`hittest` and
# PX-D1 deleted the `Route` enum, `app/nav.rs` and `ui/trail.rs`, which is what `route`, `fnlen` and
# `testmod` were each waiting on. They stay BLOCKING, which is the whole point: the retirement is
# only finished for as long as nothing re-introduces the shape.

# `ui/text_buffer.rs` — the TextView component built directly on them) and the BODY of an

# (`machine/src/machine.rs`) is the one seam (`TtfMeasure` on device/sim, `TableMeasure` under replay,
# `FixtureMeasure` in host tests), and every real call site now threads it down from its caller —
# but two leaves genuinely could not (each struct's own doc says which and why): `widgets.rs`'s
# `LegacyMeasure` (generic `View::draw` leaves with no capability parameter, and the legacy
# tab-row cache reached only through `app::bridge`, off-limits to this lane) and `login.rs`'s
# `RawTextMeasure` (a host-test-only stand-in for `TtfMeasure`, whose `width` carries a boot-order
# `debug_assert!` that a test with no `init_text` would trip). Both wrap the identical free
# functions `TtfMeasure` does, minus the assert, so detecting the block structurally — rather than
# allowlisting the two files outright — is what keeps this a real zero-tolerance gate: a THIRD

# `tmppath`'s own header used to point at `ci/check-scrub` for; that script does not exist
# anywhere in this tree (checked 2026-09-11 — the closest real analogue is `diag/scrub.rs`'s
# redaction pass, which is Rust, not a shell gate), so the walk below is a from-scratch small
# tokenizer rather than a shared helper. It: (1) strips `//`/`///` comments to end of line, never
# treating a `//` inside a string as one; (2) tracks whether each character is inside a `"…"`
# string literal, honouring `\"` so an escaped quote does not end it early; (3) as it goes,

# immediately before it) — which is what lets a match inside `crate::eventlog::log(&format!("…"))`
# see BOTH enclosing calls, `format!` innermost and the log call beneath it, across as many lines as the
# call spans. A hit is a `/tmp/nativejelly-` match that is NOT inside a string, or is inside one but
# no enclosing call on that stack is `log`/`crate::eventlog::log`/`log!` — i.e. exactly the two exemptions
# D4 names, comment and log-message text, and nothing else (a bare `let s = "/tmp/nativejelly-x";`
# with no log() around it is a hit, deliberately, even though it opens nothing — the spec's own
# wording is "any literal…unless", not "any literal that is also an open"). `dev.rs` is the one
# structural exemption; a second category ("the log sinks") is named in the spec but resolves to
# NOTHING in this tree today — `eventlog::events_log`/`app/boot.rs`'s crash-log open both build the
# path through `paths::in_runtime_dir("nativejelly-…")`, a bare filename with no `/tmp/` prefix, so
