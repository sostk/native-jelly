"""Which install a package is for — a transform from the tracked descriptors to a flavour's.

Three builds of this app live on one television: `stable` is what users install
(`com.sostk.nativejelly` — the id in every release, every manifest and the webosbrew channel listing),
`debug` is the day-to-day developer build beside it (`com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`), with its own
launcher tile, its own sign-in and its own `/tmp` root, and `nightly` (`com.sostk.nativejelly.nightly`)
is a third install beside both — always a `RELEASE=1` build (no dev triggers, ever), with its own
tile ("PlxNative Nightly"), its own sign-in and its own `/tmp` root, that additionally carries a
PACKAGE version ahead of the tracked one (see `appinfo_for`'s nightly arm) and a dated REPORTED
version (`rust-modules/build.rs::emit_version`'s `NJ_CHANNEL=nightly` arm). The Makefile's FLAVOR
block is the account of why; this file is the part that has to be identical in three places at
once.

**PATCH, DO NOT DUPLICATE.** `pkg/appinfo.json` has 15 fields and exactly TWO of them may differ
between flavours: `id` and `title`. The other thirteen — `type`, `main`, `transparent`,
`requiredMemory`, `nativeLifeCycleInterfaceVersion`, `handlesRelaunch`, `splashBackground`,
`iconColor`, `vendor`, `version`, `appDescription` and the two icon FILENAMES — are
behaviour-critical and must never drift. A second checked-in descriptor would drift on them the
first time one was edited, and would put the version in a fifth file that `ci/bump-version.py`, `ci/check-package.py` and
`release.yml`'s tag guard all already read. The selftest asserts the set of moved keys is exactly
`{id, title}`, so widening it is a decision somebody has to make on purpose.

**THE STABLE TRANSFORM IS THE IDENTITY, and that is asserted rather than intended** (`--selftest`,
run by `make check`). It is the whole mechanical guarantee that adding a second identity cannot
perturb the artifact whose sha256 every user's television verifies at install time: if the stable
descriptors come out byte-identical to the tracked files, the package built from them is the
package that was always built.

The install list and storage identities live in `ci/install-identities.json`; `build.rs`
generates the Rust storage schema from it. The stable app id also anchors `paths::STABLE_APP_ID`
and `APPID_STABLE` in the Makefile; `--selftest` checks those existing path conventions against
the manifest.
