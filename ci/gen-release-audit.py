"""Generate the machine-derived half of a release audit, from the artifact itself.

    ci/gen-release-audit.py --tag v0.5.0 --dist dist --write

WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` is what a television owner reads, and it is prose
a person wrote. `docs/release-audits/vX.Y.Z.md` is what a reviewer, a contributor or we-in-a-year
read when the question is "what was actually in that package" — and prose is the wrong instrument
for that, because every measurable number a human has typed into a note in this project's history
has eventually been wrong (`docs/release-notes/README.md` records three). So the audit's evidence
half is not written. It is READ OUT OF THE .ipk that is about to be published, by this script.

Everything below is derived from bytes:

  * the ar container's members, in order, with their sizes;
  * the control file, the app descriptor and the package descriptor;
  * every payload file, with its size, mode, owner and sha256;
  * the binary's ELF class, machine and complete DT_NEEDED list (parsed here, in pure Python —
    no readelf, so this runs on the runner, on a Mac, and on a machine with no NDK);
  * the bundled FFmpeg libraries, their SONAMEs and DT_NEEDED, and the configure invocation
    FFmpeg records inside libavutil — which is where the LGPL position is actually decided, and where v0.2.1's
    build-machine path was found;
  * the dev-trigger witnesses, counted rather than asserted, so "none" is a measurement;
  * host- and path-shaped strings in the shipped binary, as a FLOOR on what it can reach.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, said here rather than discovered later. A string table is evidence of presence,
never of absence: a host the binary assembles at runtime from pieces does not appear, and a string
that appears may be a log message rather than a destination (the `strings` output of a release
build has always contained `/tmp/nativejelly-url` for exactly that reason). The scan is reported as
what it is — a floor — and the audit's authored half is where a claim about the whole surface is
made and attributed. Anything needing a human, a television or a third party is authored: this
script never writes a sentence about device testing or compatibility, and refuses to guess one.

Stdlib only, and no network. Reads the artifacts it is pointed at and nothing else.
