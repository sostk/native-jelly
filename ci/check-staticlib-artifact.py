"""Prove the archive `make` is about to link is the one cargo just reported.

usage: check-staticlib-artifact.py <cargo --message-format=json output> <archive path>

make decides what to link by a timestamp on the archive path, and cargo does not always write it
(a fresh unit only re-links the old file; a failed or skipped uplift leaves whatever was there).
Since the crate declares `crate-type = ["rlib"]`, the `.a` exists only because the Makefile asks
`cargo rustc --crate-type staticlib` for it, so a silent miss would link an OLD archive with no
comment. cargo names every file it produced or vouches for in its `compiler-artifact` records;
this requires exactly one `.a` for the app crate there and that the path make links is that file.
Timestamps cannot do this: a fresh build legitimately leaves the archive older than the recipe.
