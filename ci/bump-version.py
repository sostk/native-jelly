"""The ONE place that knows where this project's version is written.

Four files carry it and they must never disagree — `ci/check-package.py` fails the build if they
do, and webosbrew's registry reads the version out of the archive, so a mismatch is a rejected
submission rather than a warning:

    pkg/appinfo.json            the SOURCE. The Makefile derives IPK_VERSION (and so the .ipk
                                filename) from it, and release.yml refuses to publish a tag that
                                disagrees with it.
    ipkroot/ctl/control         Version: — read by opkg and by webosbrew's repogen.
    rust-modules/Cargo.toml     what every version the app REPORTS is derived from —
                                X-Plex-Version, the telemetry release, the diagnostics panel.
                                `rust-modules/build.rs` publishes it as `NJ_VERSION`, exactly
                                for a RELEASE build and as the next MINOR plus `-dev` for
                                everything else, so a working tree stops claiming to be the
                                last release. That suffix exists only in the binary.
    rust-modules/Cargo.lock     cargo would fix this itself on the next build, but leaving it
                                stale means the very next `make` produces a dirty tree — which on
                                a release commit is exactly when you least want one.

Usage:
    ci/bump-version.py --current          print the current version and exit
    ci/bump-version.py patch|minor|major  compute the next version and write it

`patch` stays supported here and is NOT what trunk cuts. Development is trunk-based: `main` cuts
minors and majors, and a patch belongs to an existing minor's own maintenance line —
`.github/workflows/release.yml` refuses to publish a version that does not end in `.0` when it is
checking out, tagging and pushing `main` (the default), and enforces the matching `X.Y.N` (`N>=1`)
rule instead when its `line` dispatch input names a `release/vX.Y` branch to cut a patch from. This
script itself never reads which line it is running on; the level lives here because that is where
the arithmetic lives, and the policy is enforced where the release is actually cut.
    ci/bump-version.py 1.2.3              write an explicit version
    ci/bump-version.py patch --dry-run    print what would change, write nothing

Exactly three integers, always: LG rejects anything else, and `ci/check-package.py` asserts it.
There is deliberately no pre-release or build-metadata support — `1.0.0-rc1` is not installable
on a webOS TV, so accepting it here would only let it fail later. The `-dev` suffix a developer
build reports is not an exception to that: it is added by `rust-modules/build.rs` to the string
the RUNNING app reports and never written to any of the four files below.
