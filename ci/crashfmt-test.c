 * crashfmt-test.c — host test for `src/crashfmt.h`, the pure half of the crash tracer.
 * Built and run by `make check` with the HOST compiler; it links nothing and needs no television.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * The tracer itself can only be graded on a television: it runs in signal context on ARM, and
 * nothing on this Mac can fault an ARM process. But the part of it that has actually been WRONG
 * has never been the syscalls — it has been the parsing, and a wrong `bin:` line is silent:
 * `tools/crash-report.sh` subtracts that mapping's base from the PC and answers with a confident
 * wrong function rather than failing. Its twin is recorded in that script, on the app id, because
 * `com.sostk.nativejelly` is a PREFIX of `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`.
 *
 * **Written by watching it fail.** `plx_names_our_binary` was reverted to the bare substring test
 * before this file was trusted, and exactly one assertion below went red — `nativejelly-sim`. That
 * result is itself the finding: it disproved the justification `src/main.c` had carried since the
 * tracer was written (that a substring test would also match `libturbojpeg.so.0` beside the
 * binary), because the needle carries a slash and the directory component is `/com.sostk.nativejelly`.
 * The libturbojpeg case is still asserted below, but as what it really is — a line that is not our
 * binary for a reason that has nothing to do with the separator — and `crashfmt.h`'s comment now
 * says which cases the separator actually buys.
 *
 * # What it cannot see
 *
 * The host compiler, not the NDK's GCC 12; a 64-bit `unsigned long`, not the target's 32-bit one.
 * Neither matters for what is asserted here — every function under test is pure C99 over values
 * the caller supplies — but it does mean this proves the LOGIC and never the codegen. The
 * cross-build's own `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` covers the second half.
