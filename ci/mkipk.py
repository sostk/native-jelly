"""Build the .ipk — the `ar` container and both `.tar.gz` members — deterministically.

Why not `tar czf`: it embeds the developer's uid/gid/username (`gleblinnik/staff` was shipping
inside every .ipk), the current mtime, a gzip header timestamp, and readdir order. That makes the
sha256 in the manifest — which every user's TV verifies at install time — different on every run,
so you cannot tell a rebuild from a tampered artifact.

Why Python rather than tar flags: the flags differ irreconcilably between GNU tar (Linux CI:
--owner=/--group=/--sort=) and bsdtar (the dev Mac: --uid/--gid/--uname/--gname, no --sort).
tarfile gives both hosts the same bytes with no branching.

WHICH INSTALL a package is for comes from `$FLAVOR` (see `ci/flavor.py`): unset or `stable` builds
the app users install, `debug` builds `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`, which sits beside it on the same
television. Every id in the archive — the control `Package:`, `packageinfo.json`, the staged
`applications/<id>/` directory and the `.ipk` filename — comes from that one transform, and the
directory is additionally what the installed binary reads to learn which install it is
(`paths::app_id`). They are asserted equal here and again in `ci/check-package.py`.

This module also writes THREE things the ipk carries and a scp-based dev loop never needed. The
first two are SYNTHESISED from `pkg/appinfo.json`, so the version stays single-sourced; the third
is a TRANSFORM of the tracked `pkg/resources/` tree, which carries no version and no id at all —
and that is a gate rather than a convention (`ci/check-package.py` fails a localized descriptor
with any third property). Only the first is load-bearing for installation; the third is metadata
whose absence registers an app perfectly well and costs it its language.

  * `usr/palm/packages/<id>/packageinfo.json` — webOS's *package* descriptor, distinct from the
    *application* descriptor `appinfo.json`. `com.webos.appInstallService` reads it to learn which
    app ids a package owns; without it an install leaves nothing registered. It was absent from
    every ipk this repo ever built, undetected because the dev loop is `make deploy` (scp into an
    already-registered app dir), which never consults it. `webosbrew-ipk-verify` opens it first and
    reports the miss as `Failed to open <the ipk>: No such file or directory` — the ipk's own name,
    not the member's, so the error reads like a corrupt archive.
  * `Installed-Size` in the control file — opkg checks it against free space before unpacking.
    Verifiers ignore the literal `1234`, the dummy `ares-package` emits, so it must be real.
  * `resources/<locale>/appinfo.json` — the LOCALIZED descriptors, staged from the tracked
    `pkg/resources/` tree. Same reason as the two above: the ipk is the only artifact that carries
    them, `make deploy` has no use for them (the launcher tile of a developer install is not what
    LG's QA looks at), and the Makefile's `APP_FILES` is a flat `cp … $(STAGE)/` that cannot
    express a two-level tree. `stage_resources` is where the FLAVOUR suffix is reapplied — see its
    docstring for why a flavoured package that skipped that step would lose its badge in every
    non-English locale.

WHY NOT `ares-package` (LG's own packager, which webosbrew's submission check asks for): it is NOT
REPRODUCIBLE. Measured with ares-cli 2.4.0 on this payload — two runs of byte-identical input give
two different sha256. That breaks the one integrity property this distribution has: nothing in the
chain is code-signed, so the manifest hash a user's TV verifies at install is only meaningful if a
third party can rebuild the package and get the same bytes, which the README tells them to do.
Everything else ares-package does, this file already does identically — the same bare `ar` member
names, the same `usr/palm/applications/<id>` + `usr/palm/packages/<id>/packageinfo.json` layout
(verified by diffing an ares-built package against ours) — and one thing it does better:
`Installed-Size` here is KiB, per Debian and what opkg expects, where ares-package writes BYTES.
The control file carries `webOS-Package-Format-Version` and `webOS-Packager-Version` so the
submission check's presence heuristic is satisfied honestly; the packager string names this file
rather than impersonating theirs.

And it writes the `ar` container itself rather than shelling out to `ar`, because **GNU `ar` produces
an ipk LG's installer cannot read**. GNU format terminates every short member name with `/`, so the
members arrive as `debian-binary/`, `control.tar.gz/`, `data.tar.gz/`; `appinstalld` looks up the
exact names and fails the whole package with `error_code -5, "Failed to extract package"` before
anything is unpacked. `dpkg-deb` and `ares-package` both write the bare names, which is what the
format actually calls for — the trailing slash is a GNU archiver convention for disambiguating
names from its long-name table, not part of `ar`. 60 bytes of header per member is less machinery
than depending on any particular archiver's conventions, and it drops the cross-`ar` requirement
from packaging, so `make ipk` no longer needs the NDK.
