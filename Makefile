# plxnative — native webOS build (cross-compiled from macOS with the webOS NDK)
#
# Toolchain: the webosbrew "native-toolchain" buildroot SDK (GCC 12, glibc 2.12,
# armv7-a soft-float). Install it once with `make setup-env` (or see the
# setup-environment skill); override the location with WEBOS_SDK=… if you put it
# elsewhere. The SDK ships a real sysroot with the TV's own SONAME'd libraries
# (SDL2/GLESv2/wayland/glib/luna-service2 + LG's libplayerAPIs/libpf), so we link
# against the real thing.
#
# THE STUB .so TRICK IS GONE. It existed so FFmpeg and libcurl — absent from the
# sysroot, or present under the wrong SONAME — could be named in DT_NEEDED and
# resolved to the TV's real libraries at runtime. But a DT_NEEDED entry is a hard
# requirement for one exact SONAME, and those SONAMEs move between webOS releases
# (FFmpeg 55->57->58->59->60, curl .so.5->.so.4, libAcbAPI deleted at 5.0), so the
# trick pinned the binary to webOS 4.x: on anything newer the loader killed it at
# exec(), before main, before the event log existed. Those libraries are now
# dlopen'd by SONAME candidate list instead — rust-modules/base/src/dynlib.rs, and the
# video-plane comment at the top of src/starfish.c. `tools/fwcompat.py` grades the
# result against 14 real firmware inventories without leaving the desk.
#
# make          — build pkg/plxnative
# make setup-env— download+extract+relocate the NDK into $(WEBOS_SDK)
# make deploy   — scp binary + appinfo to the TV (rooted, root@TV)
# make run      — launch on TV, keep alive $(RUN_SECS)s, fetch event log
# make test     — build + deploy + run
# make kill     — close the app on the TV
# make ipk      — repackage pkg/<app id>_<version>_arm.ipk (version from appinfo.json)
# make install  — install THIS flavour on the TV from its own .ipk, then deploy into it
# make uninstall— remove this flavour from the TV (refuses the stable id)
#
# FLAVOR selects WHICH INSTALL every TV-facing target talks to: `debug` (the default —
# com.beb.plxnative.debug, its own tile, its own sign-in, its own /tmp root) or `stable`
# (com.beb.plxnative, the app users install). See the FLAVOR block below for why the default is the
# developer one. A flavour must be `make FLAVOR=… install`ed once before `deploy` can reach it.
#
# RELEASE=1 drops BOTH default cargo features: `devtools` (the on-screen counter) and
# `devtriggers` (the /tmp trigger surface, the remote FIFO, the capture listener — see
# rust-modules/src/dev.rs). It must be on EVERY invocation that produces or ships the
# binary — `make RELEASE=1 deploy`, not
# `make RELEASE=1 && make deploy`, which rebuilds as dev and deploys that. Both targets echo
# which configuration they are shipping.

# Which television. `make TV=1.2.3.4 …` overrides for one invocation; otherwise it comes from the
# gitignored `.tv-host` (one line, an IP or hostname), so this repository carries nobody's home
# network. `tools/` reads the same file via $TV_HOST. Absent, the targets that need a TV say so.
# The second `cat` is for a LINKED WORKTREE, and it is not a convenience: `.tv-host` is gitignored,
# so a worktree cut from this repo has none — and worktrees are exactly where the parallel agents
# live. Without it, the checkouts most likely to collide over the one television are also the only
# ones that cannot ask `tools/tv-lock.sh` who is holding it, which is how a lane ends up dialling
# `root@` out of somebody's memory instead. `--git-common-dir` is the MAIN checkout's `.git` from
# anywhere in the worktree family (and plain `.git` in the main one, where the first cat already won).
TV       ?= $(strip $(shell cat .tv-host 2>/dev/null || cat "$$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)/../.tv-host" 2>/dev/null))
# Every ssh/scp this Makefile runs goes through `tools/tv-ssh`: the ssh KEY first, `sshpass -p alpine`
# only when the set refuses the key (so `sshpass` is optional on a machine whose key is authorized),
# and a fast "the TV is unreachable" for a set that is asleep. `tv` / `tv:` are placeholders the
# wrapper expands to `root@<address>` itself, which is the point: make echoes recipe lines, and a
# line that carried the address and the password put both into every terminal and agent transcript
# a `make deploy` ever scrolled through. The address reaches the wrapper through the environment
# (`make TV=...` is exported) or the same gitignored `.tv-host`; with neither, the wrapper fails
# with "no TV configured" instead of dialling `root@`. `alpine` is NOT a secret (webosbrew's
# published dev-mode root password, the same on every rooted set); the ADDRESS is what identified
# one household, and that stays local. See tools/tv-ssh for the contract.
# TV_CHECK expands to nothing when a TV is configured and stops make otherwise, so a recipe never
# dials an empty address (it used to be `root@$(TV_OR_DIE)`; without this a deploy with no TV
# says "does not exist ... make install", which is the wrong advice).

# --- THE TELEVISION IS A MUTEX, and this is what enforces it -------------------------------
#
# One dev set, one app instance, no OS-level lock: two jobs on it do not fail cleanly, they
# produce plausible WRONG data (a bogus timeline_climb, an fps number measured while somebody
# else's binary was being deployed underneath). Every recipe below that TOUCHES the television
# takes `tv-lock-require` as its first prerequisite, so the refusal happens before the first scp
# rather than halfway through one.
#
# It is cheap: `require` re-checks a lease this lane verified in the last minute from a local file,
# with no ssh at all, which is what makes it affordable on `run-stream` — a recipe tests/run.py
# invokes once per case. And it is not a gate you have to remember: with nobody holding the set it
# takes a short implicit lease rather than failing, so a lone `make deploy` still works and still
# cannot collide with a fleet job. A SESSION should take a real one (`tools/tv-lock.sh acquire`),
# because the gap between two of your own commands is where another lane lands.
#
# With no television configured this must stay silent and let the recipe's own ssh produce the
# familiar error, not replace it with a complaint about a lock. The address is deliberately NOT
# passed on the command line (`TV=$(TV)`): make echoes it, and it reaches tv-lock.sh through the
# environment or `.tv-host` anyway.

# --- WHICH INSTALL: the FLAVOR axis --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Three builds live on one television: `stable` is the app users get (`com.beb.plxnative`, the id
# in every release, manifest and channel listing); `debug` is the day-to-day developer build
# beside it (`com.beb.plxnative.debug`) with its own launcher tile, its own sign-in and its own
# runtime files; `nightly` (`com.beb.plxnative.nightly`) is a third install beside both — same
# per-flavour shape (own tile, own sign-in, own runtime root) but ALWAYS a RELEASE=1 build (see
# `release-guard` below), with its own bumped package version and a dated reported version
# (`rust-modules/build.rs::emit_version`'s `PLX_CHANNEL=nightly` arm). webOS keys everything — the
# install directory, SAM's launch/closeByAppId, the LS2 role file — on that id, so distinct ids are
# distinct apps that cannot touch each other.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS `debug`, IN THIS TRACKED FILE, and that is a deliberate asymmetry rather than a
# preference. Every command in this repo's muscle memory, every skill recipe and every harness
# invocation is spelled `make deploy` / `make run` / `./tests/run.py` with no flavour, and each one
# used to overwrite the only install there was. The two mistakes are not comparable: deploying to
# `debug` when you meant `stable` costs you retyping one command, while deploying to `stable` when
# you meant `debug` destroys a working install — possibly mid-film, with no undo, on the app the
# household actually watches with. So the safe one is what you get for free and the other has to be
# asked for by name.
#
# Tracked rather than a gitignored `.app-flavor` dotfile (which is how `.tv-host` works, and was the
# obvious thing to copy): a fresh clone, and especially a fresh worktree in an agent fleet, has no
# dotfile — so the dangerous default would be inherited invisibly by exactly the checkouts nobody
# is watching.
#
# The whitelist is not decoration. `make FLAVOR=stabel deploy` would otherwise mint a third
# registered app called `com.beb.plxnative.stabel` on the television (LG's id charset accepts it,
# so nothing downstream objects) and the symptom is a mystery tile on a TV rather than a message on
# a terminal. `$(error)` at parse time costs one line.

# instead of restating it a fourth time.
#
# The stable install keeps `/tmp` byte for byte, so every existing recipe, doc line and harness
# glob stays true for the app users get. A flavoured install gets `/tmp/<app id>` — a DOT in the

# tool RESOLVED and the flavour it deploys, kills and launches with are one value, and cannot
# disagree (closing install A while launching install B reproduces SAM's stale-running no-op and
# then grades the wrong app's log).
#
# NOT `make -p`/`make -pn`, which is what these replace: that prints a RECURSIVE variable's

# echoing real values cannot do that. See PURE_QUERY below for why they are also side-effect free.
# The capture listener's TCP port for THIS install. Two installs cannot both bind one port, and
# the failure is silent on both sides — the second bind fails with one line in a log nobody is
# tailing, and the operator then watches one install's picture while every key they type goes into
# the other install's FIFO. `capture::default_port` is the same rule in Rust; ci/flavor.py's
# selftest compares them. Nightly was the third flavour that comment warned about: "stable, or one
# higher" stopped being a rule with three installs, so each flavour now gets its own explicit slot
# instead of a wildcard — stable 8910, debug 8911, nightly 8912.

# make deploy` succeeds end to end and ships whatever binary was already sitting in pkg/, which is
# exactly the stale-binary trap the header-dependency rule further down exists to prevent. Pinning
# it here also survives the next block that gets added above `all:`.

# The C-side twin of RUST_REMAP below, for the exact same reason: `-g` writes the CURRENT
# WORKING DIRECTORY (`DW_AT_comp_dir`) and every `-I`/sysroot path into DWARF, which
# --remap-path-prefix cannot touch — that flag is rustc's, and GCC never sees it. Found on the
# first release build that ever combined SYMBOLS=1 with ci/check-elf.sh's build-host-identity
# scan (both existed before; this exact pairing had not): pkg/plxnative, built with SYMBOLS=1 on
# CI, carried five `/home/runner/work/plx-native/plx-native/.webos-ndk/…/sysroot/usr/include…`
# strings and the bare checkout root, both from GCC's DWARF, not rustc's. Same broad-then-
# specific order as RUST_REMAP and the same reasoning: WEBOS_SDK defaults under $(HOME) but is
# user-overridable to anywhere.
#
# The checkout root ($(CURDIR), where every .c file and -I path this build compiles actually
# lives) is its OWN specific mapping rather than being left to the $(HOME) catch-all, and it goes
# LAST for the same tie-break reason RUST_REMAP's comment gives — reproduced directly against this
# NDK's gcc rather than assumed: a throwaway `-g` compile with two overlapping
# -fdebug-prefix-map values showed the LAST matching one wins DW_AT_comp_dir, not the first or the
# longest. Without this, a checkout whose path is nested under $(HOME) (true of every case measured
# so far — this Mac, and CI's /home/runner/work/…) still has that FIXED "/build" prefix, but the
# home-relative REMAINDER — worktree name, CI's repo-name-twice segment — still varies build to
# build, which is exactly the gap a symbol-server upload should not have and CI's runner path

# v0.5.0; `--include-sources` in release.yml is new since v0.5.0 and had never actually run in a
# published release as of the build that added this comment, so whether it hard-fails an empty
# source bundle or degrades to file+line-only symbolication was NOT determined before shipping. The

#
#   libcurl and libAcbAPI: their SONAMEs MOVE between releases (curl .so.5 -> .so.4, ACB deleted
#   outright at webOS 5.0). A DT_NEEDED entry is a hard requirement for one exact name, cannot say
#   "either of these", and a name the device lacks kills the process at exec() — before main,
#   before the event log exists. So they are dlopen'd by SONAME CANDIDATE LIST:
#   rust-modules/base/src/dynlib.rs, and the video-plane comment at the top of src/starfish.c.
#
#   FFmpeg is not a version question at all any more: we SHIP our own, pinned (the bundled-FFmpeg
#   section below builds libav*-plx.so.63/63/61 and stages them into pkg/). It is unlinked because
#   those files land BESIDE the binary, which is on no library search path, and they carry no rpath
#   — so a DT_NEEDED entry would be resolved at exec() against the system path, where it either
#   finds nothing (dead before main) or finds the TELEVISION's copy, which is the wrong one:
#   webOS 11.2.0 ships FFmpeg 6 itself. ff.rs::load_libraries opens the three by ABSOLUTE PATH out
#   of paths::app_dir(), one pinned SONAME each, in dependency order under RTLD_GLOBAL — not a
#   candidate list, and nothing is being tolerated.
#
# The old wording ("FFmpeg 55->57->58->59->60") described the app that read the TV's FFmpeg, and it
# survived the bundling by 100 lines. Left alone it points the next reader at version tolerance we
# no longer need and at a library we no longer use — which is how "just use the TV's libavformat
# for https" keeps coming back, when the copy we ship is configured --disable-network and cannot
# open a URL at all. `docs/agent-reference.md`'s "Linking" section carries the same account at length.

# Rust-first build. The app is Rust (rust-modules/, compiled to a staticlib and
# linked in); C is only main.c (boot shim) + starfish.c (the StarfishMediaAPIs
# C++/ACB seam) + svg.c (nanosvg rasterizer).
# (src/gpdebug.c is a debug-only guard-page allocator — never in the normal build.)
# RELEASE=1 drops BOTH default cargo features — `devtools` (the on-screen seven-segment counter,
# app.rs) and `devtriggers` (the whole /tmp surface, src/dev.rs). Neither may ship to users.
# See rust-modules/Cargo.toml's [features].
#
# The stamp exists because of this project's classic stale-artifact trap: cargo fingerprints the
# feature set and would rebuild, but MAKE would never invoke it — toggling RELEASE=1 touches no
# file, so the recipe looks up to date and the PREVIOUS feature set's staticlib gets linked with
# no comment. Depending on a stamp whose CONTENT is the flag makes the switch a real prerequisite.
# RELEASE=1 drops BOTH default cargo features — `devtools` (the on-screen seven-segment counter,
# app.rs) and `devtriggers` (the whole /tmp surface, src/dev.rs). Neither may ship to users.
# See rust-modules/Cargo.toml's [features].
#
# Each feature set gets its OWN target dir, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Cargo names
# the staticlib by crate, so both builds would otherwise write the SAME libplxnative_modules.a —
# and cargo fingerprints the build without hashing its output, so after a RELEASE=1 build it
# reports the dev build "Finished in 0.04s" and leaves the release .a sitting there. `make` then
# links it with no comment: a release binary shipped as if it were the tested dev one. Measured,
# not theorised. Separate dirs also let make track each artifact honestly.
#
# **LAB=1** adds one more feature — `lab-diagnostics`, the diagnostics + control Cloud Test Lab bridge
# (`docs/lab-diagnostics.md`). It is a THIRD configuration, with its own target dir for exactly
# the reason above, and it composes with RELEASE: `make LAB=1 RELEASE=1 …` is a release-featured
# binary that can still upload a snapshot, which is the configuration a submission candidate is
# actually tested in. The feature is not in the default set at all, so no ordinary build and no
# forgotten flag can produce it.
# INCREMENTAL COMPILATION, OFF IN A LINKED WORKTREE — the single biggest thing on this disk.
#
# Measured 2026-09-03 across twelve fleet lanes plus the main checkout: 45 GB of derived trees, of
# which **24 GB was `target*/debug/incremental` alone** — 1.2 to 4.0 GB per lane, more than the
# object code beside it, on a volume with 3.2 GiB free. FFmpeg, which is what everyone assumes is
# eating the disk, was 2.6 GB of that 45.
#
# Incremental compilation is a cache of the LAST build, so it pays for itself over a long series
# of small edits in one tree. A fleet lane is the opposite shape: it is cut for one task, compiles
# a handful of times and is deleted — and it pays the full multi-gigabyte cache for every one of
# those compiles anyway, N times over, because nothing about it is shared between worktrees.
#
# So a LINKED WORKTREE gets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` and the main checkout keeps its cache. The test
# is `.git` being a FILE rather than a directory, which is exactly what distinguishes the two (a
# linked worktree's `.git` is a one-line gitdir pointer). `?=` means an explicit
# `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 make check` still wins, for a lane that really is doing long iterative work
# — it costs a few GB and it is yours to spend.
#
# The cost is real and worth stating: a rebuild after a one-line edit in a lane recompiles the
# crate rather than patching it. That is seconds per compile against gigabytes per lane.
# (`export VAR ?= v` on one line is silently a no-op under the make 3.81 macOS ships — measured
# here, `$(origin CARGO_INCREMENTAL)` came back `undefined` — so the assignment and the export are

# by mtime alone, so a cloned app artifact could be linked silently) and refreshes the seed under
# ~/.cache/plxnative/cargo-seed/ after a build finishes. A clone costs no disk until a file is

# waits on it. See the script's docstring for the safety argument. Not hooked into

# WHICH VERSION THE BINARY REPORTS, which is not always the version it was cut from. A release
# commit leaves the whole tree at the version it just published, so every developer build after it
# reported that exact number as its own — in X-Plex-Version, in the Sentry release, on the
# diagnostics panel — and nothing downstream could tell a working tree from the shipped artifact.
# `rust-modules/build.rs` reads this ONE variable: set, the binary says `0.6.0`; unset or empty, it
# says `0.7.0-dev`, the next MINOR — trunk is where features land, so that is what is cut from it
# next; a patch release comes off an existing minor's own line. Exported (rather than per recipe) so
# the cross-build, `make check`, `make sim` and `make macapp` cannot answer differently — they run
# cargo from four places, and the failure of missing one is a mislabelled artifact, not an error.
#
# It is deliberately NOT in $(RUST_CFG), and `override` is what makes that safe. RELEASE is
# already in the stamp and gives each configuration its own --target-dir, so a flip through the
# supported door rebuilds a DIFFERENT .a and cargo re-runs the script for it. What the stamp could
# not have caught is somebody decoupling this from RELEASE by hand — `make PLX_RELEASE=1 deploy`
# (a command-line variable outranks an ordinary assignment) or `make -e` with it exported — which
# would write a binary reporting 0.6.0 into the DEV target dir, leave RUST_CFG unmoved, and let
# every later plain `make` link that stale library without a word. `override` makes the value a
# function of RELEASE and nothing else, which is the property the stamp is relying on.
#
# The suffix never reaches pkg/appinfo.json or ipkroot/ctl/control — LG takes three integers and
# nothing else, and `ci/check-package.py` asserts both that and, for the stable id, that the
# packaged binary is not a `-dev` one.
#
# TWO STATEMENTS, not one — and the precise culprit is narrower than CARGO_INCREMENTAL's own
# comment above suggests. Isolated on this Mac's make 3.81: plain `export VAR := value` and
# `export VAR ?= value` both work, on one line, with or without `override`; what is a silent
# no-op is `override export VAR := value` — override AND export STACKED on one line — which sets
# the value for make's own expansions but never reaches a child process's environment. That is
# exactly what happened here: `RELEASE=1` correctly drove `RUST_FEATFLAGS`, so the cargo
# invocation used the right feature set, while the linked binary's `PLX_VERSION` still read
# `0.7.0-dev` with no error from anything, because PLX_RELEASE never left make. `override` has to
# stay on the assignment, not the export, or a command-line `PLX_RELEASE=1` could outrank this
# derivation again.
#
# EXPORTED ONLY WHEN NON-EMPTY, and `unexport`ed otherwise. Cargo fingerprints an environment
# variable as an Option: `PLX_RELEASE=` (set, blank) is a different input from PLX_RELEASE unset.
# `build.rs` watches this variable with `rerun-if-env-changed`, so exporting it blank for every
# dev build made every bare `cargo` (a CI step, rust-analyzer, an agent's `cargo test --lib foo`)
# rerun the build script and recompile the whole app crate after a `make`, and the next `make`
# recompile it back — 35-120 s each way, invisible because both builds succeed. Unset it is the
# same fingerprint a bare `cargo` has, and `build.rs` already reads blank and unset as the same
# thing, so the binary is unchanged. `make -s print-cargo-env` shows what a cargo recipe receives

# unreachable, and `make RELEASE=1` shipped the libraries built for a DEV configuration — while
# the comment two blocks below claimed otherwise. Building release-first then dev is worse: the
# swscale staging rule globs a prefix that has none and the build dies.
# SYMBOLS belongs in the stamp for the same reason RELEASE and the FFmpeg configuration do, and the
# failure it prevents is the sharpest one here: a debuginfo build and a plain one produce DIFFERENT
# BUILD IDs (measured — 3ede46f8… vs cc4a5c7b… for the same sources), and the build id is the only
# thing that matches a separated `.debug` back to the binary a crash came from. Without this,
# `make RELEASE=1 ipk` followed by `make RELEASE=1 SYMBOLS=1 symbols` silently relinks a different
# binary and hands you a `.debug` that will never match anything a user's television reports — the
# same shape as `make RELEASE=1 && make deploy`, which is the trap this whole mechanism exists for.
# The telemetry endpoints, read out of the gitignored pkg/telemetry.local.json and handed to the
# compiler as option_env! values. Absent file, absent key, EMPTY value -> the constant is None and

# building from source get a binary with no endpoint in it at all. That is the safe direction and
# it is a property of the artifact rather than of a runtime flag.
#
# **FOUR values, in two PAIRS, and the pair decides the environment.** This is not symmetry for its
# own sake: the build's `environment` field is derived from WHICH pair it was given
# (`telemetry::sender::ENVIRONMENT`), so a binary cannot label itself `production` while sending to
# the dev project. The first draft derived it from the feature set instead, and
# `make RELEASE=1 FLAVOR=debug deploy` -- an ordinary command -- would have done exactly that:
# `RELEASE=1` drops `devtriggers`, so it read as production, while the key still came from the local
# file and the data still went to dev. Destination and label diverging silently is the worst
# outcome for a field whose only job is to say which side data is on.
#
# The DEV pair is what a developer's machine holds; the PRODUCTION pair exists only as a GitHub
# repository variable and is injected by the release workflow. So a local build physically cannot
# reach production -- not because a flag was set, but because the value is not on the machine.
#
# All four are WRITE-ONLY ingest credentials and publishable by design -- any client that sends
# anything must carry one, and `strings` finds them in any shipped binary. The Sentry AUTH TOKEN is
# a different thing entirely (it can read and delete the project's data), is not read here, and is

# Both choices are load-bearing, and both were arrived at by measuring the failures:
#   * A rule cannot do it. macOS ships GNU make 3.81, which decides whether a target is up to date
#     from a stat taken BEFORE its prerequisites' recipes run, so a stamp written by a recipe is
#     read with its OLD mtime and the relink is skipped.
#   * A newer stamp is not enough either. make 3.81 compares mtimes at ONE-SECOND granularity, so
#     a stamp written 0.5s after the binary compares EQUAL and the link is still skipped —
#     measured: stamp 1785559259.894 vs binary 1785559259.408, no relink.
# Removing pkg/plxnative cannot be defeated by either, because "the target does not exist" is not
# a timestamp comparison. The failure this prevents is silent: you get the OTHER configuration's
# binary, with the dev counter burned into a release build or vice versa.
# (Consequence: a `make -n` that CHANGES the configuration really does delete the binary. The next
# real build restores it; a dry run that does not switch configuration touches nothing.)
#
# ...and it is skipped for a PURE QUERY. `make -s print-appdir` and friends exist so tools stop
# restating this file's values, but the block above runs at PARSE time, on every invocation,
# whatever the goal — so asking a question would delete `pkg/plxnative`, the FFmpeg header sentinel
# and the staged libraries whenever the asking invocation's configuration differed from the stamp.
# That is not hypothetical: `tools/crash-report.sh` shells out to make for the TV address, and it
# is the tool you run immediately after a crash, i.e. right after the RELEASE=1 build you were
# testing. A ~2-minute FFmpeg rebuild as the side effect of asking a question is the wrong shape,
# and worse, it would silently discard the very binary the crash is being symbolized against.
#
# The test is that EVERY goal builds nothing. A mixed `make print-appid deploy` still stamps,
# because it really is going to build something.
#
# `release-guard` is in the list beside the queries for the same reason it is not one of them: it
# is a check-only phony that produces no artifact, and it is exactly the target somebody runs to
# SEE the refusal message the cut-release skill quotes. Without it, asking that question on a
# different configuration deleted `pkg/plxnative`, the FFmpeg header sentinel and the staged
# libraries — measured, by a reviewer, mid-review.

# Codegen flags now live in rust-modules/.cargo/config.toml so they bind to the TARGET and
# every cargo invocation gets them, not just this recipe. See that file before changing them.
#
# The prerequisite list is a `find`, not a hand-kept wildcard: the crate embeds shaders
# (gfx/src/gfx.rs include_str! of gfx/src/shaders/*.vert|*.frag) and icons (ui/icons.rs include_str! of
# assets/icons/*.svg) at COMPILE time. Those were in no dependency list, so editing a shader
# or an icon produced no rebuild and the TV silently kept running the old one — the worst
# failure mode on a project whose only verification is observing the device.
# ---- The bundled FFmpeg ------------------------------------------------------
# The app ships its own FFmpeg rather than reading the television's. Why, at length, in
# ci/build-ffmpeg.sh and docs/webos5-port.md; the short version is that the TV's version moves with
# the firmware (55 -> 57 -> 58 -> 59 -> 60 across webOS 2 to 11), and while the struct OFFSETS
# could be re-derived from upstream headers at the matching version, the component list could not
# be checked at all — demuxers and bitstream filters live in a registry, as data, invisible to
# every symbol table. Bundling makes both compile-time facts.

# BOOT_SH is the close+launch dance itself, shared verbatim by `run` and `run-stream`
# so there is exactly ONE copy of the SAM incantation. It leaves the app running and
# the subscription pid in $$LP; how to observe the app is the caller's business.
#
# The two profiler JSONLs are cleared here for the same reason and under the same rule as the
# event log: they are OUTPUTS the app creates, and a root-owned leftover is one the jailed app
# cannot open — which disables the profiler with a single `Permission denied` line that is easy to
# scroll past. Clearing an output is not disarming a trigger: `make run` deliberately preserves
# `$(RUNDIR)/plxnative-*` scene triggers, including `plxnative-profile` and `plxnative-hwcnt`, so a
# profiling run is armed once and repeated.
#
# Only `rm -f` the log — never pre-create it. The app runs jailed under its own uid
# (not root), so a root-owned 644 file left in place is one the app cannot write: the
# log stays 0 bytes and every assertion reads as a total regression. `tail -F` retries
# until the app creates the file itself, which is exactly what -F is for.
#
# `fuser -k $(APPDIR)/plxnative` is INODE-scoped where `closeByAppId` is ID-scoped, and with two
# installs that difference is the point: both binaries are named `plxnative`, so a name-based kill
# (`pidof`, `killall`) would take down the OTHER install too. Keep it addressed by path.
#
# `mkdir -p` + `chmod 1777` on the runtime root before anything writes into it: two uids write here
# and neither can be made to go second — this shell is root, the app is jailed under its own uid.
# Whoever creates the directory sets its mode, and an owner-only mode locks the other out. A
# root-owned root the app cannot write means a 0-byte event log, which every tool in this repo
# reports as "no line found", i.e. exactly like a total regression. A no-op for the stable flavour,

# `make check` is now a machine-wide QUEUE, not a direct alias for the suite below. On

# is a cold 412k-line rustc build (~1 GB RSS), swap hit 9-15 GB, and one run took 60
# minutes (`cargo test --lib` build 26m33 vs. a normal ~1-2 min, hostsim build 17m37) —
# where a lone run is ~10 min. Queuing through `tools/check-lock.py`'s machine-wide
# flock (`~/.cache/plxnative/check.lock` by default, shared by every worktree) is
# strictly faster for everyone: the kernel releases the lock the moment a holder dies,
# so there is nothing to clean up by hand. `PLX_CHECK_LOCK=off` bypasses it. See
# `check-unlocked` below for the actual suite; CI runs `make check` uncontended, so the

# `make check` — the HOST unit suite plus `lint` below, the only correctness signal
# available without a television. Deliberately NOT a prerequisite of `all`: the normal build is a
# cross compile for the TV and must not be made to depend on a host toolchain run succeeding (a host
# cargo failure has nothing to do with whether the ARM staticlib is buildable, and `make deploy`
# on a machine mid-toolchain-churn should not be blocked by it). Run it before `make test`.
#
# No --target and no RUST_ENV here on purpose. Those flags exist to stop the ARM build SIGILL-ing
# on this TV's A53 (see the codegen comment above); pointed at the aarch64 host they are wrong at
# best. A bare `cargo test` builds for the host triple, which is exactly what we want — and it is
# also why this suite cannot cover anything that links the TV's own libraries: ff.rs gates its four
# `#[link]` directives out of cfg(test) so the crate's pure logic stays host-testable, and a test
# that actually calls into FFmpeg or GL fails to link by design. --lib keeps it to the crate's own
# `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks (there are no integration tests in tests/ — that directory is the
# on-device Python harness, a different thing entirely).
# NB the suite APPENDS to `/tmp/plxnative-events.log` on the dev Mac, and deliberately cannot be
# pointed elsewhere. Since 2026-08-15 enough of the tree logs its failures (stream, posters, img,
# account, remote) that host tests exercising those paths write real lines. `PLXNATIVE_RUNTIME_DIR`
# does NOT help: `paths::ENV_STEERABLE` is `cfg!(feature = "hostsim")`, off here, and widening it to
# `cfg(test)` would silently retire `paths.rs`'s own test that a television build ignores that
# variable — the suite is the only place that guarantee is ever checked. Host-side cosmetics are not
# worth a device guarantee. The television is unaffected either way (`make run` and `tests/run.py`
# both clear the log on the TV), so this is only about not confusing yourself locally.

# does not warn on a repeated condition. That dispatch lives inside the SDL event loop, so there is
# no host test for it; the lint is the whole gate. Explicitly NAMED lints, not a group: `-A
# clippy::all` first because this crate is not clippy-clean and making it so is not this gate's job,
# and naming them means a nightly bump cannot silently widen what `make check` fails on. All three
# are clean as of 2026-07-29 (so is `clippy::correctness` as a group, except ff.rs:1330's deliberate
# `loop { … break; }`). `--all-targets` so the `#[cfg(test)]` blocks are linted too, not just the
# lib. ~12s cold, <1s warm — clippy needs the nightly clippy component, which rustup's DEFAULT

# THE STABLE INSTALL IS ALWAYS A RELEASE BUILD, and that is a gate rather than a habit.
#
# `com.beb.plxnative` is the id users get. A dev-featured binary under it carries the whole
# `/tmp` trigger surface, the world-writable `plxnative-remote` FIFO and the `:8910` capture
# listener — the exact surface the `cut-release` skill's §2 exists to keep out of a shipped
# artifact, seen from the other side. Before the flavour split this could only happen by
# publishing by hand, which is how v0.2.1's defects got out; now it is one forgotten `RELEASE=1`
# on a machine that also has a television, so it gets a mechanism.
#
# The escape hatch is named rather than absent, because there is one legitimate use — reproducing a
# user's report against the shipped id with instrumentation on — and a gate with no hatch gets
# deleted rather than respected.
# A LAB BUILD IS NEVER THE STABLE ID, and it never ships without its session file.
#
# Both halves are the same argument as `release-guard`'s, one feature along. `com.beb.plxnative` is
# the id users install; a lab-featured binary under it carries an upload endpoint and a bearer
# secret, which is the one thing in this repository that must never reach a stranger's television.
# And a LAB build with no `pkg/lab.json` is inert — it boots, logs `lab: INERT`, and answers the
# button with nothing, which in a rented Cloud Test Lab hour is indistinguishable from the colour
# key not being delivered at all. Failing here names the command that fixes it.

# --- installing a flavour on the television ---------------------------------------------------
#
# `make deploy` scp's into an app directory that ALREADY EXISTS and is already registered. Creating
# a second app is a different operation: SAM has to learn the id, and the LS2 role file that lets
# the app talk to `com.webos.media.*` is written by the installer. So a flavour is installed once,
# from its own .ipk, exactly the way a user installs the real one — which is also the only path
# that exercises the package (`make deploy` never consults packageinfo.json, which is how a missing
# one hid for months; see ci/mkipk.py).
#
# AND THEN IT DEPLOYS, deliberately. appinstalld replaces `applications/<id>/` WHOLESALE — the same
# fact that keeps the session file outside it (paths.rs) — so an install wipes whatever was in
# there and leaves the PACKAGED binary behind. Ending here would leave you looking at a build you
# did not make, which is the "plausible wrong data" failure this repo cares most about.

# PlxNative.app — the same host build, packaged as a SELF-CONTAINED macOS application you can send
# to somebody who has none of this installed. `ci/mkmacapp.py` is the whole recipe and its module
# doc is the account of the three ways it silently ships broken; `docs/macos-app.md` is the design
# note (what it can and cannot do — chiefly: no video off-device).
#
# Its own target dir, per this file's rule for feature-set splits: this one is `--release
# --no-default-features --features hostsim`, which is a fourth configuration, and sharing a dir
# with `sim` would make each invocation rebuild the crate the other way round.

# `make fixtures` — SYNTHESIZE THE TEST MEDIA. Host-side, and there is NO TELEVISION anywhere in
# it: it is ffmpeg + lavfi on this Mac, writing into $(FIXTURES_OUT) (default ~/plxnative-fixtures,
# OUTSIDE the repo — tests/fixtures/make_fixtures.py refuses an --out inside it, because media must
# never be committed).
#
# What it is for: `./tests/run.py --server` grades the player against nine symbolic item SHAPES, and
# tests/manifest.local.json maps each to a ratingKey on whatever PMS you own. That mapping is the
# entire barrier to entry — the shapes include a TrueHD default with an AC-3 sibling, a Dolby
# Vision 8.1 base layer, a PGS bitmap subtitle track and an eight-track audio file with English DTS
# at ordinal 6, and two of those have no freely-licensed example anywhere. This builds all of them
# from nothing, lays them out in two Plex-scannable trees, and writes a fixtures.json saying what
# it PROVED about each file. tests/fixtures/README.md is the walkthrough, including the shapes it
# cannot solve (the three marker_* cases) and why.
#
# Deliberately NOT a prerequisite of `all` or `check`, and never run by them: this writes ~2.5 GB
# and takes ~20 minutes, which is not something a build should do because somebody typed `make`.
# `fixtures-quick` builds the same shapes at ~20 s each in about a minute — structurally correct,
# and NOT suite-valid, since every seek/resume/marker depth the suite asserts is deeper than that.

# ...and the PIPELINE tier's pack, which is a different thing for a different suite. `fixtures`
# above builds media for the INTEGRATION suite: full-length, laid out in two Plex-scannable trees,
# because those cases go through a PMS and every duration in them is a Plex constant (the ~90%
# watched threshold that drops a seeded resume point, the marker windows, the Up Next tail).
# `./tests/run.py` (the DEFAULT tier since 2026-08-22) needs none of that — it serves these files
# off this machine over HTTP
# and plays them through plxnative-playurl with no Plex anywhere — so the pack is short clips in a
# FLAT directory, ~0.7 GB and a few minutes instead of ~3 GB and twenty. Same root, its own
# subdirectory, which is also where the harness looks by default.
#
# It grew from ~0.4 GB on 2026-08-23, when the RESOLUTION x CODEC matrix landed (LG App Self
# Checklist #50/#51): six new clips at SD/HD/FHD/UHD, of which the 4K H.264 one is 93 MB on its
# own, plus a deliberately SHORT 20 s clip that exists to run out (#46). Resolution is a property
# of the media, so a matrix cell cannot be a second case on an existing file — that is the whole
# reason this is disk rather than manifest. `--only <shape>` rebuilds one.

# ...and out of THIS INSTALL's runtime root, which is where the app writes them
# (`paths::in_runtime_dir`) and where BOOT_SH clears them. It was two `/tmp` literals: at the
# default flavour the profiler wrote into `/tmp/<app id>/` while this reached for `/tmp/`, and
# because both lines are `-` prefixed the miss was swallowed — so a profiling run that produced
# exactly the data asked for reported "no profiler output on the TV".
