# rust-modules — the Rust app core

This crate's ARM build is a `staticlib` linked into the C binary (`pkg/nativejelly`). It began as a
gradual, module-by-module C→Rust migration; today it IS the app — UI, event loop, player
engine, demux pipeline, and the catalog data layer all live here (see `docs/agent-reference.md`
for the architecture). The C side boots the process, records an async-signal-safe fallback crash
line and image marker, wraps the Starfish C++ seam, and keeps Sentry's opaque value ABI on the C
side. Its Rust entry points are `nj_run`, `nj_crash_write_image_marker`,
`nj_sentry_spool_external`, and the two Starfish callbacks.

## Ported to Rust (10) — the whole data / logic / UI / render / platform stack

| module | what it is | notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `img` | image decode + GL upload | `image` crate replaces vendored stb_image.h |
| `stream` | HTTP/1.1 client | `repr(C)` `http_stream`; bounds-checked parsing |
| `aq` | access-unit FIFO | `repr(C)` + libc pthread; flexible-array node |
| `mkv` | Matroska/EBML demuxer | ~450 lines; `catch_unwind` entry points |
| `catalog_fetch` | catalog fetch/parse | `serde_json`; shared movie list |
| `posters` | async artwork store | idiomatic rewrite on `std::sync` Mutex/Condvar + threads |
| `text` | SDL2_ttf rendering | font + glyph-texture caches |
| `gfx` | GLES2 draw primitives | 3 shader programs, SDF cards, FPS digits |
| `system` | SDL/wayland platform glue | the over-allocated `SDL_SysWMinfo` buffer lives here |
| `ui_home` | home screen + navigation | reusable component seed (card/pill/circle/label) |

## Left as C by design (5)

- **`src/starfish.c`** — LG's `StarfishMediaAPIs` (the mangled C++ methods called
  via `__asm__`, an `sret` `std::string` return, a 64 KB in-place object buffer)
  plus the ACB video-plane bind. The engine that *drives* it is Rust (`player/`).
- **`src/main.c`** — the boot shim: event-log/stderr setup, process bring-up, native-crash reporter
  re-entry and the fallback image marker; it calls the Rust entry points named above and owns no
  application state.
- **`src/crashtrace.c`** — the async-signal-safe fallback fault recorder installed by the shim.
- **`src/sentry_context.c`** — a narrow string-only wrapper around Sentry's opaque, by-value
  `sentry_value_t`; Rust calls it without having to reproduce that ARM32 ABI.
- **`src/svg.c`** — the vendored nanosvg rasterizer (header-only C).

Rust *can* do the Starfish FFI (`#[link_name = "<mangled>"]` mirrors the C
`__asm__`), but it would be **all `unsafe` with zero safety gain**, high effort,
and high risk to the hardest-won feature (video on the panel). C stays the right
tool for the C++ interop.

## Build (see the Makefile for the full toolchain)

Cross-compiled (the `.a` via `cargo +nightly rustc --lib --crate-type staticlib`, with
`-Z build-std=std,panic_unwind`) for `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`; the C side and the final link use the webOS NDK
(`make setup-env`). Critical TV flags: `-C target-cpu=cortex-a9` (the default
ARMv6 codegen emits a CP15 memory barrier that SIGILLs on this SoC; cortex-a9
emits the dedicated `dmb`) and `-C target-feature=-neon`, with `-Z build-std`
rebuilding std under those flags. The Makefile owns this invocation — nothing
else should duplicate it.
