//! `net` — a small blocking HTTPS client over **whatever libcurl the machine already has**, bound
//! at runtime by the candidate list below (nothing is linked, and `stub/` — which this line named
//! for months after it was deleted — is gone). The plain-HTTP socket in [`crate::stream`] can
//! resolve names now, but it still cannot do TLS; this fills that gap. Every call is
//! **blocking**, so callers must run it off the SDL main loop (the account and PMS workers).
//!
//! **It is no longer the plex.tv transport alone**, and that line stood here while it was becoming
//! untrue. A PMS reached over the public internet is an `https://…plex.direct` origin — a NAME,
//! because that is what the certificate is issued for — so the whole PMS control plane comes
//! through here too whenever the origin is TLS. `crate::http` is the door that decides which of
//! the two transports a request takes; this module is only ever the https half of it. Direct
//! callers are `plex::account`, auth's public headerless QR-image fetch, and — since the telemetry
//! work — [`crate::telemetry::sender`], which is the first traffic in this app's history to a host
//! that is neither Plex nor the user's own server. It goes through [`post_ca`]: CA-verified,
//! unpinned, bounded sink. **This list has stood here while becoming untrue before**, which is why
//! it is worth checking rather than trusting; that is twice.
//!
//! Only the curl *easy* API is used here; [`crate::curlio`] binds the multi API separately for the
//! media plane. This module owns their shared process init, including the mutex callbacks required
//! when the TV's libcurl uses OpenSSL 1.0. The option/info integer constants are curl's stable
//! public ABI values (kept here so we do not need the header). TLS peer+host verification is ON
//! (the lab receiver's [`Tls::Pinned`] swaps it for a key pin) with ONE bounded exception on the
//! ordinary request path, [`keypin`] (issue #378): a request whose strict attempt failed with
//! a date verify result (a television with no battery clock) is repeated once, recognising the
//! server by the public key remembered for that exact host and port, with the name check still on.
//! `NOSIGNAL` is set because we call from threads. Response bodies never carry into a log here.

//
// The TV's libcurl SONAME is not stable across webOS: releases up to 6.4.0 answer to
// `libcurl.so.5`, and from 7.4.0 on only `libcurl.so.4` exists. Naming either in DT_NEEDED
// excludes half the fleet — and the exclusion is not "curl calls fail", it is the dynamic loader
// refusing to start the process. (5.3.1 and 6.4.0 carry BOTH names, a compat alias LG kept over
// the transition, which is why `.so.5` reached further than the file listing suggests.)
//
// The four setopt/getinfo wrappers share two C symbols via the macro's `= "name"` override. That
// is how the variadic API is bound: each call site passes exactly one trailing argument whose type
// is fixed by the option id, so one concrete non-variadic signature per call shape is both
// sufficient and what the compiler was already generating. This was hand-written once on the
// belief that a macro could not express it — the blocker was never the variadics, only the
// one-symbol-per-wrapper assumption.
//
// **The third name is macOS's, and it is what makes the desktop build able to SIGN IN.** The host
// simulator and the `PlxNative.app` bundle run this same module, and on a Mac the two ELF SONAMEs
// simply do not open — which is why signing in "did not work off-device" and was written up as an
// unfixable property of the simulator. It was one missing candidate: macOS ships libcurl in the
// dyld shared cache and `dlopen("libcurl.4.dylib")` resolves it with no install, no Homebrew and
// nothing to bundle (verified 2026-08-16: the handle opens and `curl_easy_setopt` resolves).
// It is LAST deliberately — a television never reaches it, so this costs the device nothing but
// one extra failed `dlopen` in the already-fatal no-curl case, and the candidate list stays
// ordered by "what the fleet actually answers to" first.

/// ([`TLS_VERIFY_FAILED`], 60, with `CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT` 9 "not yet valid" or 10

/// key is used.
///
/// **What is relaxed, when, and what still holds.** A request retries in key mode only when ALL of
/// these hold ([`after_strict_failure`]): it ran in strict mode (a CA store, never [`Tls::Pinned`],
/// never plaintext); libcurl said 60; the verify result was 9 or 10; and the table below holds a
/// key for that `host:port`. Key mode sets `CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY` to the remembered key and
/// turns `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` off — which drops the chain and date check: `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`
/// stays 2 (the certificate must still be issued for the name in the URL), the key must still match
/// (rc 90 otherwise), and [`apply`] makes the relaxation impossible without an accepted pin. A
/// failure whose verify result is anything else (an untrusted issuer reported first, 18-21; a name
/// mismatch) is refused exactly as before even when a key is held.
///
/// **What the trigger does NOT prove, stated plainly.** The security of key mode rests on the key
/// pin plus the name check, not on the date being the only defect. (1) Verify result 9/10 does not
/// show that the rest of the chain would have passed: OpenSSL stops at the first error it meets
/// walking the chain, so a certificate that is expired AND untrusted reads as 10 too. (2) Key mode
/// also engages for a genuinely expired certificate on a correct clock, because the trigger is the
/// verify result and not a judgement about the clock. (3) The remembered key has no expiry: it lasts
/// as long as the session that holds it.
///
/// **Two tables, one lifetime rule.** The key table is keyed by lowercase `host:port`, beside
/// [`resolve`]'s but with REPLACE semantics: it is a projection of the session's remembered keys
/// (`plex::session::project_server_keys`), recomputed whenever the session changes, and empty after
/// sign-out. The latch records which `host:port`s are currently being served in key mode: after a
/// fallback succeeds, later requests go straight to key mode instead of failing a strict handshake
/// first, for [`LATCH`] of monotonic time, after which strict is tried again. A strict success, a
/// pin change for the host and a key-mode pin mismatch each clear it.
///
/// A request that ran in key mode never reports a [`Resp::peer_pin`]: that handshake was not
/// strictly verified, and a key learned from it would be a stranger's remembered as the server's.
///
/// **Facts, and one toast.** Where each decision is already made this module also publishes what it
/// means, for the app to poll by [`keypin::revision`] (`plex::grant`'s shape): [`keypin::engaged`]
/// (key mode has engaged this run, with the year the device believed at the first time) and
