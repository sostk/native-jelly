//! Blocking HTTP/1.1 over a raw TCP socket (was src/stream.c). Callers
//! (posters/pms/player) allocate an `HttpStream` and pass `&hs`; this operates on it
//! in place. Header/chunk parsing is bounds-checked (no OOB).
//!
//! The host is a **name or an address literal of either family**, resolved through `getaddrinfo`
//! ([`resolve`]) and dialled down the whole returned chain ([`connect_any_result`]). It used to be
//! four decimal octets parsed by hand into a `sockaddr_in`, which made a hostname and every IPv6
//! server not "degraded" but impossible — the shape of the gap LG's checklist #43 CASE2 asks about.
//! What is still missing here is TLS: this arm stays cleartext. [`crate::http`] sends an `https://`
//! control-plane origin through [`crate::net`], while MEDIA bytes use [`crate::curlio`], a
//! libcurl-multi pull source under the same `ff.rs` AVIO that this module serves for `http`.
//!
//! Failures the legacy `0`/`-1` return cannot carry are reported to the event log instead: a
//! non-2xx response (where the code is known and the socket is about to close) and a body that came
//! up short of its `Content-Length` ([`short_body_line`]). [`http_open_until_result`] additionally
//! preserves the setup failure's typed cause for deadline-aware callers. A truncated body is still
//! handed to its caller, and no line built here carries a query string, which is [`log_endpoint`]'s
//! rule and the reason it exists.
