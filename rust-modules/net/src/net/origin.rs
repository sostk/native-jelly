//! **Where a server is, as one value: scheme + host + port.** The type every layer passes around
//! instead of a bare `(host, port)` pair.
//!
//! **This file lives in the transport and the Plex layer re-exports it.** The transport has to read
//! these values itself — [`crate::stream`]'s redirect follower walks `Origin`s hop by hop, and
//! [`crate::net`]'s request funnel asks [`url_host`] whether a name needs resolving and applies a
//! [`ResolvePin`] — and a transport that named the Plex layer for them would point UP the module
//! graph (`docs/module-layers.md`, step L6). So the address types, the URL reading and the DNS pin
//! sit here, below `plex`, which re-exports them from `plex::origin` and `plex` so no Plex caller
//! changed. What stayed in `plex::origin` is the one thing that is about Plex policy and not about
//! an address: `CredentialPolicy`.
//!
//! ## Why this type exists at all
//!
//! This app could once reach exactly one shape of server: **plaintext HTTP at a numeric IPv4
//! address**. `stream.rs` built a `sockaddr_in` out of four decimal octets and spoke cleartext, so
//! `(host, port)` was a complete description of a server, and every layer — the registry, the
//! session file, the login flow, the stream URLs — carried those two values and nothing else.
//!
//! Every half of that limit is gone, through separate transports:
//! `stream.rs` resolves through `getaddrinfo` and dials either address family, and the CONTROL
//! plane routes a TLS origin through libcurl (`crate::http` dispatches on the scheme), while the
//! MEDIA plane uses `crate::curlio` as a libcurl-multi pull source. What
//! `(host, port)` still could not say is the SCHEME, which is this type's reason for existing.
//!
//! It is not a complete description of the servers plex.tv actually advertises, and the gap is not
//! cosmetic. `plex::probe` builds ranked candidates from an account's `/api/v2/resources`, and
//! the one field that says where a candidate really is is `plex::probe::Candidate::url`
//! — **not** `Candidate::address`. plex.tv advertises the `plex.direct` HOSTNAME in `uri` while
//! `address` stays the dotted quad hiding behind it, and `probe`'s own doc says outright that
//! "https to the bare IP fails validation by design": the certificate is issued for
//! `203-0-113-9.hash.plex.direct`, so a TLS connection made to `203.0.113.9` fails hostname
//! validation however well the packets flow. An origin rebuilt from `address` therefore *looks*
//! like it speaks TLS and cannot: it is exactly the bug this type is here to make unwriteable.
//!
//! **So an `Origin` is PARSED from a URL, never assembled from an address.** [`Origin::parse`] is
//! the front door, `plex::probe::Candidate::origin` is the one that matters, and
//! [`Origin::http`] is the deliberately-named plaintext constructor — every remaining caller of
//! *that* is a place that still assumes cleartext, and `Origin::http(` is the grep that finds them.
//!
//! ## The bracket rule, which is an invariant and not a detail
//!
//! A v6 address appears in two different spellings and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! * **`getaddrinfo` takes the BARE literal** — `::1`. Hand it `[::1]` and resolution fails.
//! * **A URL takes the BRACKETED form** — `[::1]:32400`. Without the brackets the port colon is
//!   indistinguishable from an address group, and `http://::1:32400` names nothing.
//!
//! [`Origin::host`] is therefore **always unbracketed** (it is the resolver's node argument) and
//! [`Origin::authority`] is **always bracket-correct** (it is URL serialization). Anything that
//! dials calls `host()`; anything that builds a URL calls `authority()` or [`Origin::base`]. The
//! round trip `http://[::1]:32400` → `host() == "::1"` → `authority() == "[::1]:32400"` →
//! `base() == "http://[::1]:32400"` is pinned by a test, because the failure mode without it is
//! silent: URL construction keeps looking right while name resolution quietly stops working.
//!
//! ## This is a PMS origin parser, not a general URL parser
//!
//! Two deliberate narrowings, both because every origin in this app is a Plex server's:
//!
//! * **The default port is 32400**, not 80/443. It is what `StreamUrl::parse` has always defaulted
//!   to, and a PMS with no port in its URL is a PMS on the default port.
//! * **Only `http` and `https` are recognised.** [`Origin::parse`] refuses anything else rather
//!   than inventing a meaning for it.

/// Which transport an origin names. Lives here rather than in `plex::probe` because it is a
/// property of an ORIGIN; probe merely *ranks* it, and re-exports this type for that.
///
/// **Ordered best-first, and the derived `Ord` IS that preference** — `plex::probe::candidates`
/// sorts on it directly.
///
/// **The two declarations were the other way round until the TLS control plane landed**, and this
/// note is kept rather than replaced because the reversal is the whole of what changed. The old
/// order was not a claim about which transport is better; it was a claim about which one this app
/// could *dial*: the app spoke plain HTTP and nothing else, so an https `plex.direct` origin ranked
/// first would have spent the first probe slot on something that could not connect. `crate::http`
/// now routes an https origin through libcurl, and https is the better connection on every axis
/// that matters here — it is the only one a certificate can authenticate, the only one that
/// survives an owner's *Require secure connections*, and the only one that reaches a server from
/// outside its LAN at all.
///
/// `Default` is still [`Scheme::Http`] — the scheme this app has always spoken, and what a session

/// plex.tv advertises the household's OWN server as `https://192-168-0-10.<hash>.plex.direct`,
/// and that name resolves only through Plex's public wildcard zone. Discovery ranks TLS first and
/// persists the winner, so a LAN server is normally stored under that name — and on a LAN whose
/// uplink is down it can no longer be found, although it is one hop away. The plaintext twin
/// `plex::probe::candidates` synthesizes for exactly this case cannot carry a token in a store
/// build (`crate::http::credential_transport_allowed`), so the only offline route is the TLS name
/// with its address supplied locally. That is this type.
///
/// ## What is accepted, and why the rule is narrow
///
/// A pin is built ONLY for a TLS origin whose host is a dashed-address `*.plex.direct` label, and
/// only when the address that label ENCODES equals the address stored beside it — the
/// `Connection.address` plex.tv advertised, persisted as `ServerRef::address` / `SourceRef::address`.
/// The stored address is what is dialled (data copied from plex.tv, per `docs/shared-servers.md`
/// §1); the decode is the cross-check. Two consequences:
///
/// * a mismatch, an undecodable label, a plain hostname or a literal host yields `None`, and the
///   request resolves through DNS exactly as before — a wrong guess can only COST a pin, never
///   produce a wrong one;
/// * a valid pin is a pure function of the hostname, so a mapping recorded once can never become
///   stale when a registry slot re-points. That is what lets `crate::net::resolve` keep an
///   append-only table for the media plane instead of threading this value through the engine.
///
/// The IPv6 label is Plex's documented spelling — the full eight groups joined by dashes, no `::`
/// shorthand — and it is what this account's server advertises on the wire (captured 2026-09-05
/// alongside the v4 form). An abbreviated fixture such as `2001-db8--1` is therefore not a label
