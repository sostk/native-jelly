//! Motion arithmetic the logical state can DEPEND on (spec §4.2): the spring integrators, with
//! their own pure-Rust `exp` and `sin_cos` (range-reduced polynomials, pinned bit for bit), so
//! that everything a machine hashes is IEEE `+ − × ÷ √` plus two functions whose every bit this
//! crate decides. Everything else on the platform libm (`f32::exp`, `sin_cos`) is fine for
//! pixels and refused for state by the `check-deps` libm gate.
//!
//! Two assumptions are STATED and CHECKED rather than assumed: rustc does not contract into FMA
//! without a flag (the grep gate on `fp-contract`/`fast-math`/`+fma`), and the armv7 soft-float
//! routines are correctly rounded for the five operations — which is what
//! [`differential_table`] exists to measure: the same 4,096 operands through the same code on
//! the host and on the television (`make softfloat-probe`, the `nativejelly-softfloat` trigger),
//! compared as one hash. The host half is pinned here, and **the ARM half was measured on the
//! television on 2026-09-07 (TV session 3, phase 5b) and MATCHES BIT FOR BIT**:
//! `softfloat: n=4096 hash=0x65a8e905a259246d host=0x65a8e905a259246d MATCH`, on webOS 4.5 /
//! Cortex-A9 against the same 4,096 operands. So the spec's cross-target GOAL (§4.2, §5.5) is met
//! for these five operations on this target, and the phase-5b fixtures need no target scoping.
//!
//! **What that does and does not license.** It is one measurement on ONE firmware and one CPU, not
//! a proof about armv7 soft-float in general, and it says nothing about a target this project does
//! not build for. It is also not a licence to widen the same-build promise of §5.5: a replay
//! fixture is still pinned to the build lineage that recorded it, and this result only removes the
//! ARITHMETIC as a suspect when a cross-target replay does diverge. Re-run
//! `make softfloat-probe` after any toolchain or `-C target-cpu` change — those are the inputs
//! that would move it, and nothing in `make check` can see them. If it ever diverges, the fixture
//! is target-scoped and the divergence named rather than the promise widened.
//!
//! Domain: the springs feed `exp` with `-ω·dt ∈ [-2, 0]` and `sin_cos` with `ω_d·dt ∈ [0, 2]`;
//! both functions are correct well beyond that (`exp` over the whole finite range, `sin_cos` to
//! |x| ≈ 1e4 with three-part Cody-Waite reduction) and say what they do past it.
