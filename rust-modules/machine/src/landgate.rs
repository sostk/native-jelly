//! **The landing schedule** (restructure spec §3.3 step 3, §5.5): during REPLAY, a live result
//! is delivered on the frame the recording delivered it on, not on whichever frame the worker
//! thread happened to finish.
//!
//! §3.3 step 3 says adapter results are keyed by `(completion_frame, adapter_rank,
//! arrival_index)` and that `completion_frame` is "recorded, so thread scheduling is
//! irrelevant". Nothing enforced that half: the stores that land OUTSIDE the dispatcher's drain
//! (`stores::metadata::pump_detail` and its siblings, `person`, `viewstate`, `browse`, `search`,
//! and Home's hubs through `bridge::take_live_results`) poll their own mailboxes every frame, so
//! the frame a landing was OBSERVED on was whatever the network and the scheduler produced.
//! Measured 2026-09-10: the one recorded `async` record of flow 12 sat on frame 1 in the
//! recording and on frame 0 in every replay, and because a spring started one frame earlier
//! never re-converges bit for bit, 927 of 928 frames diverged.
//!
//! **The mechanism, in one sentence:** a landing SITE asks this module before it consumes its
//! mailbox, and while the store's next recorded landing frame is still in the future the answer
//! is "not yet" and the record stays where it is.
//!
//! * A landing that arrives EARLY waits — it is consumed on its recorded frame instead.
//! * On the frame a landing is DUE, the site polls its mailbox for a bounded moment
//!   ([`WAIT_POLLS`]) before giving up, because a worker that was fast enough when the recording
//!   was taken can be a frame slower here. Holding alone fixes only one of the two directions,
//!   and the other is a coin flip: measured on flow 12 with the hold alone, Metadata landed a
//!   frame late and Person two, and every frame after that diverged.
//! * A landing that is still not there when the budget is spent is delivered whenever it does
//!   arrive and counted as `late` — that is the pre-phase-11 behaviour, kept as the fallback.
//! * A landing the recording never saw at all is delivered at once and counted as `extra`.
//! * A recorded landing that never arrives is counted as `missing` when the replay ends.
//!
//! **The wait is REPLAY-ONLY, bounded and taken at most once per (frame, owner, store)**, so a store
//! whose landing is due at a site that will not produce it cannot spend the budget twice on one
//! frame. It is a stop-gap for one specific reason, worth saying plainly: the honest end state is
//! §5.5's closed replay, where the recorded payload is INJECTED and no fetch happens at all. That
//! needs every store's result codec and its client bindings, which this lane does not build; until
//! it exists, a replay's stores fetch live and this is what keeps their frames comparable.
//!
//! Each [`Gate`] belongs to one `Stores` owner, and is keyed per STORE ORDINAL inside that owner:
//! the schedule is that store's `(frame, count)` pairs, and every arrival at any of its sites
//! consumes one unit. The COUNT is load-bearing and a boolean was
//! measured wrong first — `person` has one mailbox per fetch and took four answers over four
//! frames when the recording was made and over three when it was replayed, so a per-frame boolean
//! let one replay frame consume two arrivals for one cursor step, after which every later landing
//! of that store read as `late` for the rest of the run. With counts the second arrival on a
//! frame whose unit is spent is simply HELD to the next recorded frame, which is where it was.
//!
//! **It is a hold, never a spawn barrier.** The gate wraps the mailbox take alone, so the pumps'
//! other halves — the retry countdowns, `maybe_spawn`, the debounce, the roster sync — run on
//! their recorded frames exactly as they did. Gating a whole `pump()` would have suppressed the
//! spawn that produces the very landing being waited for.
//!
//! **Cost outside a recording or a replay is one relaxed `AtomicBool` load** (`Gate`'s armed flag): the
//! helpers return the closure's own answer and never take the lock.
