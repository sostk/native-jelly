//! **Whole-frame present gating** — "nothing on screen changed, so don't repaint it".
//!
//! This is *not* the dirty-rectangle tracking [`mod.rs`](super)'s renderer doc rejects, and the
//! distinction is the whole reason this module is allowed to exist. That rule is about what
//! happens *inside* a frame: the renderer stays immediate-mode, every frame still clears and
//! rebuilds the entire view tree, and the way to not draw something is still to CULL it. This
//! module only decides whether to run that frame **at all**. When it says yes, nothing below it
//! changes; when it says no, the loop skips `glViewport`…`SDL_GL_SwapWindow` wholesale. No screen,
//! widget or painter learns anything new, and nothing tracks sub-frame damage.
//!
//! # Why it is worth having
//!
//! Measured on the device (2026-07-31, 60 s windows, `/proc` jiffy deltas): a **still** Home grid
//! cost 16.0% of one Cortex-A53 core in this process — and, because the compositor must blend our
//! 1080p surface every time we present, another ~19.4 points inside `surface-manager` (23.8% with
//! us up vs 4.4% with the app closed). That second charge is **content-independent** — it measured
//! the same on the flat profile picker, the Home grid and the hero billboard — so it is a per-
//! *present* charge, not a per-pixel one. Roughly 35 points of one core, indefinitely, to re-send
//! a picture that has not changed. A TV sits on Home for hours and the SoC is fan-less.
//!
//! # The model: exact motion, plus explicit invalidation
//!
//! Two independent signals, deliberately not one heuristic:
//!
//! 1. **Motion is detected exactly, not guessed.** Every animation in the app runs through
//!    [`gfx::spring`](crate::gfx::spring) or [`gfx::spring_zeta`](crate::gfx::spring_zeta) — those
//!    two functions are the only spring integrators there are — so they call [`note_spring`] and
//!    the gate *knows* whether any of the ~439 springs a settled Home grid steps per frame is
//!    still in flight. There is no settle-window guess to tune, and no animation can be truncated
//!    mid-flight by a timer that expired early.
//!
//! 2. **Discrete changes call [`invalidate`].** A spring is not involved when a poster texture
//!    lands, a hub refetch commits, or a keypress swaps a label. Those sites say so explicitly.
//!    The full set is listed on [`invalidate`]; adding a new async landing means adding a call
//!    there, and the [`KEEPALIVE_MS`] backstop below bounds the damage if someone forgets.
//!
//! **Springs are not the only clock, and that is the standing hazard.** Anything that animates
//! from raw time — a millisecond ramp, a phase accumulator, a countdown — is invisible to (1) by
//! construction and must report through (2) itself. Two did not, and both froze in the product:
//! [`Xfade`](crate::ui::xfade) (every CONTENT cross-fade — the Library's grid and page, Search's
//! results, Filmography's preview) and [`Spinner`](crate::ui::widgets::Spinner)
//! (every loading read-out). They report from their own advance and draw respectively; the reasons
//! those two sides differ are on each call. `Xfade` was the ROUTE dip too until restructure phase
//! 12 (D1) lifted that onto [`PageDip`](crate::ui::containers::transition::PageDip), which is
//! inside the container and reports `Motion` from its own `tick` by construction. `docs/retui-invalidation-design.md` is the accepted
//! plan for closing the class properly, by making `dt` a capability rather than an `f32`.
//!
//! The asymmetry is deliberate: a false "something moved" costs one wasted frame, a false
//! "nothing moved" freezes the screen. Both the rest threshold and the backstop are therefore
//! biased toward presenting.
//!
//! # What this module does NOT do
//!
//! It does not slow the **loop** — only the **present**. Input polling, the remote FIFO drain,
//! `ls2_pump`, `route::pump_play`, `metadata::pump_detail`, `app::adapters::poster::prepare` and every
//! screen's `*_update` keep running at full rate, so key latency is unchanged, timers still fire
//! (the hero billboard's 8 s auto-flip still flips), and async work still lands on schedule. Those
//! cost ~0.3% of a core between them; the 16% was the draw.
//!
//! It is also **not applied while the hardware video plane is bound** — see [`VIDEO_PLANE`],
//! [`note`] and `Player::video_plane_bound` below, fed by `Player::set_video_plane_bound`'s edges
//! rather than by which route is on screen. A pre-bind spinner or a post-unbind failure read-out
//! is an ordinary idle-gated frame; "we stop presenting for seconds while a plane is bound to our
//! surface" is a claim about this compositor that no amount of reading settles. Home never binds
//! the plane, which is what makes it the safe place to prove the mechanism.

/// A spring is in flight while the value it will DRAW this frame differs **visibly** from the one
/// it drew last frame. Two terms, and the second one is where the cost was.
///
/// The first version of this module used one absolute `1e-3` for both the distance and the
/// velocity, on the argument that 1e-3 is invisible whether the spring is in pixels or in 0..1.
/// That is true of the DISTANCE term and false of the VELOCITY term, because velocity is in units
/// **per second**: `1e-3` on a pixel-valued spring means "still moving at a thousandth of a pixel
/// per second", which a critically-damped spring satisfies for a very long time after it has
/// visually arrived. Simulated against the real constants, that tail was **36–52% of every
/// interaction's presents** — 43 of the 83 frames a 280 px shelf scroll costs, all of them
/// sub-pixel. Those are whole presents, so each one also carried the compositor's per-present
/// charge, which is the larger half.
///
/// So: scale the threshold to the spring's own magnitude (`REST_REL`), cap it below one pixel so a
/// large-magnitude spring can never stop somewhere visible (`REST_CAP`), and compare **velocity
/// times dt** — the distance this frame — rather than velocity itself.
///
