//! What this television can DECODE — the device's own codec table, read once at boot.
//!
//! # Why the app asks the device instead of knowing
//!
//! The capability profile used to be a set of constants describing the author's television: HEVC
//! yes, 4K yes, AAC/AC3/EAC3 yes. Every one of those claims is true on the 49SM9000PLA and was
//! asserted to every server as if it were true of webOS. That is the bug class issue #22 named
//! and `docs/plex-pass-audit.md` enumerates — **a claim true on the development environment,
//! asserted as universal** — and the decode-capability assertion was its last standing member
//! (the audit's closing section): a webOS set whose SoC lacks HEVC would be offered, and would
//! direct-play, streams it cannot decode, and nothing here could catch it because the only
//! device this project owns decodes everything the constants claimed.
//!
//! # Where it comes from
//!
//! `/etc/umediaserver/device_codec_capability_config.json` — published by the platform for its
//! own media stack, verified present on the dev set (webOS 4.5): per-codec rows with max
//! width/height/framerate/bitrate for video, channel counts for audio. Read once at boot, the
//! same shape as `webos::probe` (one file read, can never fail the boot, loud line either way).
//!
//! Two facts about the table shape the parse:
//!
//! * **Duplicate names are one codec.** The dev set lists BOTH `"H.265"` (4096x2304@120) and
//!   `"HEVC"` (4096x2176@60) — same decoder, two rows, different numbers. Rows naming the same
//!   codec are merged by MIN on every axis we consume, because over-claiming is the exact
//!   failure mode this module exists to end.
//! * **It cannot express bit depth.** No row carries one, so the profile's `bitDepth=10` claim
//!   stays the constant it always was (see `plex/transcoder.rs::profile_for`) — the table can
//!   neither confirm nor deny it.
//!
//! Parsed with serde_json (already a dependency of the plex layer) rather than `webos.rs`'s
//! hand scanner: this file is nested arrays of objects, not a flat string map. Any parse
//! failure — or a shape we misread — lands on [`Caps::assumed`], never on a refused boot.
//!
//! # The fallback is the old behavior, verbatim
//!
//! When the file is unreadable or unparseable, [`Caps::assumed`] restores EXACTLY the constants
//! that shipped before this module existed — the 49SM9000PLA values, the only set ever measured
//! before this module. Misreading the table must degrade to yesterday's behavior, not invent a
//! weaker television: the issue-#22 lesson cuts both ways, and a client that suddenly transcodes
//! everything on a healthy 4K panel is as wrong as one that direct-plays HEVC to a SoC without it.
