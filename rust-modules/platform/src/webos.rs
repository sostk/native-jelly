//! Which webOS this television actually is, the cached playback capabilities it reports
//! ([`caps`]), and the request which hands the screen back ([`go_home`]).
//!
//! # Why the app needs to know, when it never did before
//!
//! Until now the only thing it asked was "does `libAcbAPI` exist" (`starfish.c`'s `vp_mode`), which
//! splits the world at exactly webOS 5.0 and nowhere else. That was enough while 4.x was the only
//! target. It is not enough now: Kodi — which plays video on 5, 6 and 10 — carries gates at
//! `>= 6` (audio re-setup) and `< 11` / `>= 11` (a seek fallback, a changed signature), and with a
//! single boolean those are literally inexpressible here.
//!
//! The more immediate value is smaller and worth more: **a bug report from hardware nobody here
//! owns currently cannot say which firmware it came from.** The webOS 6/10 playback failure was
//! reported as one thing and is probably two, and the logs could not tell them apart.
//!
//! # Where it comes from
//!
//! `/var/run/nyx/os_info.json`, read once, at boot. Kodi asks
//! `luna://com.webos.service.config/getConfigs` for `tv.nyx.platformCode`; this is the same
//! information from the file nyx writes, and it needs no LS2 client, no subscription and no
//! thread. Verified present on the dev set (webOS 4.5), which reports:
//!
//! ```text
//! "webos_release": "4.10.2",  "webos_release_codename": "goldilocks2-grampians"
//! ```
//!
//! The CODENAME is the more useful half and is why this reads the file rather than a version
//! service: webosbrew's own compatibility data buckets firmware by codename, one library set per
//! bucket (their `library-version` guide — `goldilocks` is 4.0~4.4, `goldilocks2` 4.5~4.10). So
//! logging it says which of THEIR buckets a report belongs to, not just a number.
//!
//! Parsed by hand because this is a flat object of string values and a parser that cannot fail is
//! the right shape for something that must never keep the app from booting. This is not a pattern
//! for service replies: [`caps`] uses `serde_json` and strict types because uncertainty there is a
//! playback-safety decision. The capability query deliberately does not fill a missing webOS
//! version; no public version key or anonymous permission for one is evidenced.

/// `back_at_root`. It is NOT a quit: the process stays alive, webOS backgrounds it (`0x103`/`0x104`
/// reach the SDL loop, and `0x105`/`0x106` when the launcher tile brings it back), and the app
/// comes back as the SAME LIVE PROCESS. Not necessarily to the same picture, and not necessarily to

/// completed and routed on, and one this press had to restart (`app.rs::after_cancel`) shows a
/// fresh QR by design. The contract is the process, and everything else is whatever the app would
/// have been doing had nobody pressed anything.
///
/// # Why this is the platform's answer and not ours
///
/// LG's own back-button guide states the behaviour the platform performs when BACK is pressed at
/// an app's entry page: *"a popup asking whether to exit the app is displayed on webOS TV 6.0 or
/// higher, or the **Home launcher is launched** on webOS TV 5.0 or lower"*
/// (<https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/guides/back-button>, LG vendor documentation — it
/// describes the WEB runtime's `webOS.platformBack()`, which a native app cannot call, but it is
/// LG stating what the ROOT press means on this platform). The dev set is 4.10.2, so "launch the
/// Home launcher" is the behaviour to reproduce, and the app's previous "Exit PlxNative?" question
/// was the webOS 6+ shape applied to a webOS 4 television — and it quit, which even there is only
/// one of the two answers.
///
/// # The two mechanisms, in the order they are tried
///
/// 1. **SAM.** `luna://com.webos.applicationManager/launch` with the launcher's id. Same service
///    and method this repo already drives against this television from the Makefile and
///    `tools/tv-session.sh` (`launch`, `closeByAppId`), so the bus, the method and the payload
///    shape are device-proven; only the id is new. **Device-verified 2026-09-04 (webOS 4.10.2):**
///    `SAM accepted in 16ms`, and the launcher comes up as the RIBBON over the app — the app stays
///    on screen behind it, keeps drawing, keeps its pid, receives NO `LIFECYCLE: background`, and a
///    SAM `launch` of the app's own id brings it back with no ribbon. That is what the HOME key
///    does on this firmware, so it is the behaviour; this doc used to say launching Home
///    "backgrounds us", which is the webOS 5+ full-screen launcher's shape and not this set's. It
///    took a plain anonymous `LSRegister` to get there — [`ls2`]'s module doc has the table of
///    what the hub answers to each registration shape.
/// 2. **Minimize the surface.** `SDL_MinimizeWindow`, which on LG's SDL fork reaches the webOS
///    shell. The fork does bind that protocol: the harvested `libSDL2-2.0.so.0.4.1` off this set
///    carries `wl_webos_shell`, `wl_webos_shell_interface` and `wl_webos_shell_surface_interface`
///    in `.rodata`, and it is how `SDL_WEBOS_ACCESS_POLICY_KEYS_BACK` (set by `src/main.c`) becomes
///    the surface property that lets BACK reach this app at all. `wl_webos_shell_surface.set_state`
///    with `WL_WEBOS_SHELL_SURFACE_STATE_MINIMIZED = 1` is LG's own protocol
///    (`wayland-webos-shell-client-protocol.h` / `webos-shell.xml` in the NDK sysroot), and it is
///    what Kodi's webOS port drives from its `SetMinimized`. What is NOT proven from the binary is
///    that LG's fork wires `SDL_MinimizeWindow` to it — the library is stripped and the driver's
///    hook is an internal function pointer — so this is the FALLBACK and not the mechanism: SDL's
///    own contract makes an unimplemented hook a silent no-op, which is the correct failure here.
///
/// If BOTH legs fail the user stays exactly where they were, which is the right last resort: the
/// alternative is ending the process, and "must not terminate the application" is the whole of what
/// was asked for. `SDL_MinimizeWindow` returns void, so the app cannot even know the second leg
/// failed — the log line says what was ASKED, never that it worked, and the screenshot is what
/// says whether it did.
///
/// `/tmp/nativejelly-gohome=<sam|minimize>` forces one leg, so both can be exercised in one device
/// session instead of only whichever happens to answer first. Compiled out under `RELEASE=1`.
///

/// | `LSRegisterApplicationService(app_id, app_id)` | `-1028 Attempted to register for a service name that already exists` — this PROCESS already holds the app id: `ls-monitor -l` lists it beside an anonymous client, both ours, from boot; ACB is the one component handed the app id (`AcbAPI_initialize`, `player::acb_init` at boot) |
/// | `LSRegisterApplicationService(NULL, app_id)` | `-1027 Invalid permissions for (null)` — the `""` name has no permissions entry |
/// | **`LSRegister(NULL)`** | registered, and `com.webos.applicationManager/getForegroundAppInfo` answered it |
///
/// So every caller registers as a plain anonymous client, [`register`]. The role file still
/// decides what such a client may CALL — the probe proves SAM's read-only method; `launch_home`
/// grades the reply of the one that matters — and the hub's refusal, when there is one, travels
