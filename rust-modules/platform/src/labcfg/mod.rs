//! **The Lab Diagnostics configuration, and the two questions the lower layers ask of it.**
//!
//! The application's `lab` module is the bridge itself — the ring, the upload, the command long-poll, the toast —
//! and it names the whole application, so it lives in the top layer. Two of its answers are needed
//! far below that: `ui::consts::is_bound` has to know whether a press is the configured trigger,
//! and the account menu and the player overflow have to know whether to show the *Send
//! diagnostics* row. Both are functions of one thing, `lab.json`, whose reader names nothing above
//! `nj_base::paths`. That reader and those two answers are therefore here, in `platform`, beside
//! the other things this television keeps (`webos`, `devcaps`, `keymanager`); the application's
//! `lab` module reads the same `config` from above.
//!
//! The gating is exactly what it was under `lab`: without the `lab-diagnostics` cargo feature the
//! reader is not compiled at all, and both answers below are constant `false` at compile time, so
//! the call sites in `ui/` and `screens/` carry no `#[cfg]` of their own.
