//! `lab.json` — the per-session configuration, read once from the **app directory**.
//!
//! # Why the app directory and not `/tmp`
//!
//! Every other knob in this app arrives as a `/tmp/nativejelly-*` trigger written over ssh, and on a
//! Cloud Test Lab set there is no ssh: the **.ipk is the only channel into the device**. So the
//! session's endpoint, secret and certificate pin are staged into the package beside the binary
//! (`make LAB=1 … ipk`, `ci/mkipk.py`) and resolved here through [`nj_base::paths::in_app_dir`] — the
//! same `/proc/self/exe` resolution everything else in this app uses, so it is correct under both
//! install prefixes and both jail profiles.
//!
//! One consequence worth stating: a session change is a **repack**, not a rebuild. The file is
//! data, nothing about it reaches codegen, and `pkg/lab.json` is gitignored and listed in
//! `.claude/hooks/outbound-guard.py`'s `PRIVATE_FILES` because it holds a live secret.
//!
//! # Why the trigger codes are configuration
//!
//! **The codes ARE known now** — BLUE is `wcode` **489** (486 RED / 487 GREEN / 488 YELLOW,
//! `sym` 0), measured on the dev set 2026-08-26 and recorded in `docs/remote-keys.md` §9. The
//! trigger is a LIST in this file anyway, for two reasons that outlived the measurement.
//!
//! **One: the offline answer was WRONG, not merely missing.** The fork's evdev→scancode table maps
//! `KEY_RED`/`KEY_YELLOW`/`KEY_BLUE` (evdev 398/400/401) to nothing at all, and `KEY_GREEN` (399)
//! to a scancode 504 that this remote never sends — so the one colour key that looked derivable
//! from a desk was derivable incorrectly. The real codes come from LG's private evdev range
//! (289–292), which no table could have singled out.
//!
//! **Two: that is one remote on one firmware.** A Cloud Test Lab set may spell the buttons
//! differently, or its virtual remote may not offer them at all — which is why the account-menu
//! row reaches the same upload with the D-pad alone. And the app logs every press's raw bytes
//! unconditionally, so the first successful upload by any route re-answers the question for
//! whatever set it came from. `docs/lab-diagnostics.md` §7 is the full account.
