//! Remote-control channel (dev / on-device testing): a FIFO the event loop drains
//! once per frame, so a key token written from another machine — `echo down >
//! /tmp/nativejelly-remote` over SSH — drives the UI exactly like the physical remote.
//!
//! Why in-app instead of injecting system input: on this webOS 4.5 build the wayland
//! compositor (`surface-manager`) opens a FIXED set of evdev nodes at boot (the RCU /
//! Magic-Remote devices) and does not pick up hotplugged or `uinput` devices, so an
//! external virtual keyboard never reaches our SDL surface; and LG's
//! `com.webos.service.tv.keymanager/createKeyEvent` injects into the webOS web-app key
//! layer, not the wayland path we read. The reliable path is therefore in-app: read a
//! token here, and let `app.rs` synthesize the SDL key event so the ONE real key
//! handler runs unchanged. This mirrors the existing `/tmp/nativejelly-*` dev-trigger
//! design; `tools/stream-screen.py` is the host-side driver. Boot-neutral: the FIFO is
//! excluded from `automated_boot`, so its presence never changes the boot flow.
