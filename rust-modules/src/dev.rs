//! The `/tmp` developer-trigger surface, behind one door.
//!
//! This app is driven headlessly by ~44 files under `/tmp/nativejelly-*`: which screen to boot to,
//! which item to play, which URL to stream, whether to auto-press OK, which PMS token to use.
//! That is how `tests/run.py` and every capture scene work, and it is not going away.
//!
//! It must not exist in a public build. `/tmp` is the SHARED system `/tmp` in the production jail
//! too (mode 1777, both jail profiles), so on an ordinary user's TV every one of those files is a
//! behaviour switch any co-resident process can throw. Three are outright takeovers:
//! `nativejelly-token` beats the signed-in session (`app.rs`'s boot gate), `nativejelly-servers` hands
//! the app a whole additional server — an address AND the token to trust it with (see [`servers`])
//! — and `nativejelly-url` replaces the stream the player feeds.
//!
//! So every read goes through [`nj_base::devtrig`] — the primitives (`flag`, `read`, `latched_flag!`,
//! `read_sample`, `no_wan`, …), a base-layer module no application type can leak into — and that
//! door is `#[cfg]`-gated on the `devtriggers` feature. In a `--no-default-features` build
//! `devtrig::flag` is `false` and `devtrig::read` is `None` at COMPILE time, so no trigger can be
//! armed. Storage and diagnostics still use runtime files; none are developer triggers. THIS
//! module is the application-layer half: the typed triggers only app code consumes, the directory
//! scans ([`any_trigger_present`], [`armed_triggers`]) and the one-shot boot instruments.
//!
//! That does NOT keep a trigger's NAME out of the binary. A branch behind `flag`/`read` usually
//! folds away, but not reliably: once the answer is carried through a struct field (the
//! `nobudget` flag on `DevFlags`), the optimizer may keep the branch and its string literals
//! in a release build, and `ci/check-package.py` fails the package because it greps the shipped
//! bytes for every trigger name this module's [`DIAG`] and `devtrig`'s `CONTROLLED` list. So every
//! statement whose literal names a trigger (a log line saying `/tmp/nativejelly-…`) carries its own
//! `#[cfg(feature = "devtriggers")]`. Never rely on constant folding for this.
//!
//! Two rules for anything added later:
//!
//! 1. **Never open a `/tmp` path directly.** Read through `nj_base::devtrig`. The grep that audits
//!    this (`/tmp/nativejelly-` outside this module and the unconditional log sinks) is the only
//!    thing keeping the property true. The two profiler logs are dev-only and listed in [`DIAG`]
//!    below.
//! 2. **A gate is not always a path.** `any_trigger_present` scans the whole directory and names
//!    no file at all — it was the one surface a literal-replacement sweep would have missed, and
//!    it silently changes which screen the app boots to. Structural surfaces that take no name
//!    (the capture listener's `INADDR_ANY` socket, the remote FIFO's `mkfifo`) are gated at their
//!    call sites in `app.rs` for the same reason.
//!
//! The unconditional LOG sinks are deliberately NOT here and stay in every build: they are creates, not
//! reads, they are how on-device crash triage works at all, and writing them is not a way for
//! another process to steer this one.
//!
//! **Since UI restructure phase 10, [`scenarios`] is where a read gets ACTED on.** Both modules
//! reach `/tmp` only through the one door, [`nj_base::devtrig`] (`flag`/`read`); `dev::scenarios`
//! gathers every ARM — the app-core code that calls through this door and reacts — that used to be scattered
//! across `app/boot.rs`, `app/run.rs`, `app/content.rs` and `app/mod.rs`, plus the per-arm state
//! (oscillator phases, retry latches) those arms used to keep on `App` itself. Read that module's
//! doc before adding a new trigger that `app/` consumes.
