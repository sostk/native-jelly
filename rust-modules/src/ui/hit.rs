//! The hit map (restructure spec §7.5, §7.6), owned by `Input` and DOUBLE-BUFFERED: the draw
//! fills the back map through `DrawFrame::stop` (rects already in screen space, the cascade's
//! translate, pop and clip folded in — painter order IS z), the swap happens only on a PRESENTED
//! frame, and a non-drawn frame resolves against the previous map. Resolution is `top_at(x, y)`
//! — the LAST stop whose visible part (`rect ∩ clip`) contains the point — and a miss is the
//! `ModalStack`'s to answer.
//!
//! The pointer policies live on the STOP (`hover`, `activate`); the gates live here. There are
//! two, and **only the first of them is wired to the product today**:
//!
//! * `dpad_mode` suppresses hover until the pointer has travelled `DPAD_TRAVEL_PX` since the last
//!   D-pad press. Live: `Dispatcher`'s ingest calls [`HitMap::note_dpad`] on every direction key.
//! * `suppressed` is the fading-surface gate — below an alpha threshold a surface should answer
//!   no hover and no click at all. **The mechanism exists and nothing sets it**: outside this
//!   module's own unit test, `suppressed` is written nowhere, because no container feeds a
//!   surface's `Opening`/`Closing` phase or its appear-spring alpha into the map. This paragraph
//!   used to state the gate as a fact, which is how it went unnoticed — the honest reading is
//!   that a click during a surface's ~0.5 s dismissal fade still resolves against the stops that
//!   were registered on the last presented frame.
//!
//! Screens that must not be clickable through their own fade therefore have to say so themselves
//! for now — `screens/consent.rs` gates its commit arms on `DecisionAlert::visible()` rather than
//! `is_open()` for exactly this reason, and says so at each guard. Wiring the container phase in
//! here would let those screens drop that defence; it is a library change with a blast radius
//! across every surface, so it belongs to the phase that owns the hit map's remaining work
//! (spec §7.5-§7.6) rather than to the screen migration that found it (2026-09-07).
