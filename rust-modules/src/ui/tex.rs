//! `TexCache<K>` — the library's RENDER-RESOURCE half of image caching (spec §10). It owns GL
//! texture residency and the LRU, `resolve`/`resolve_wh`, `warm`, the upload step under
//! `Budget`'s `Poster` class, and one `Provenance::Resource` invalidate when a texture becomes
//! resident. It never knows what a key denotes: the application's source half
//! (`app/adapters/poster.rs`, phase 3a — interning, the transcode URL, fetch + decode workers,
//! the disk tier) delivers a decoded image as `PosterReady` and the seam is the KEY.
//!
//! **The result handler only ACCEPTS** (`accept`: owned pixels into the pending queue, no GL).
//! **Upload happens in PREPARE** (`prepare`: §3.3 step 9, after `glViewport`, inside the
//! presented frame's GL scope, one `Budget::take` per upload, `warm` on each). A frame that does
//! not present uploads nothing and the queue waits — and it does not wait long, because
//! `note_queued` publishes the queue to the budget before the present decision reads it, so
//! pending work is itself a reason to present. The class of a take is chosen by the decoded byte
//! size ([`RESIDENCY_BYTES`]): a poster is a `Poster` take, a backdrop or a hero logo a
//! `Residency` one, which takes a frame to itself. The pixels are an owned render resource handed
//! over once: they never enter logical state, and the recorder writes only `(key, ok)`.
//!
//! **Residency is bounded by BYTES, not only by the [`CACHE_CAP`] slot count.** The source's 64
//! `Pslot`s cap how many DISTINCT items the cache can be asked to hold, but a poster (≈375 KB), a
//! hero logo (≈1.44 MB) and a backdrop (≈3.7 MB) are not the same weight, so a cache holding 64
//! slots of the heavier two costs tens of megabytes more than 64 posters — ordinary browsing (ten
//! detail pages, each warming a backdrop and a logo, then a shelf of posters) reached ≈68 MB
//! resident with slots still free, which breached `RenderSet` rule (c) (§8.3,
//! `ui/frame/render_set.rs`) on every `make sim` debug build while a release build only logged.
//! [`TEX_RESIDENT_BYTES_MAX`] is the second, independent ceiling `evict_for` enforces: LRU by
//! `last_used`, oldest first, exactly as the count cap already did — the two ceilings share one
//! eviction loop and either can fire first — **but LRU alone is not the whole policy**: see the
//! next paragraph.
//!
//! **On-screen art stays; arrivals lose.** `resolve` stamps each [`Entry`] with the draw-frame
//! serial it was resolved on ([`TexCache::frame`], advanced once per [`prepare`] call, always
//! before that frame's draw). `evict_for` will not evict an entry drawn in the current or the
//! last completed frame, nor `protect` (a key being re-uploaded in place); if evicting every
//! OTHER eligible entry still would not make room, the incoming upload is REJECTED instead: a
//! brand-new key's pixels are dropped and the key joins [`TexCache::unresident`] as a REFUSAL
//! (`app/adapters/poster.rs`'s `RESIDENCY_LOST`/`RESIDENCY_REFUSED` split counts this apart from a
//! genuine loss), so the source parks it with its existing cooldown instead of the tile cycling
//! with its row sibling forever (device log: `posters: residency lost=` climbing on an idle
//! screen; the `poster-gate` eviction scenario failing `reason=target-or-art`). An image bigger
//! than the whole budget, with no on-screen art in the way, is still admitted: sheer size never
//! loses, only on-screen art does. This mirrors the glyph cache's own hot window (`text.rs`, phase
//! 11) — each keeps its OWN frame serial, advanced at its own use point, rather than a cache
//! reaching across the crate for another's clock.
