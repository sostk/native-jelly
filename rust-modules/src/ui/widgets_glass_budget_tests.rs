/// **[`GLASS_TRACK_MAX`] is the budget, solved for width** — asserted rather than asserted-in-a-
/// comment, because the two numbers live in different files and the one that moves is the
/// budget. A glass surface is charged for the blurred RECTANGLE: itself grown
/// [`nj_gfx::gfx::BLUR_MARGIN`] on every side. At the limit width that must still fit
/// [`nj_gfx::gfx::GLASS_REGION_BUDGET`], which is what a MOVING host carries at 60 fps — and this
/// bar's host is always moving, since the page under it is what the user is scrolling.
///
/// **It is priced as the PAIR now**, and that is the change worth reading twice. This asserted
/// the track alone against the budget, which was the whole story while the track was the only
/// glass in the band; [`profile_chip_with`]'s capsule is a second surface of the same material, and
/// two glass surfaces in one frame converge on ONE grab (`gfx::blur_region_union`) that has to
/// span both. A track that passes on its own and fails as a pair is exactly the regression this
/// exists to catch, so the counterexample moved with it: the old one was a 1050-wide track,
/// which is far outside either limit, where 940 — the width the TRACK alone could afford — is
/// inside its own budget and outside the band's. That is the boundary the second surface moved.
/// [`BAND_REGION_BUDGET`] is a restatement of a `cfg(test)` constant, so it can only be kept
/// honest by an equality. Both halves of [`GLASS_TRACK_MAX`] are also re-derived here through
/// `gfx::blur_region` itself, which is the check that `BAND_REGION_H`'s clamp assumption still
/// holds — the constant would silently over-state the region if the bar ever dropped past
