//! retui — a retained, UIKit-style view tree for the webOS Plex client.
//!
//! Layered purely over the crate's own gfx/text primitives + spring(): it never
//! touches GL. A View is `update -> layout -> draw` each frame; springs live as
//! fields on the views that own them; the `Painter` folds a cascading alpha (and
//! optional translate) into every draw op. Single-threaded, main-thread-only.
//! (Design: docs/ui-framework.md — synthesized from a 3-way design workflow.)
// **This blankets the WHOLE `ui` tree, and that is wider than it reads.** An inner-attribute
// `allow` on this module covers every `mod` beneath it, so no file under `ui/` — not
// `dispatch.rs`, not `focus.rs`, not `hit.rs`, not a screen — can ever report dead code, and the
// per-file `#![allow(dead_code)]` several of them carry are INERT: measured 2026-09-07 by removing
// one and watching all three cargo configurations still compile clean. So a stale per-file reason
// ("inert until phase 5b") is not load-bearing, and deleting one proves nothing about whether its
// items have callers — which is exactly how three of them kept a reason that had stopped being
// true. The real gate for this tree is THIS line, and taking it away is the experiment nobody has
// run; spec §15.2 wants `ui/` at zero with render caches allowlisted BY NAME, which is the phase
// that gets to do it.
#![allow(dead_code)] // widgets are added module-by-module; some land before their first caller

/// Run one UI entry point (a screen's `draw`/`update`/key handler) behind a panic barrier: a panic
/// inside `f` unwinds only as far as this call, and the frame is abandoned instead of the process.
///
/// **Why this exists — it is not defensive programming, it is an FFI requirement.** `nj_run` is
/// `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"` (the C boot shim in `src/main.c` calls it), and a panic that
/// unwinds *out of* an `extern "C"` frame is undefined behaviour; the toolchain lowers it to an
/// immediate `abort()`. Every UI draw runs inside that `extern "C"` frame, so on this device a
/// stray index-out-of-bounds in a screen is not "one bad frame" — it is SIGABRT, a dead app, a
/// live Starfish buffer-feed session torn down mid-`Feed()`, and the TV back at the launcher, with
/// no debugger attached to say why. Wrapping the DISPATCH (see `app.rs`, where the whole
/// route→screen draw is one guarded block) rather than each screen means a screen added later is
/// covered by construction instead of by its author remembering.
///
/// The `Err` arm **must** release the GL scissor. [`Painter::clip`] is global GL state that its
/// user pairs with a [`Painter::clip_clear`] at the end of the same draw (a bare pair is what
/// `TableView::draw` used to be; it now holds a [`screen::ClipScope`], whose drop restores the
/// enclosing scissor, but the argument below holds for any remaining bare pair) — a panic
/// between the two skips the clear, and every subsequent frame in the
/// process would then be silently scissored to whatever rect the dying screen last set, with
/// nothing downstream able to tell why the UI went partly blank. This unwind is the only place
/// that can see it happened, so this is the only place that can repair it.
///
/// **What this does NOT protect** (do not over-trust it):
/// - A panic on a **worker thread** — demux, load, timeline, poster/metadata/browse fetches. That
///   thread dies and its work silently stops; those bodies carry their own `catch_unwind`
///   (`metadata.rs`, `browse.rs`, `pms.rs`, `img.rs`, `player/mod.rs`).
/// - An **abort**, which `catch_unwind` cannot catch by construction: allocation failure, a double
///   panic (a second panic raised by a `Drop` running during *this* unwind), or a panic crossing
///   one of the OTHER `extern "C"` seams we hand to C — the libavformat AVIO callbacks in `ff.rs`
///   and the Starfish/ACB event callbacks. Those still kill the process.
/// - **Consistent state.** The guarded body ran halfway and whatever it mutated before panicking
///   stays mutated — `AssertUnwindSafe` is precisely the assertion that we accept that. The next
///   frame redraws from the same state, so a screen that panics once normally panics every frame;
///   this keeps the app alive and navigable, it does not fix the screen.
///

/// the per-frame draw dispatch is not a hot-path cost on the A53.
