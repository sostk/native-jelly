//! `TextView` — multi-line text laid out by cap band, pixel-wrapped to a width.
//!
//! The multi-line counterpart to [`Label`](crate::ui::label::Label): give it a raw string and a
//! wrap width and it word-wraps by **measured pixel width** (not a crude character count), stacks
//! the lines by a consistent leading with each line positioned by its cap band (layout ≠ paint —
//! descenders on the last line spill past the box and never enter the maths), truncates to an
//! optional line limit with an ellipsis, and reports the height it consumes so a flow layout can
//! stack the next block below it. This replaces the hand-rolled `wrap_*` helpers + repeated
//! `Painter::text` calls that used to live in every screen.
//!
//! Wrapping is recomputed on `draw`/`measure` (immediate-mode); the runs are short. If a hot path
//! ever needs it, cache by `(text, width)` — the API already isolates the wrap step.
