//! `nav` — **the page transition's PRESENTATION, published once a frame**: the two cascade alphas
//! a route change rides, the pill the shared strip must read as selected while one is in flight,
//! and the dev blurred-dissolve prototype's ramp.
//!
//! **It is no longer a fader.** It owned an [`Xfade`] and drove it (`begin`/`cancel`/`tick`), which
//! made it the second navigation authority in the app: the loop's `nav_commit` applied its route
//! change at THIS module's floor while the container's own `NavStack` ran `Immediate` and committed
//! at the same frame for its own reasons. Restructure phase 12 (D1) put `PageDip` on the
//! application's page stack — the same schedule, the same 70/1/140 ms, the same continuous-chrome
//! rule and the same reversal on cancel, lifted into `ui::containers::transition` where it can be
//! tested against the container that uses it — and this module became what its readers actually
//! wanted: a place to ASK what the transition looks like this frame.
//!
//! **It is a PUBLICATION, not a mirror.** `app::bridge::frame_with_results` writes it from
//! `NavStack::{page_alpha, chrome_alpha}` immediately after the dispatcher's frame, and nothing
//! else writes it — so it cannot disagree with the container, and a reader that runs before the
//! first frame sees the rest values (1.0, 1.0, no pending pill), which is exactly right.
//!
//! The dip schedule is documented at [`PageDip`](crate::ui::containers::transition::PageDip).
//! Its normal page pass captures once at full alpha, then fades the held texture against
//! `theme::CLEAR_RGB` (the app ground). At the floor the incoming page reuses that same texture.
//! Shared chrome draws separately. After In, live content resumes beneath a short held-image
//! dissolve, so content that arrived during the freeze does not jump into view. The live fallback
//! still cascades navigation alpha through `DrawFrame` when capture is unavailable.
//!
//! Two alphas, and the split is the whole design. [`page_alpha`] is for content the swap replaces;
//! [`chrome_alpha`] is for the **shared top tab bar**, the SAME control on Home, the Library and
//! Search, which must hold still while the pages swap under it. Its readers are the ones that draw
//! outside a page's own `DrawFrame` — `ui::popover`'s panel and scrim, `widgets::redraw_profile_chip`,
//! and the glass track's "am I settled enough to sample the ground" test.
//!
//! [`view_tab`] is the other half of "the control acknowledges the press on the press frame": the
//! capsule travels to the pressed pill immediately, while the page it names is still fading in.
//! The pending destination is the container's (`NavStack::pending_dest`); which PILL that page is
//! remains the application's answer, so `app::bridge` resolves it before publishing.
//!
//! **Main-thread only**, a `thread_local!` cell rather than a `static mut` — `ci/check-statics.sh`
//! carried this module as a migration entry ("the statics die in 12") and it is now three plain
//! values behind a safe borrow.
