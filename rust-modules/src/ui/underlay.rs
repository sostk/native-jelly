//! **THE UNDERLAY FIELD — an overlay inherits the light of whatever is under it, where it is.**
//!
//! An overlay in this app has had two ways to relate to the page beneath it, and both throw away
//! *where*:
//!
//! * a **scrim** — `theme::scrim_black(a)` over the whole screen — says nothing about the page at
//!   all, so a modal over a green-lit hero and a modal over a blue-lit one are the same picture;
//! * a **four-corner envelope** — four sampled corners keyed through [`AmbientWash`] — says the
//!   page is greenish, with four degrees of freedom. It cannot say that the green is on the LEFT
//!   of the bottom edge and the red on the right, because a bilinear surface has no such shape in
//!   it. (`RouteGround`'s own live-frame sample used to read this way, through the four
//!   `glReadPixels` taps of `gfx::sample_modal_ambient`; PR2 stage B retired both in favour of the
//!   field below, and [`UnderlayField::latch_from_corners`] is what a caller with no readable
//!   frame — the video plane, a route that opens before Home has drawn — still reaches for.)
//!
//! This is the third: a 15x8 grid reduced from the frame itself (`gfx::field_kick`),
//! low-passed, graded, reconstructed to 60x32 and drawn as one magnified quad with the shared
//! dither. **It is spatially faithful** — the green stays where the green is — and it costs one
//! texture fetch a fragment, because the expensive part happened once, at the latch.
//!
//! **There is no blur pass and there must not be one.** A blur of the page is a different object:
//! `docs/liquid-glass.md` sizes what it costs, and the thing it buys — letter-scale structure
//! softened rather than destroyed — is exactly what a GROUND must not have. Reducing to 15x8 is a
//! box filter with a support 128 screen pixels wide; titles, faces and poster edges cannot survive
//! it, which is the property a four-corner wash always had and which this keeps while adding the
//! one thing four corners lack — see [`RouteGround`](crate::ui::route_screen::RouteGround), whose
//! ground this module has been since PR2 stage B.
//!
//! # The pipeline, and why each step is where it is
//!
//! Every step below is a pure function over arrays, so all of it is gradeable by a host test with
//! no GL context; only [`UnderlayField::latch_from_frame`] and [`UnderlayField::draw`] touch the
//! renderer.
//!
//! 1. **Linearise.** Everything that follows is a WEIGHTED SUM, and a weighted sum of
//!    display-encoded values is not a colour — it is an artefact of the transfer curve.
//!    `gfx::lin` is the one implementation (it is `gfx::diffuse_ground_mean`'s, factored out).
//! 2. **Low-pass** the 15x8 grid with a separable Gaussian at [`SIGMA`] cells, edge-clamped. The
//!    grid arrives from a box filter, whose frequency response has sidelobes; without this a
//!    single bright poster on a cell boundary reads as a rectangle in the finished field, because
//!    Catmull-Rom will happily interpolate a step.
//! 3. **Grade** each cell — and through the SAME functions the four-corner wash uses
//!    ([`AmbientWash::keyed_one`]), not a copy of them, so a ground built here and a ground built
//!    from an envelope are the same colour for the same source. That is what makes stage B's
//!    migration of `RouteGround` a change of SHAPE and not of palette. The grade is defined on
//!    display-encoded values (`GROUND_LUMA` is a Rec.709 ceiling over the stored codes — see its
//!    doc), so this step encodes, grades and linearises again rather than pretending otherwise.
//! 4. **Reconstruct** 15x8 → 60x32 with Catmull-Rom, clamped to the local min/max so a cubic
//!    cannot overshoot a cell pair and invent a colour the page does not contain. Linear
//!    extrapolation outside the grid, so the field does not flatten in the outer half-cell against
//!    the screen edge — which is exactly where a page's own artwork usually is.
//! 5. **Encode** to display RGBA8 and upload through `gfx::upload_rgba`, which already sets the
//!    LINEAR + CLAMP_TO_EDGE quartet an NPOT texture REQUIRES on this driver.
//!
//! # Why 60x32 and not 15x8
//!
//! GL_LINEAR would magnify 15x8 for free. It magnifies BILINEARLY, which is C0: the derivative
//! steps at every cell boundary, and a 128px-wide facet meeting its neighbour at a crease is
//! visible on a 1080p panel as a faint quilt — the same defect that makes a four-corner wash the
//! *right* shape for four corners and the wrong one for 120 cells. Catmull-Rom is C1, so the
//! reconstruction is done on the CPU, once, into a texture that bilinear magnification then only
//! has to smooth 32x further. 4x per axis is where the crease stops being findable.
