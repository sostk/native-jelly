//! The **neutral collection tile** — what a collection with no artwork of its own draws in place of
//! a poster: the placeholder ground, the collection mark, and the collection's name under it.
//!
//! A collection whose server sent no `thumb` has nothing to resolve, so without this the tile is a
//! bare skeleton that reads as "still loading" forever and, beside its named neighbours, as a
//! broken image. The name is the one fact that tells two such tiles apart, so it is drawn ON the
//! tile rather than left to the focused caption, which only one tile at a time wears.
//!
//! **One widget for every surface that lists collections.** It is reached through the shared card
//! composite (`widgets::card`'s poster arm hands a thumb-less collection row here), so the Library
//! grid, a Home shelf and Search draw the same tile without asking. It names no application type:
//! the caller decides that a row is a thumb-less collection and passes the name.
//!
//! A server's automatic 2×2 composite is replaced by the poster store with a baked FAN of the
//! first members (`app::adapters::poster::fan`). The fan leaves the name out of its pixels: the
//! card sets it LIVE over the bake through [`draw_fan_name`], so a fan tile is told apart from its
//! neighbours unfocused too, exactly as this neutral tile is.
//!
//! Both names are set by ONE fitting policy, [`fit_name`]: sized, cased and wrapped from the tile's
//! RESTING width and memoised, so a focus pop moves the laid-out lines rather than re-wrapping them.
//! It measures through the live-font `widgets::LegacyMeasure` (`card` is drawn by callers that hold
//! no `Measure`, and the card composite skips recording passes, so no recorded layout depends on
//! this text); tests hand it the shipped faces' real advances.
