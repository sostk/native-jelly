//! **THE CAPSULE OUTLINE — three circular arcs per corner, blended.** The shape every control face
//! in this app used to draw as a stadium.
//!
//! A stadium is two semicircles bolted to two straight sides: its sides have zero curvature and its
//! ends maximum, and the switch happens in one pixel. That jump is what reads as the end bulging out
//! of the side. The capsule solved here has no straight side and no ellipse — every part is a
//! circular arc, and consecutive arcs are joined by a BLEND arc tangent to both, the way a fillet
//! joins two radii on a drawing. Per corner, from the middle outwards:
//!
//! * `big` — the arc carrying the top and bottom, its apex touching the box at the middle;
//! * `blend` — `f = √(R·r)`, the GEOMETRIC MEAN, so the curvature falls by the same factor twice. A
//!   blend only reads as a blend if no step dominates: at `f = 2r` the first step was ×54 and the
//!   second ×2, and the outline looked broken;
//! * `end` — the end circle, `r = PILL_END_R × height`.
//!
//! Two numbers are free ([`theme::PILL_END_R`], [`theme::PILL_BLEND_SLACK`]) and everything else is
//! solved; `tokens/shape.css` in the design project documents both and every consequence, and
//! `components/core/pillPath.js` is the same solve for the web. This module is the port, and it is
//! deliberately PURE — no painter, no GL — because the geometry is the half that can be graded on
//! the host.
//!
//! **What it is worth at our sizes, measured rather than assumed.** The leftover band
//! `B − r` is both how far the ends sit inside the box and how far the top and bottom bow, and at
//! `PILL_END_R` .492 on a 61px box it is **0.488px**. So on this app's 60px controls the outline
//! lands half a pixel off the stadium it replaces — which is exactly what the design says it should
//! ("reads as almost a stadium"), and which means the visible difference is the CORNER's blended
//! transition rather than a pillowed side. The dial between stadium and pillow is `PILL_END_R`, and
//! lowering it is what would make the bow legible from a couch.
