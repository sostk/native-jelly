//! A raw dwell accumulator, shared so the next caller cannot reintroduce the two bugs that already
//! shipped against `season_settle`.
//!
//! The idle gate parks the frame loop unless the screen reports [`PresentEvent::Motion`] on every
//! accumulating frame. A timer that only adds `dt` never completes on an otherwise-idle page. The
//! note is inside [`accumulate`] so a caller cannot take the increment and forget the report.
//!
//! It stays a raw `f32` add. `motion::Ramp` computes the same quantity from an absolute tick, and
//! that different float sequence diverges a hashed dwell (`SHAPE`'s `season_settle:f32`) against
//! the committed replay fixtures. Do not "upgrade" this to a ramp.
