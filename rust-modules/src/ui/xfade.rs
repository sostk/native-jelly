//! `Xfade` — the ONE content cross-fade choreography: fade the outgoing content OUT, swap the
//! data at the floor, fade the incoming content IN. Sibling of
//! [`Popover`](crate::ui::popover::Popover), which owns the modal *appear*; this owns the case
//! where a screen's CONTENT is replaced under it.
//!
//! **Why it SCHEDULES the swap instead of reacting to one.** The stores this rides on wipe
//! themselves synchronously on the key press — `browse::requery` empties `st.items` in the same
//! call as the input — so by the next frame there is nothing left to fade OUT. A fader that only
//! *watched* the data could therefore only ever be a fade IN, which is the half that does not fix
//! the complaint. So the fader owns the clock: [`Xfade::tick`] returns `true` on **exactly one**
//! frame and the screen applies its own typed pending action there. The animation and the swap
//! cannot disagree, because the animation IS the swap's schedule. `ui::press` defers a click's
//! activation the same way (its `COMMIT_MS`, so the spring-back bounce is on screen first).
//!
//! **Why milliseconds and not a `Spring`.** Everything else that moves in this UI is a
//! critically-damped spring, and that is right for a value the user steers (focus pop, scroll, a
//! panel's appear). This one gates a STATE COMMIT, so it needs a hard deadline: a spring is
//! asymptotic, "arrived" is a threshold guess, and the frame that threshold is crossed on depends
//! on the entry VELOCITY — which is non-zero and pointing the wrong way whenever a second reload
//! interrupts a fade-in. From `gfx::spring`'s closed form `x(t) = (1 + ωt)·e^(−ωt)` (ω = √k), the
//! shared `popover::K_APPEAR` = 300 takes ~337 ms to fall from 1 to 0.02; gating a 70 ms commit off
//! it would need k ≈ 2800 — not a spring any more, an exponential with a threshold bolted on. So
//! the RAMP is linear (exact deadline) and the alpha handed out is smoothstepped, so the dissolve
//! eases at both ends without moving the commit frame.
//!
//! It owns MOTION only — no pending action, no data. Each screen keeps its own typed pending
//! value, exactly as each screen keeps its own focus; a generic boxed-closure queue in here would
//! put a `Box<dyn FnOnce>` behind a `static mut` for no gain.
