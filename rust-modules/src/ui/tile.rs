//! `Tile` — the library's item abstraction for a shelf tile (restructure spec §10): the title,
//! the poster (a server id + path, resolved through `ui::tex`), the resume progress and the
//! watch marks — and [`TileFacts`], the plain value the application fills from its catalog row.
//! The widgets that draw a tile ask a `&dyn Tile` or read a [`TileFacts`] and never a Plex type,
//! which is the boundary the layer gate (§2.1, `docs/module-layers.md`) holds: `ui` names no
//! application type, so a caller above it (a screen) converts its row INTO these facts
//! (`screens::registry::tile_facts::of` is the one converter for a `pms::PmsMovie`) rather than
//! the library reaching into the row. [`TileFacts`] is itself a [`Tile`]. Phase 3a:
//! `widgets::poster_mark` reads through [`Tile`].
//!
//! The trait itself is `nj_base::tile::Tile`, defined in `base` so that the data layer can implement
//! it without naming `ui` (and `ui` without naming the data layer); this is its library spelling.
