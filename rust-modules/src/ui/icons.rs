//! Vector icon assets (SVG) rasterized at runtime into tinted GL textures — the iOS-style
//! "ship the vector, render at runtime" approach. Each icon lives as an SVG file under
//! assets/icons/ (authored as a white #ffffff mask), embedded via include_str!. On first use
//! at a given pixel size we rasterize it (nj_gfx::svg → nanosvg), upload it once as a GL texture
//! (cached), and draw it through the Painter with a per-state tint. Main/GL-thread only.
//!
//! ## Authoring contract (what an asset may contain)
//!
//! The result is a **mask**: only alpha survives, so gradients and multi-colour fills are wasted
//! and the tint is the whole colour story. Beyond that, two rules that are not obvious until a
//! mark looks wrong on the panel — both verified by rasterizing through `src/svg.c` itself:
//!
//! 1. **A mark is ONE `<path>`; a composite mark is that path's overlapping SUBPATHS.** Subpaths
//!    of one path are winding-unioned by the rasterizer, so the joins carry no seam. Separate
//!    `<circle>`/`<path>` ELEMENTS are alpha-composited instead — `a1 + a2(1-a1)` — so wherever
//!    two antialiased edges run together the union lands at ~0.75 alpha and the mark wears a
//!    visible crease. The pre-redraw `popcorn-spilled.svg` did exactly that (140/255 at 34px,
//!    16/255 at 136px — a composite seam gets WORSE with resolution, which is how it tells itself
//!    apart from a real notch).
//! 2. **Every subpath winds the same way** (these are all clockwise). Nonzero fill turns a
//!    counter-clockwise subpath into a HOLE punched through whatever it overlaps, which looks
//!    like a rasterizer bug and is not one.
//!
//! Grade a new mark by rasterizing it at its real draw size and at 4×: full opacity reached, no
//! sub-255 pixel more than 2px inside the ink except where the geometry really is notched (it
//! resolves to a clean gap at 4×), and no ink on the border.
