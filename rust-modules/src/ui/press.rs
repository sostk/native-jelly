//! `press` — the shared "click" press interaction (tvOS-style), the animated counterpart to a plain
//! activation. OK-**down** dips the focused control inward (press-in); OK-**up** releases it back with
//! an overshoot bounce and, a beat later (so the bounce is actually on screen), the caller commits the
//! activation. It is genuinely event-driven — the dip persists for as long as the button is physically
//! held — so a HELD OK is a measurable long-press ([`held_ms`]/[`is_long`]), not a tap. The design
//! (`Home Screen.dc.html`) fakes down/up with a fixed `setTimeout`; the real remote gives us both
//! edges, so we use them. That long press is what opens the **item context menu** on a home shelf
//! card and on the detail page's episode still (`screens/item_menu.rs`) — see [`LONG_MS`].
//!
//! ONE control is pressed at a time (always the currently focused one), so one value suffices — `App.input.press`, the only owner (restructure spec §2.2); draw code reads its published snapshot —
//! the renderer multiplies the focused tile's scale by [`scale`] while [`is_active`]. Focus can't move
//! mid-press (navigation [`cancel`]s the press), so "the focused tile" is unambiguous the whole time.
//!
//! **Two things take this press, not one.** A CARD ([`begin`]) and a CONTROL FACE ([`begin_ctl`]) —
//! the design system's `Button` / `CircleButton` / `TransportButton`, whose dip arrives through their
//! row's [`CtlPop::scale`](crate::ui::widgets::CtlPop::scale). They differ only in whether a HOLD
//! means anything: a card grows a context menu out of one, a control face has nothing to grow, so
//! `begin_ctl` does not arm the [`LONG_MS`] latch and a slow press on a Play pill still plays.
//! Until 2026-08-22 only cards armed it at all, so every control in the app activated on the key-DOWN
//! and the dip the design system specifies (`tokens/motion.css`, `--press-dip`) had no way to appear —
//! `CtlPop` was already folding a factor that was permanently 1.0.
//!
//! Reliability mirrors the scrub commit in `app.rs`: the Magic Remote occasionally drops a key-up, so
//! [`tick`] resolves a stuck press three ways — a real release (after a minimum visible dip), a stale
//! heartbeat (dropped key-up), or a hard hold cap — and a press therefore always commits or cancels.
