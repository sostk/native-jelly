/// [`still_glyph`] is the rule itself: the amber ▶ is a PROMISE — this press starts the video — so
/// it is drawn on a surface whose press does that and on no other. A Continue Watching deck and the
/// detail page's episode filmstrip play; a discovery shelf ("Recently Released Episodes", "Recently
/// Added…") and a Search result NAVIGATE to the episode, so they draw no triangle and the line is
/// the show's name alone.
///
/// The other two marks are not promises. `✓` is a STATE — this episode is finished — and the resume
/// BAR is a fact about how far in you are, drawn wherever there is progress to report, on a shelf
/// that plays and a shelf that does not: hiding it would hide something true, and it was never the
/// thing that read as "this will play". The triangle beside it was. Which is exactly why the bar
/// cannot stand IN for the triangle either — see [`still_glyph`] for the cell where it tried to.
/// The leading glyph on a [`still_line`], as a pure decision — one slot, two things that want it.
///
/// Both are plain masks in ONE box, and the tick takes the line's own ink rather than a hue:
/// a watched line is a statement about the past while an unstarted one is an invitation, and only
/// the invitation earns the amber.
///
/// **The ACTION wins the slot when there is one**, which is the rule the owner asked for on
/// 2026-09-05 stated as a biconditional: *a play indicator means the press plays, a progress bar
/// means progress, and a card with no play indicator navigates.* This function used to hand the
/// slot to `PosterMark` first and consult `press_plays` only in the `None` arm — so an IN-PROGRESS
/// tile drew no glyph at all, and on a shelf that plays (the Library's Continue Watching deck,
/// where nearly every tile is in progress) that is a card announcing nothing and then playing. The
/// resume bar under it is not the announcement: that bar is drawn on shelves that navigate too,
/// which is exactly the conflation being removed.
///
/// **`Watched` is the one exception and it is bounded rather than forgotten.** The tick is the only
/// carrier of "you have seen this" — the bar is absent by definition and the dimmed run is a hint,
/// not a statement — so it keeps the slot even where the press plays. The residual is a watched
/// tile on a playing shelf showing no ▶, and it is reachable on exactly one surface: the detail /
/// season episode filmstrip, where EVERY row plays and no navigating card is drawn beside it, so

/// A landscape still's labels and resume bar. [`Art::Still`] supplies their ground as part of the

///
/// The order is `detail.rs`'s and is load-bearing: the bar belongs to the card's own bottom EDGE
/// rather than to the scrim above it, so it goes LAST or the 78%-black gradient darkens it. That is
/// also why a caller passes `None` for `card_row::strip`'s own `resume` closure and lets this draw
/// the bar — `strip` runs the `extra` hook after the tile is complete, so a shelf that let
/// `card_row` draw the bar and then painted the scrim from the hook had them the wrong way round.
///
/// **It exists because the composition had already drifted twice, and both times in the same
/// place**: a screen draws its shelf through one path and re-draws the FOCUSED tile through another
/// when a modal opens over it (`popover::Opener`), and the second path is the one that forgets.
/// The Library lost the show name and the tick off its lifted tile that way, and Search lost them
/// the same way one commit later — neither visible to a host test, which cannot observe a painter,
/// nor to an FPS scene, which never opens the popover. One function is the fix that generalises;
/// remembering harder is not.
///
/// `rad` is the tile's OWN radius at its current scale (`RowStyle::tile_radius`), not a constant:
/// `card_row` scales the corner with the focus pop, so a fixed 14 clips the scrim to a different
/// silhouette than the artwork under it at 1.09.

// ---- Key cap + key hint: a REMOTE BUTTON named in running prose --------------------------------
//
// "Press [BACK] to return" — the line every read-only alert panel closes with (`Alert Views.dc.html`
// 1A/1B/1C all carry it, 1E states the rule: the panels that hold no control close on BACK, so the
// line IS the whole affordance) and the line the player's failure read-out already carried.
//
// **The cap is the point, not decoration.** `BACK` set in the same prose as the words around it
// reads as a word; the same three letters inside a keyline read as the thing under your thumb. That
// distinction has to survive a PHOTOGRAPH of a television in an issue thread, which is the failure
// read-out's whole output format, and a keyline survives a phone camera's chroma subsampling where
// a colour or weight change does not.
//
// The idiom was written first as a private `draw_hint_with_keycap` in `player_hud.rs`, screen-local
// and centred on `SCR_W`. It is here because the alert panels want the same object RIGHT-aligned
// inside a panel, and the guide's rule 4 answers that: promote the widget, don't fork it. Three
// alert lanes reached for it independently and all three rejected the HUD's CONSTRUCTION for the
// same reason, below.
//
// **The cap is a genuinely hollow ring in the LABEL'S OWN INK**, which is `keyline_chip`'s
// construction and its measured reason — read that one before retuning either. The HUD's original
// drew the ring as a knockout (a white-at-.34 rounded rect, then the interior repainted OPAQUE
// BLACK) and got away with it because the video plane behind the read-out is black by construction.
// On a glass panel that interior is a black hole punched through the frost. Going hollow is
// therefore forced — and the alpha cannot come with it: at [`KEYCAP_W`] 1.5 the SDF's rim coverage
// is the product of two 1.5px smoothsteps, whose overlap is about a quarter of a pixel, so a
// stated `.34` resolves to roughly a tenth of that on screen. `keyline_chip` measured it (~12
// levels above ground where the arithmetic says ~87). Opaque ink is what makes a 1.5px ring exist.
//
// The player's failure read-out no longer draws a key cap at all: its actions are real buttons
// (`StatusOverlay`'s row, `player::failure_actions`), so this is the one cap construction left.
/// The cap's outer height — a fixed band, unlike [`keyline_chip`], which hugs its label's cap band.

// continuous document on 2026-09-05 and Search followed it the same day, and a screen whose head
// scrolls with its content has nothing for a veil to stand on. Deleted rather than kept warm,
// because a shared element with no consumer is a second, unexercised opinion about a problem the
// document shape no longer has; `git log -S nav_scrim` is the recipe if a route ever grows a fixed
// bar again.
//
// It took `/tmp/nativejelly-navglass` with it — the frosted-material prototype of the same band. The
// idea (content should FROST under the top chrome rather than dissolve into flat grey) keeps coming
// back, and the reason it lost is a television measurement, not a taste: both screens held a
// flawless 60 fps with nothing over 20.6 ms, and the material put every second's worst frame at

/// The **UNFURL**: a focused disc grows rightward into a capsule carrying the verb its press
/// performs — icon-only at rest, LABELLED on focus.
///
/// It exists because a disc is the one control that cannot say what it does. At ten feet a bare
/// tick teaches nobody, and a television has no hover to hint with, so focus is the only moment the
/// user can be told. Resting geometry is unchanged: at `e == 0` every number below cancels and the
/// control is the same 60px disc it has always been, which is what lets the whole family opt in
/// without a second widget beside it.
///
/// The open capsule is `LEAD + icon + GAP + label + TAIL` — deliberately asymmetric, the icon side
/// tighter, because a round glyph reads as further from a capsule's end than a stem does. The
/// glyph's own inset slides from the disc's centring to [`DISC_LABEL_LEAD`] across the unfurl, so
/// both ENDS are exactly the shapes the design draws rather than only the open one.
///
/// Sibling of the profile chip's own unfurl (`chip_cap`), and the same two rules apply: the width
/// is the ONE expression both the painter and the hit-test read ([`CircleButton::cap_w`]), and the
/// label rides the TAIL of the widening so its glyphs land in a capsule that has already made room
/// for them instead of smearing across the grow.
///
/// The two differ on ONE policy and deliberately: what happens when the word does not fit. The chip
/// ELIDES to a fixed `CHIP_NAME_MAX` budget, because a profile name is user data of any length and
/// a shortened name is still a name. A verb is not — half of "Mark as Unwatched" teaches less than
/// the tick it was meant to explain — so a control with a hard bound to respect asks

///   forgetting it costs a whole screen's fill-rate headroom for an invisible gradient.

// ---- StatusOverlay: a centred "something is happening / something failed" read-out — a Spinner

// states where NO PICTURE IS ON THE PANEL (Resolving/Connecting/Buffering/Seeking before this
// session's first frame, and Error, which is what a black screen used to be) — a seek over a live
// picture belongs to the transport's inline spinner instead, and `player_hud::busy_surface` is the
// ONE place that division is written down. `kind` picks the treatment, not the words: the caller
// supplies the caption so the state machine stays the single source of that string.
//
// The `frame` is THE AREA THE WAIT IS ABOUT, and the read-out centres on it — pass the region whose
// content is missing, not a region carved out to dodge other chrome. Home's catalog is the whole
// screen (`Rect::FULL`); the person page's shelves are one band, so it passes the band; the player's
// picture is the whole panel, so it passes `Rect::FULL` too. Carving the frame down to "avoid"
// nearby chrome pushes the read-out OFF the optical centre, which is exactly what the player's
// deleted `OVERLAY_BOTTOM` did — it centred the block at y=370 on a 1080 panel. A `Failed`
// read-out that FILLS THE PAGE — the sign-in failure, Home's, a Library section's — is the other
// case: it says so with [`StatusOverlay::page`], which hangs its verdict from
// [`StatusOverlay::FULL_ANCHOR_TOP`] in screen space with the reason and the row stacked under it,
// so all three share one verdict line (and one row line when they carry the same copy). The Library's still leaves its chrome
// live above it (a section failing is not the app failing, `Shared Sources.dc.html` D); it just no
// longer centres in the region under that chrome, which dropped its block well below Home's.
//
// **Up to three blocks, and each answers one question**: the verdict (what happened), the reason
// (why, and what is NOT broken), the action (the one thing to press). Two of the three are
// optional, and an absent one is ABSENT — no gap, no empty band, no draw call — so the read-outs
// that carry only a caption are laid out exactly as they were before the other two existed. ----

/// The rejected alternatives are worth recording because each is the obvious answer from one angle:
///
/// * **Each surface solves its own ground.** The chip sits ~800px left of the track over different
///   hero artwork, and `track_alpha_for` is a function of what is under a surface — so over any
///   non-uniform hero the two land on different alphas and different rim weights. One band, drawn
///   in two densities, with the step at the point the eye is least able to excuse it. It also puts
///   a second caller on `gfx::sample_ground`, which has one latch and one rate counter: the two
///   would halve each other's sampling rate and clobber each other's answer.
/// * **The chip suppresses the track's glass while it is expanded.** Focusing the chip would then
///   strip the material off a control the focus never touched — the "material that steps reads as
///   broken" failure `K_TRACK_DENSITY_ATTACK` exists to keep out, at the largest scale available.
/// * **Merge the two into one surface whose rect is their union.** The union spans the ~300px of
///   bare hero BETWEEN them; drawing it as one capsule paints material over a gap the design shows
///   the picture through. It is the right answer only in the case the geometry now forbids.
///
/// So: one solve, one backdrop publisher, one local consumer. The track samples the ground because
/// it is the surface the ground question was posed about; the chip takes the answer without joining
/// the blur region. The band cannot be two densities because there is only one face value.
///
/// # What the shared face still costs — the chip's ink is not solved for its own ground
///
/// This is the half the four bullets above do not price, and it is not small. `track_alpha_for` is
/// not a look; it is a CONTRACT — it searches for the lightest scrim on which `theme::TEXT_READING`
/// still clears `TRACK_INK_CONTRAST` over **the ground under `r`**. The chip is 800px outside `r`,
/// so the density it now wears carries no promise about the pixels it is actually sitting on, and
/// the unfurled capsule's whole content is a NAME.
///
/// Through this module's own `track_alpha_for`/`contrast` and `theme`'s tokens, for a neutral chip
/// ground at L\* 92 with the track's worst tap at or below L\* 50 (where the solve rests on its
/// floor, `theme::TAB_GLASS_TOP`'s .20):
///
/// | what the chip's name sits on | face | `TEXT_PRIMARY` contrast |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | the flat capsule this replaced (`TAB_TRACK_A_TOP` .72) | L\* 27.5 | **9.74:1** |
/// | the band's face, solved for a dark track | L\* 75.4 | **1.86:1** |
///
/// At L\* 80 it is 2.54:1. Nothing in the app darkens the top band before this — `home`'s
/// atmospheric ramp starts at `HERO_BASE_SCRIM_Y0` (367) and the hero wedge at `HERO_SCRIM_TOP`
/// (162) — so those are raw backdrop pixels, and `gfx::sample_ground`'s own note records a census
/// finding a MEDIAN 26.8 L\* span across five taps of the track alone, a third of heroes over 40.
/// The band is half again as wide as the track.
///
/// **It is not settled, and the shape of the answer is not obvious**, which is why it is written
/// down here rather than fixed in passing. Widening `r` to the band spreads the same five taps over
/// ~1.4x the span with ~300px of it dead — on the narrowest strip that leaves the TRACK one tap,
/// which trades this failure for its mirror image. Making the rect follow the unfurl re-solves the
/// whole bar when focus lands on the chip. Keying `sample_ground` per caller costs far less than
/// its doc used to claim (see there) but puts two densities on one line — which the lane's own
/// geometry change makes less dangerous than it was, since `GLASS_TRACK_MAX` now guarantees the two
/// can never be nearer than `BAND_AIR` and are usually ~300px apart. Settle it by LOOKING, with a
/// ground that varies in luminance ACROSS the band: `pat:ramp`, `pat:edge`, `pat:orient`. Every

/// not, and [`theme::TAB_GLASS_TOP`] holds the contrast table that says why: a blur removes DETAIL,
/// not brightness, so the first density at which the tertiary labels clear 3:1 over white artwork is
/// the flat track's own .72.
///
/// (This paragraph said "0.38/0.46" until 2026-08-19, then ".34/.50" until the tokens moved again.

///
/// The rule is one line, and it is a floor rather than a target: **the glass never goes darker than
/// `floor`, whatever the page does.** A black scrim gives `lum·(1-a)`, which approaches nothing as
/// the page does; the lift is the shortfall, so
///
/// ```text
/// face = max(lum·(1 - a), floor)     g = max(0, (floor - lum·(1 - a)) / a)

///
/// That form was chosen over the two obvious alternatives, both of which were tried:
///
/// * A **proportional** target ("the face should sit N% off the page") degenerates at zero, which
///   is the one ground that actually fails.
/// * **Blending** between a light target and the dark one crosses the page's own level on the way
///   — measured, it passed within 0.4 of a code at a ground of .14, i.e. it moved the invisible bar
///   from an almost-black page to a dark grey one and called it a fix.
///
/// A floor still meets the page exactly once, at `lum = floor`, but that is a page at L\*3 and the
/// band around it is a couple of codes wide. Everywhere above it the scrim is doing the separating,
/// which is what it was sized for.
///
/// The answer is finally walked back until the idle label still clears [`TRACK_INK_CONTRAST`]: the
/// density solve sized the scrim against a BLACK tint, and a lighter face spends contrast it bought.

/// darkest quarter of the frame by construction (the hero wedge is what buys their labels their
/// contrast), so there is nothing behind them to bend. Measured on the dev set's own Home: the
/// blurred face moves a control's pixels by at most 7/255 while this rim moves them by up to 74.
/// Dropping the backdrop also drops the thing that made controls unaffordable — a glass surface is
/// charged for its rectangle unioned with every other, and Home's action row unioned with a glass
/// tab track priced at 3.8x the frame budget. A rim costs one extra fragment op on the perimeter.
///
/// **The weights are the TILE's, plus the container's lamp**: [`theme::CARD_SHEEN`] .22 round the
/// whole perimeter — a card's own edge, because a control face has a card's problem, it sits over
/// artwork nobody chose — and the boost to [`theme::GLASS_RIM_LIGHT`] .28 on the side facing the
/// light, weighted by the surface normal, so a disc's highlight sits on its crown and fades to
/// nothing at its equator. One lamp, the one every card shadow in this app is already cast from.
///
/// The perimeter used to be [`theme::GLASS_RIM`] .14, the GLASS container's line, which was a
/// category error by the design system's own rule: `tokens/glass.css` scopes that pair to a surface
/// you read THROUGH and says in the same breath that every control is flat. A flat control wears the
/// card constant. The crown stays the glass hairline because that is what it is — a specular line
/// from the shared lamp, not a second perimeter — so the edge now runs .22 → .28 instead of
/// .14 → .28, and this rim is the ONLY thing separating a control from its ground since the drop
/// shadow went (`Button::draw`).
///
/// Unconditional on focus, which is the point: the design's rule is that the card constants are not
/// states and the FILL is what focus owns. On the focused near-white `ACCENT` face a white rim is
/// invisible by construction, which is the sign it is an edge and not a fill.

// ---- Rating row: one PROVIDER's scores under the provider's name in words.
//
// Rewritten 2026-08-02 from `Details Screen.dc.html`. It used to draw one badge per score, each
// behind that provider's own brand mark — Rotten Tomatoes' fruit and popcorn tub as tinted
// silhouettes, IMDb and TMDB as logotype chips in their brand colours. All of that is gone:
//
//   * the RT marks had no licensing route (see `ui/icons.rs`), and
//   * the chips were reproducing two more brands' logotypes to solve a problem — "whose score is
//     this?" — that a WORD solves for free, and that naming the provider solves *lawfully*, since
//     referential use needs no licence where a mark does.
//
// So a group is: the provider's name as a quiet MICRO caption in TEXT_TERTIARY, then its score or
// scores. That inverts what carried the colour. Before, four saturated brand marks competed with
// the hero art and with each other; now the captions recede to caption weight and the ONLY colour
// left in the row is the verdict — a red or gold or hollow tomato, a green or drained crowd. The
// row reads as one rhythm instead of four logos.
//
// Rotten Tomatoes is ONE group with two scores under one caption, because critics and audience are
// two readings from one source; IMDb and TMDB are one score each. That is also why this draws a
// GROUP rather than a badge: the caption is shared, so the unit that knows how to lay itself out
// is the provider, not the score.
