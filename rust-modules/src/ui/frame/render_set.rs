/// It was `48 << 20` and the doc said "a placeholder until phase 11 sets it from the 160 MB
/// `requiredMemory` measurement". Here is that arithmetic. Every measured figure is from
/// `docs/distribution.md` §6 item 10 (dev set M16p3, webOS 4.10.2, a `features=release` build,
/// 2026-08-22) and is a `VmHWM`/`VmRSS` reading in KiB, the units `/proc` uses:
///
/// ```text
///   declared budget   pkg/appinfo.json requiredMemory   160 MB
///   boot                                    VmHWM        35 MB
///   browsing Home/detail                    VmRSS   119,044 KiB
///     of which CPU              smaps_rollup           38,540 KiB
///     of which Mali textures    /proc/gpu 20,159 x 4 KiB 80,636 KiB
///   peak, with playback                     VmHWM   155,292 KiB
/// ```
///
/// 1. **The peak binds, not the browsing figure.** Browsing alone leaves 160 − 119 = 41 MB of
///    apparent room, but the browsing caches stay resident when playback starts — that is what
///    turns 119 into 155,292 KiB — so the headroom this ceiling may spend is measured from the
///    PEAK. Read `requiredMemory` as decimal MB (the conservative reading; as MiB it is 4.5 MiB
///    more generous, and this constant is chosen to hold under either): 156,250 − 155,292 = 958 KiB.
/// 2. **Texture memory is what this rule bounds.** `VmRSS` on this set INCLUDES the Mali pages —
///    proven arithmetically in that same measurement, 38,540 + 80,636 = 119,176 against a `VmRSS`
///    of 119,044 — so all texture memory may be at most 80,636 + 958 = 81,594 KiB ≈ 79.7 MiB.
/// 3. **The set is a SUBSET of that**, and the one large, exactly known exclusion is the blur
///    chain: `grab` 1920x1080 + `mid` 960x540 + `a`/`b` 480x270, RGBA8 = 11,404,800 B ≈ 10.9 MiB,
///    built once and never resized, so it is a fixed subtraction rather than a term.
///    79.7 − 10.9 = **68.8 MiB** for the screens' own renders, the `FrameCache`, `extra_bytes`,
///    and the two smaller exclusions (the 160-slot glyph cache, `ui::icons`).
/// 4. Round down to **64 MiB**, which leaves those two about 4.8 MiB and — the other side of the
///    same question — sits above the largest per-screen GPU residency ever measured here (the
///    detail hero, 54.5 MB whole-process; Home's grid 35.8 MB, the profile picker 11.7 MB). A
///    ceiling under that would assert on a healthy screen the moment `tex::resident_bytes()`
///    joins the sum, which is the failure mode a tighter number buys.
/// 5. **`ui::tex::TEX_RESIDENT_BYTES_MAX` (44 MiB) is the pool's OWN ceiling under this one** —
///    it is what actually bounds `tex::resident_bytes()`, the term this constant's derivation
///    leaves room for above; that module's doc has its own arithmetic against this constant.
///
/// **What is not settled.** Every figure above is whole-PROCESS: nothing has yet measured what
/// this set's own sum reads per screen, because until phase 11 it could not be non-zero.
/// **TV session 7 leg 8** (`VmRSS` + `/proc/gpu/<pid>` per screen, panel off) is the measurement
/// that confirms or moves this constant — if the set's own sum on the detail hero comes back
/// within 10 % of this number, the number is wrong rather than the app, and it moves DOWN to fit
/// what is actually held; if a screen's whole-process GPU exceeds ~80 MiB, the app is over its
/// declaration and no ceiling here is the fix.
