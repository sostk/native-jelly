//
// All pure math over `theme` tokens — no GL, no globals, so these are ordinary parallel tests.
// `Spring::step` (used by the dissolve test) is `gfx::spring`, closed-form arithmetic.

/// One sRGB channel, linearized (WCAG 2.x). Local to the tests on purpose: the app never needs
/// this — it is the yardstick the design decision was made with, kept here so the decision stays
/// checkable rather than remembered.
/// The corner sources a ground has to survive: the blown-out extreme, each primary and secondary
/// at full saturation, a mid grey, and the brightest thing in the palette.
