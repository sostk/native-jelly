//! Reusable decision alert — two choices, or a one-answer card. The caller owns focus; this
//! component shares measured geometry for paint and hits, retained paragraphs, and answer styling.
//! Complete translated titles and bodies use the shared left padding edge. Oversized disclosures
//! scroll inside the safe frame while their answers stay visible.
//!
//! [`layout`] is the pure half, `layout(question_h, body_h)`, and `body_h == 0.0` is byte-identical
//! to the geometry that existed before bodies did when the question fits the safe frame
//! (`no_body_leaves_the_geometry_untouched`), which
//! is the shape an alert takes when it asks its question alone. Shipping confirmations and
//! report cards retain their disclosures on the alert, so the body-free test separately guards
//! that simpler geometry. The body is held on the ALERT
//! rather than passed to [`DecisionAlert::draw`] because it moves the controls, and
//! [`DecisionAlert::frames`] — the geometry an owning Engine screen registers its own hit stops
//! from — has to measure the same retained content the draw consumes.
//!
//! **Focus and hit-testing are the owning screen's, not this type's** (restructure phase 12):
//! `DecisionAlert` used to carry its own `move_focus`/`press_at` ladder, driven by a caller that
//! translated a raw key or pointer event into a call here. Engine screens register the alert's
//! answers as ordinary focus-group elements through [`DecisionAlert::frames`] and move this
//! type's selection with [`DecisionAlert::set_choice`], as with any other control. The old
//! two SDL-keysym-shaped methods had no caller left and are gone.
//!
//! **The same sheet is also a one- or two-answer CARD** ([`DecisionAlert::open_card`]): a title,
//! body paragraphs stacked `PARA_GAP` apart, and either the usual two answers or ONE
//! (`Answers::One`), which takes the centred cancel slot while the destructive rect collapses to
//! zero width so no caller can register or draw it. The sign-in failure's *Details* is the caller
//! (its Report ID and support line, *Close*, and *Send report* only while the report can still be
//! sent) — a disclosure that used to grow the read-out under its control row, and was replaced by
//! this card because three buttons and three labels stacked on one page read as a mess (owner,
//! 2026-09-19).
//! A live card feeds its rendered content back through [`DecisionAlert::reconcile_card`] before
//! drawing. Changed paragraphs or answers update in place, invalidate the cached panel ground,
//! and retain any still-valid selection; they never restart the entrance or steal focus for a
//! newly available action. The host's focus engine reconciles a removed action to that selection.
//!
//! **Every interactive exit — confirm, cancel, or BACK — takes [`DecisionAlert::dismiss`], never
//! [`DecisionAlert::close`].** `close` is [`Popover::close`]'s case: a subject that vanished out
//! from under the alert, or a defensive reset before opening it fresh (`consent`'s `open`/
//! `open_settings` both call it for exactly that, unconditionally, before the alert has ever shown
//! anyone anything). A person's OWN answer is not that case, however destructive: the alert has
//! already been seen and already been answered, and the caller learns the choice from
//! [`DecisionAlert::choice`] before anything the answer authorizes runs — so there is always a
//! frame in which fading it out costs nothing but a few frames of a panel already leaving. Reported
//! off `consent.rs`'s "Delete all local data" flow (2026-09-03): confirming jumped straight to an
//! instant hide because the confirm arm reused the screen's own defensive `close()` reset instead
//! of `dismiss()` — this alert had the same appearance animation `exit_alert` shares, and none
//! leaving. A
//! caller that tears its OWN host down synchronously under the alert (as that same confirm arm
//! still does, to the Settings screen behind it) may keep doing so; the alert's fade then simply
//! runs over whatever the app shows next, exactly like a dismissed `account_menu`/`item_menu`
//! fading over the host it returned to.
