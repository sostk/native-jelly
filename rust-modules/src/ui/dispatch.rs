//! The frame — ONE algorithm (spec §3.3), generic over the `Host` bundle and a `Rig` that owns
//! whatever the dispatcher does not: the stores and the other addressable machines, the mounter,
//! the views, the measure, the adapters, and the three privileged OS calls (`ls2_pump`,
//! `opaque_route`, `clear_opaque_region`) which `app/run.rs` implements and this module only
//! names as hooks.
//!
//! The ten steps over one frame, with the step budgets, the parked structural ops, the carry-over
//! that never drops, the single NAV COMMIT with its reserved post-commit budget, the present
//! decision and the prepare/draw pair — over the container tree (`ui::containers::Navigation`,
//! phase 3b: tabs → one shared stack → the shared modal stack, minting every `EntryId` and
//! `InstanceId`). A structural op is REQUESTED at commit and applies at its transition's commit
//! point — a cut now, a dip at its floor — and comes back as `Life` steps this module executes:
//! mount through the one `Mounter`, deliver the §3.4 sequence in the post-commit drain, retire
//! bodies. The activity table (§8.3) is read off the modal stack's host fold: a Frozen host
//! receives no `Tick`, a Cached or Replaced host does not prepare, a Replaced host does not draw.
#![allow(dead_code)] // since 5b screens run through most of this; suspend/resume/set_focus_source_override/viewport/frame_index still have no caller anywhere (grep-checked, not 3b's stale "screens from 5b")
