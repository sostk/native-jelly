//! `glassload` — the dev-only LOAD DIAL for the backdrop-glass chain, and the blurred-route-
//! transition prototype it was built beside.
//!
//! Everything here exists to answer one question the shipped scenes cannot: **where is the cliff?**
//! The Account panel and the tab track are two fixed surfaces at two fixed sizes; measuring them
//! tells you what today costs, not what the hardware will take. So this module turns the four
//! variables that actually move the price into a dial a run can sweep:
//!
//! * **how many** glass surfaces are on the panel,
//! * **how large** each one is (and therefore how large the one shared snapshot region is),
//! * **how often** the snapshot refreshes, in presents,
//! * how large the one shared snapshot region ends up, which is what actually sets the price.
//!
//! ## Why it is a SWEEP rather than a flag
//!
//! `docs/backdrop-blur-profiling.md` rule 3: the television drifts 60 → 50 fps over a session, so
//! legs must be interleaved, never run AAA then BBB. A dial that has to be re-armed between legs
//! makes interleaving a scripting problem and a deploy per leg. This one cycles its own steps on a
//! timer inside ONE launch, so a four-configuration sweep held six seconds a step and cycled five
//! times is interleaved by construction, and every sample is drawn from the same thermal state
//! within a couple of minutes.
//!
//! The current step index rides the once/sec heartbeat as `load=<i>` and every HWCNT phase record
//! as `"load":<i>`, which is what lets one log be split into per-configuration distributions after
//! the fact. `tools/analyze-loadsweep.py` is the reader.
//!
//! ## The grammar
//!
//! `/tmp/nativejelly-glassload` holds an optional `hold=<seconds>;` prefix and then a comma-separated
//! list of steps:
//!
//! ```text
//! hold=6;off,1x608x396@3,2x608x396@3,1x1920x1080@3,1x1920x1080@1
//! ```
//!
//! A step is one of three things:
//!
//! * `off` — no extra draws at all: the control leg,
//! * `<count>x<width>x<height>@<cadence>` — that many GLASS surfaces, where the cadence is
//!   **presents between snapshot refreshes**: `@1` refreshes every presented frame, `@3` is the
//!   shipped dynamic policy, `@0` captures once and caches forever,
//! * `c<count>x<width>x<height>` (or `cf…` for the FOCUSED penumbra) — that many CARD composites,
//!   the `draw_tex_carded` path every art tile takes,
//! * `acct` — the REAL shipped Account popover, presented as its own `ModalStack` surface
//!   (`bridge::open_account_menu`) over the real Home page, so
//!   a synthetic surface and the thing it stands for can be interleaved in ONE launch. This step
//!   exists because a dial panel and the shipped panel were read as the same configuration by two
//!   different agents and disagreed by 15 fps; §"the reconciliation" in
//!   `docs/glass-hardware-budget.md` is what it settled.
//!
//! Any step may carry a leading `s` — **spread**: instead of tiling adjacently in the middle, the
//! surfaces are pushed apart along the diagonal, corner to corner. Same count, same area, and a
//! blurred REGION that grows to most of the screen, because the one shared snapshot has to hold
//! every glass surface in the frame and everything between them.
//!
//! The card form is the second axis this dial exists for. A sibling measurement priced a card
//! fragment at **3.02 GPU cycles and 5.86 arithmetic words** — 3x a textured full-screen quad and
//! 120x a gradient — from four peek-row tiles covering 13.6% of the panel. Card area is the one
//! quantity design controls directly and can scale freely, so "what happens when the panel is
//! mostly cards" needed a dial rather than an extrapolation. Cards here sample four synthetic
//! poster-sized textures in rotation, allocated once; see [`card_tex`] for why not one.
//!
//! Panels are tiled adjacently in a centred grid, so `n` surfaces cost `n` composites inside ONE
//! grown region — which is the shape a real screen has, and the shape `gfx::blur_region_union`
//! is designed around. Two surfaces at opposite corners are a different (worse) case and are not
//! what this dial produces; that asymmetry is recorded in `docs/glass-hardware-budget.md`.
//!
//! ## The transition prototype (`/tmp/nativejelly-navblur`)
//!
//! The route change is a DIP today (see [`crate::ui::nav`]): the outgoing page fades to
//! `theme::SURFACE_APP`, the route flips at the floor, the incoming page fades up. The design
//! question is whether that grey trough can be a BLUR of the outgoing page with the tab bar's
//! glass sitting on top of it. Armed, this module holds the page at full alpha and cross-fades a
//! full-bleed glass surface over it instead, with a tab-track-shaped capsule composited above —
//! and the capsule samples the SAME cache, which is the whole compositional finding.
//!
//! Content is `<mode>[p][:<cadence>]`. Mode empty or `1` = one shared snapshot (what the
//! architecture does today); `2` = force a SECOND snapshot between the two surfaces, which is what
//! a private cache per surface would cost in cycles. A trailing `p` PINS the slab at full strength
//! instead of riding the transition — a 210 ms fade gives a handful of frames to measure and is
//! nearly impossible to photograph, so the pinned form is what a cost run and a capture use, and
//! the unpinned form is what proves the motion reads. Both are behind the trigger; neither changes
//! a default build.
//!
//! Main-thread only. The live state is [`Dial`], a field of the frame plan
//! ([`crate::ui::frame::glass::GlassPlan`]) since phase 11 rather than the eight `static mut`s it
//! was before; the two things instruments read with no borrow of the plan in hand — the live step
//! index and whether anything is armed — are PUBLISHED snapshots the dial writes on change
//! (spec §2.3). Every entry point is a no-op when the trigger is absent, and in a
//! `--no-default-features` build `devtrig::read` is `None` at compile time, so nothing here can be
//! reached at all.
