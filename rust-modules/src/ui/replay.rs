//! Replay (restructure spec §5.5): a recording is a REGRESSION ASSERTION pinned to the build
//! lineage that recorded it. `--targets` mode feeds each recorded input with its recorded
//! resolution and each recorded adapter result at its recorded frame, drives the dispatcher on
//! the recorded ticks (`VirtualClock`), and grades the logical-state hash stream — every mismatch
//! is its own line, and replay CONTINUES, so a change reads as a list of pointwise diffs rather
//! than an avalanche. `--resolve` (phase 3b) additionally runs the engine for real: every input
//! resolves through the focus engine and the recorded `fo` (focus) record is compared after each
//! frame — a mismatch is its own line and replay CONTINUES FROM THE RECORDED resolution, so one
//! weighting change is a list of pointwise diffs. `--targets` runs the same engine but takes
//! the recording's answer silently: it grades the application's machines, not the engine.
//!
//! The application supplies the decoding of its own inputs and results (`Codec`), because the
//! library does not know what an `ElemKey` or an `AsyncPayload` is. A decode refusal stops before
//! stepping that frame; only well-formed divergences continue.
#![allow(dead_code)] // phase 2: the product driver lands with the recorder trigger
