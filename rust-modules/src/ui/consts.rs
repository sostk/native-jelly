/// screen with no keypad, a universal remote's whole extra half) woke the transport and cancelled a
/// press in flight. The invariant is *a press consumed by neither a route-specific handler nor the
/// global key ladder must produce no global side effect*, and this is its guard.
///
/// **Five sources in a lab build, four in every other, because the map has never been one:**
/// 1. [`classify`] — every named [`Key`].
/// 2. **The Lab Diagnostics trigger** ([`nj_platform::labcfg::is_trigger_key`]) — a key this build really
///    does bind, read from `lab.json` rather than written here. `false` at COMPILE time in every
///    build without the `lab-diagnostics` feature, which is every build anyone can install. It has
///    to be in this predicate or pressing it would also wake the player HUD and abort an armed
///    click — the exact pair of side effects this function exists to withhold.
/// 3. [`page_dir`] — the Library pager, a SEPARATE predicate (see its doc).
/// 4. [`SDLK_BACKSPACE`] / [`SDLK_CLEAR`] — the television keyboard's own edit keys, read inside
///    the owned Search screen (`screens::search`'s key match), which the classifier never sees.
/// 5. An ASCII digit **in `sym`** — the who's-watching PIN keypad types straight from the remote's
///    number buttons (`ui::profiles`' own `digit_of`, which owns that behaviour).
///
/// **The `sym` field ONLY, and that is a deliberate divergence from `digit_of`, which also reads
/// the range out of `wcode`.** `wcode` is a SCANCODE (`app.rs::decode_key`), and 48–57 there are
/// not digits at all: they are `]` `\` `#` `;` `'` `` ` `` `,` `.` `/` and CapsLock. The digits'
/// scancodes are 30–39 — which is exactly why 33/34 turned out to be `4` and `5` a few dozen lines
/// up. Mirroring `digit_of` would put the retired mis-reading straight back into the gate this
/// function exists to be, so this takes the spelling the evidence supports: a remote's number key
/// arrives with its ASCII keycode in `sym` (evdev 5 -> scancode 33 -> `SDLK_4` = 52). The cost is
/// that `is_bound` is no longer a strict superset of `digit_of` for a wcode-only punctuation press
/// — which reaches no HUD and no armed click, because the PIN pad has neither. `profiles` is not
/// this module's to edit; `docs/remote-keys.md` §9 carries it as an open finding for the capture
/// that settles both.
///
/// **It still OVER-approximates in one place** and the alternative is worse. A digit is bound only
/// on the PIN pad, so a number press on Home or during playback answers `true` here and still wakes
/// the HUD. Narrowing that means making this route-aware, i.e. a second copy of the ladder's own
