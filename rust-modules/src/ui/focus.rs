//! The focus ENGINE (restructure spec §7.3), owned by `Input`: THE current `FocusKey` per input
//! scope and every group's remembered cursor — the only focus state there is; screens keep no
//! copy and read `cx.focus`. It never mutates a screen: it asks the owner's `Focusable` (the
//! §7.1 query protocol) and answers with a `FocusMoved` the OWNER acts on (scrolling the target
//! into view is the owner's, on that event).
//!
//! Movement, in the spec's order: (1) the owner's `step` had first refusal (the dispatcher's
//! job, before this is asked); (2) the current group's `neighbour`; (3) at an edge, a declared
//! `Link` wins, else the group's `EdgeRule` for that side — `Geometric` is the search for the
//! destination group, nearest by axis distance weighted 3:1 against orthogonal offset from the
//! current element's PLACED rect (`At::SpringTarget`: two fast presses resolve against where
//! focus is GOING) over every group's extent, excluding groups whose `reachable` mask omits the
//! axis; (4) landing by the destination's `Seat` — `Nearest` and `Projected` through the
//! container's own `seat` (`column_near_x`'s contract), `Remembered` from the remembered
//! cursor — except that an UP/DOWN press into a card lattice (`ElemKind::Card` `Row` or `Grid`)
//! lands through `seat` too, on the card above or below the cursor ("down, right, up" closes a
//! square) — `RememberedFirst` is the explicit linked-heading door (remembered cursor, then the
//! first element), `RememberedNear{rows}` only within `rows` element-widths, `First` at the
//! extent's head;
//! (5) the engine records the move and emits it; (6) after a landing, the owner's pure
//! `reconcile(want)` — if the answer differs, `FocusMoved{by: Reconcile}` (the Slot→Item
//! promotion is exactly this); (7) scope: the input owner's groups only.
