//! Adapters as a TRAIT (restructure spec §2.2, §3.1): the application's `Fx::App(H::Fx)` effects
//! leave the machines through exactly one door, `Adapters::execute`, which holds the OS/FFI
//! resources (sockets, disk, the engine slot, the poster workers, the measurer) and never any
//! logical state. The dispatcher reaches it through `Rig::app_fx`; an application's rig forwards
//! to its adapter set, and a test's rig forwards to a [`StubAdapters`] that answers by script.
//!
//! Phase 2 declares the door and the stub; `app/adapters/{net,disk,sys,poster}.rs` arrive with
//! the stores that emit to them (phases 3a and 4). `FixtureRig` is the first implementor.
