//! `Popover` — the ONE open/appear choreography every modal panel shares (track menu, Info card,
//! Chapters strip, profile menu): an OPEN flag + a critically-damped 0→1 appear spring driving a
//! fade + slide-into-place, with an optional full-screen scrim. Each panel used to hand-wire its
//! own `static OPEN + APPEAR` pair, so any motion change was a four-file edit.
//!
//! ## The host page is part of the choreography, and since 2026-09-02 it is part of THIS module
//!
//! A modal stands on a page that is not moving, and on a tile-based GPU redrawing that page is the
//! whole cost of having the modal up. Measured on the television at commit `c75d50ae`: the detail
//! page under an open track panel presented every frame at `draw≈75 ms` — `loop=30` while paging —
//! against 60 fps and `worstframe≈29 ms` for the same page with no panel. The class bisect
//! (`/tmp/nativejelly-drawmask`) priced it as fill and nothing else: `all` 17 ms (the compositor
//! floor), `glass` 50, `rect` 51, `grad` 50, `card` 73, `text` 75 — i.e. the page's own full-screen
//! ground, the modal scrim and the panel's glass each cost a vsync slot and they overlap.
//!
//! The profile menu had solved this for itself in 2026-08 with a private `gfx::FrameCache`, and no
//! other popover could reach it. [`host`] is that mechanism generalised, and the generalisation is
//! what makes it apply to panels the profile menu's shape could not: a popover drawn from INSIDE
//! its page (`about_panel` and `person_bio` did, at the tail of `detail::draw` / `person::draw`,
//! until phase 10 made both surfaces; `decision_alert` still does) cannot be served by "skip the
//! page and draw the panel after it". So the freeze is a REFUSAL at the renderer's one shared gate rather than a skipped call
//! tree: the page's draw still runs and still records its layout and hit rects, the fill is what
//! goes away, and each popover lifts the freeze around its own drawing with [`host::live`].
//!
//! What the mechanism guarantees, in the order the code establishes it:
//!
//! - **The snapshot is the UNDIMMED host page.** [`host::live`] captures on its first call of a
//!   frame, which is by construction the moment before the first popover draws anything — its
//!   scrim included. The scrim and the [`Opener`] lift stay LIVE above the quad, which they must:
//!   the scrim ramps with the appear spring, and a lift baked into the snapshot would then be
//!   dimmed by the live scrim drawn over it, which is the exact bug the lift exists to fix.
//! - **A panel's ground reads no framebuffer at all.** It is the latched underlay field (the one
//!   the modal dim draws, `ui::underlay`) sampled at the panel's own rect under the frost — see
//!   [`crate::ui::widgets::panel_ground`] — so nothing about the snapshot constrains it, and nothing
//!   about it constrains the snapshot.
//! - **HOST DAMAGE refreshes the snapshot; the popover's OWN activity does not.** That distinction
//!   was the bio panel's private `OWN_DAMAGE` ledger and is now [`own_motion`] / [`host::live`] /
//!   [`host::input_scope`] / [`host::page_pass`], shared — attributed at the source and counted
//!   (`idle::take_page_damage`), with [`host_refresh`] as the decision.

///
/// 1. [`begin_frame`] — before anything on the route draws. Takes the page's damage count and
///    decides whether the snapshot still describes what is under the popover.
/// 2. [`page_pass`] — first thing inside the page-drawing closure, on BOTH passes (the visible one
///    and the direct blur source one). An RAII guard: it draws or arms as the snapshot allows, and
///    on drop takes the capture nobody else took.
/// 3. [`live`] — an RAII guard at the top of each popover's `draw` and `draw_scrim`.
/// 4. [`ground_drawn`] — `Popover::panel`, the moment the popover's own GROUND is down.
///
/// A popover drawn from inside its page (`decision_alert`; `about_panel` and `person_bio` were the
/// other two until phase 10) and one drawn after it (the container's surfaces) both work, and
/// neither the page nor `app.rs` has to know which is which.
///
/// ## The snapshot has TWO stages, and the second one is where the frames are
///
/// Freezing the page alone took the detail page under an open track panel from `draw≈75 ms` to
/// `draw≈58 ms` — real, and nowhere near a vsync slot. The class bisect on THAT build said why:
/// `drawmask=glass` 33 ms, `drawmask=rect` 33 ms. Two things left, ~25 ms each, and neither of them
/// is the page. They are the popover's own **full-screen modal scrim** (2 MP of SDF fill) and its
/// own **glass composite + frost** — redrawn on every presented frame, although once the appear
/// spring has settled NEITHER CHANGES. Only the popover's foreground does: the rows, the paged
/// body, the scroll rail.
///
/// So the snapshot grows to the whole composite below that foreground, and [`Held`] is which of the
/// two it holds:
///
/// - **[`Held::Page`]** — the undimmed host page, taken at the first [`live`] of a frame. Serves
///   the entry ramp (where the scrim really is changing, frame by frame) and the blur source pass.
/// - **[`Held::Ground`]** — page + scrim + the lifted [`Opener`](super::Opener) + the popover's own
///   ground, taken by [`ground_drawn`] on the first SETTLED frame. Serves every frame after that,
///   as one textured quad, with the freeze held right through the scrim and the panel ground and
///   lifted only for the foreground.
///
/// **One texture, re-taken, rather than two.** A second full-screen RGBA cache is 8.3 MB against a
/// `requiredMemory` budget two installs share, and it would buy nothing: the only thing that can
/// invalidate the ground is damage that invalidates the page too, at which point the page is
/// redrawn for real anyway.

/// The live-backdrop layer walk knows which z range the held image replaces. Sources below
/// that replacement are occluded; a source above it sees the frozen image without invalidating it.

    // there is nothing behind them, and the scan would fail forever."
