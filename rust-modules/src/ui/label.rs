//! `Label` — text laid out by its **cap band**, painted as ink that is free to overflow.
//!
//! The one rule this encodes is **layout ≠ paint** (the UIKit frame-vs-drawn-content split, minus
//! the retained view tree we don't need). A label's *layout box* is the `frame` you draw it into and
//! the font's cap-top→baseline band inside it — a stable metric, identical for every string at a
//! size. Its *paint* is the actual glyph ink, which may spill past the box: descenders (g j y p q)
//! hang below the baseline, tall ascenders/diacritics rise above the cap. That overflow is purely
//! cosmetic and never enters any positioning maths, so "From Beginning" and "Go to Movie" align the
//! same way. Alignment is therefore string-independent — the thing hand-rolled `y - sz*0.58` guesses
//! kept getting subtly wrong.
//!
//! The same rule holds for the other things we paint outside a frame — the shader-baked focus
//! glow, the focus scale-pop (`Rect::scaled`), gradient scrims. They decorate; they are
//! never measured. Layout only ever sees frames and cap bands.
