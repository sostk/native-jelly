//! Page transitions (restructure spec §6.2): WHEN a `NavStack`'s pending op commits and what the
//! two levels look like while it does. Three shapes, one trait:
//!
//! - [`Immediate`] — a CUT: the op applies at the NAV COMMIT that received it. What the fixture
//!   host runs under, and what every `ModalStack` present/dismiss is; the application's PAGE stack
//!   runs [`PageDip`] instead, since phase 12 (D1) made this the only route transition there is.
//! - [`PageDip`] — `ui::nav`'s dip lifted off its statics: Out 70 ms → one-frame Hold at the
//!   FLOOR, where the op applies → In 140 ms. Same schedule, same smoothstep, same
//!   continuous-chrome rule (`chrome_alpha` is 1 while the shared top bar exists on both sides,
//!   sticky-false for the duration of a retargeted fade), same reversal on cancel. It reports
//!   `Motion` from inside `tick`. The dispatcher uses [`PageImage`] to capture the outgoing page
//!   once, reuses the same snapshot texture for the incoming page at the floor, and draws only
//!   that image during Out/In. Captures render at full alpha; the dip belongs to the textured quad.
//!   On the two CAPTURE frames (the first, and the floor) a glass source walk has no image yet, so
//!   it draws the page being captured live at full alpha; the dip alpha rides the glass composite.
//!   Shared chrome remains a separate live layer. Existing snapshot fences pause the ramp while
//!   the GPU completes a capture (bounded by `gfx::SNAPSHOT_DEFER_MAX`). After In, the image stays
//!   held while the destination reports layout motion (springs outside `idle::decorative`, read
//!   through `idle::page_layout_moving`) or first-frame resource work; decorative springs such as
//!   Home's wash dissolve, hero art reveal and hero focus pop still wake the present gate but do
//!   not hold the snapshot. At visual quiescence the dispatcher takes one full-alpha replacement capture off-screen, presents that
//!   image, then switches to identical live output on the following frame. No VISIBLE frame draws a live
//!   page under a full-screen image. [`PAGE_QUIESCENCE_HOLD_MAX_MS`] bounds a page that never
//!   settles. Screen/input/lifecycle state continues ticking behind the held image.
//! - [`RoutePush`] — the Settings family's push: commit is immediate, BOTH levels are drawn, and a
//!   k=200 spring carries the incoming level in from −0.35 and the outgoing one out to +0.22 (in
//!   fractions of the width).
//!
//! Motion and image policy are pure: no static, no clock but the frame tick, no GL. The
//! [`PageSnapshot`] backend borrows the modal host's ONE FrameCache; a modal or video plane takes
//! precedence and capture failure falls back to live rendering. RoutePush still draws both levels
//! live: it cannot share one image across two simultaneously visible pages.
