//! `NavStack` (restructure spec §6.2): a stack of `Entry`s under one `Transition`. `request` captures
//! the top's `ReturnState` NOW and parks the op; the op APPLIES at the transition's commit point
//! (`Immediate`: the same commit; `PageDip`: the floor), producing the §3.4 lifecycle sequence as
//! DATA — a list of [`Life`] steps the dispatcher executes (construct through the one `Mounter`,
//! publish `Mount` and its effects in the post-commit drain, retire the bodies). A `PageDip` may
//! construct its pending destination during the OUT half so a recording painter can warm text;
//! the body remains staged, outside the live stack, and its lifecycle/effects still begin only at
//! the floor. The container decides WHAT
//! happens to WHOM and in WHICH ORDER; it never calls a screen.
//!
//! Identity: an `EntryId` is minted when the entry is created and survives body eviction; an
//! `InstanceId` is minted at mount by the dispatcher (the `Minter` is `Navigation`'s). Eviction at
//! `CAP` drops the oldest body below the top (its `Unmount` is delivered, its inflight retired);
//! the entry stays, and a Pop that reaches it remounts from its `ReturnState` — which is what
//! `an_evicted_entry_keeps_its_focus_identity_on_remount` grades.
