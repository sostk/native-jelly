/// **The tab bar's glass samples the page the frame shows, on EVERY frame of a route dip.**

/// Reported from the television as a blink when Home's `Movies` pill was pressed: the bar dropped
/// to a dark track over the hero and then, on the first frame of the grey Library, wore Home's warm
/// frosted hero. Both are CAPTURE frames — the dip's first frame (outgoing page) and its floor
/// (incoming page) — where the page image does not exist until the visible pass takes it. The
/// source walks drew no page at all there, so the blur's direct replay painted nothing and the
/// chain re-blurred its own scratch target: the previous source, i.e. the OLD page. And no layer
/// published the dip's alpha, so that stale source was composited at full weight over a page drawn
/// at the floor's alpha 0.
///
/// This drives the product's frame protocol (`app::run`: layers, the source walk below the chrome
/// band, then the visible walk) through a whole dip and requires, per frame: the source walk puts
/// the page under the bar (live or as its image), and the composite alpha the glass is told is
/// the alpha the visible pass drew the page image at.
