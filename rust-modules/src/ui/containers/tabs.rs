//! `TabContainer` (restructure spec §6.2): the shared top strip as a `Row` group the container
//! contributes ABOVE the page's groups, over ONE shared `NavStack<PageDip>` — Home is the single
//! root; a pill is `NavOp::SelectTab`, which covers-and-mints over the existing root rather than
//! replacing it (`NavOp::Root` is the other half of that split: a true replace, root included,
//! for a sign-in/sign-out/profile-switch reset rather than a peer press). The page declares
//! `strip_reachable()` (Home: false while snapped
//! to the grid) and a `Link{STRIP, Down, <entry group>}`; both are `Screen` methods with defaults.
//! A pill's activation is `ScreenEvent::Activate` on the page.
//!
//! The application publishes strip members by stable control identity, with drawn and target
//! geometry from the shared renderer. Removing a destination never renumbers another control.
//!
//! **A cover-and-mint's focus arrival always animates, whichever pill sent it** (issue #17,
//! fixed 2026-09-28). `NavStack::apply`'s `SelectTab` "cover-and-mint" arm — a peer pill pressed
//! while a DIFFERENT root is up, e.g. Home or Search → TV Shows — used `Self::fresh`
//! (`FocusTarget::FirstInGroup`, `By::Restore`) exactly like a `Push`/`Root` mint, which several
//! screens (`library::LibraryScreen`'s `pop_from_rest`) treat as "restored to where it was" and
//! do not animate. A tab press always arrives FROM the visible strip, so that read was never
//! right the first time a tab is visited this session, and it produced a hard snap onto the
//! first content tile with no transition. `Self::fresh_tab` (`FocusTarget::
//! FirstInGroupAnimated`, `By::Dir`) is the fix: same seat, reported as a deliberate move, so the
//! arrival animates the same as it already did for a Movies → TV Shows peer switch — which never
//! reaches `NavStack` at all (`app::bridge::nav_peer`'s early return: both are `AppArg::Library`,
//! `same_instance` by `id()` alone regardless of section — see `registry.rs`), so its own
//! directional DOWN press into the grid was always `By::Dir` already. The fix is in the shared
//! `SelectTab` mint path, not a TV Shows special case: it applies to every peer pill equally.
//! See `machine.rs`'s doc on `FocusTarget::FirstInGroupAnimated` and the regression test
//! `containers::tests::a_fresh_tab_mint_reports_a_deliberate_move_not_a_restore`.
