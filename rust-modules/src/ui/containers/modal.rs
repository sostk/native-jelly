//! `ModalStack` (restructure spec §6.2): a modal surface IS an `Entry` — same `EntryId`, same
//! `Instance`, same `Screen` contract, mounted by the same `Mounter`. The container is the ONE
//! owner of a surface's PHASE (`Hidden | Opening | Open | Closing`); `Popover`'s `open`/`closing`/
//! `dismiss`/`visible` flags are what it replaces, one module at a time (§14). `PopoverMotion` is
//! the appear spring the panel rides, and [`ModalStack::draw_scrims`] is the modal DIM — both
//! belonged to the legacy `Popover` and neither does now. The panel painter still does, until each
//! popover's phase.
//!
//! - `input_owner()` = the topmost Opening|Open surface.
//! - `draw_scrims()` runs inside the PAGE PASS, so the dim is on the framebuffer before the
//!   surface's own glass looks through it — see its doc for the two hand-placed calls it replaces.
//!   Every dim is painted through the stack's ONE inherited field ([`ModalUnderlay`]), latched
//!   from the undimmed host page (or the playing item's corners over the video plane) at the head
//!   of that call, re-latched when the host snapshot is re-taken, reset with the last surface.
//! - `prune()` is the ONLY place Closing clears, so Closing surfaces step unconditionally (the
//!   fade must finish whatever the host is doing) — `the_closing_phase_is_stepped_even_when_the_host_is_frozen`.
//! - `on_miss(style)` is consulted only while the surface is `Open`: a click beside a Compact,
//!   Sheet or PlayerPanel dismisses it; an Alert ignores the miss; an Opaque surface swallows it.
//! - `host_policy()` folds bottom-to-top into the `(HostUpdate, HostRender)` pair the frame reads.
