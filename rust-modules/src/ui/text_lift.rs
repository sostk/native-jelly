//! `TextLift` — the ONE animated focus treatment for a block of prose that is a focus stop but not
//! a card: the About synopsis and Languages columns, a person's bio, a collection's blurb, an
//! episode's title+summary block. While focused the block grows to [`TEXT_LIFT_SCALE`] over a
//! translucent plate with a soft shadow, the mockup's `textLift` component.
//!
//! **Scoped, so it cannot leak.** [`draw`] hands its `content` closure a painter that zooms every
//! primitive about the block's origin ([`Painter::zoomed`]); that painter exists only inside the
//! closure, so a sibling drawn afterwards through the caller's own `p` is never scaled. The zoom is
//! a GPU-side quad resize of the already-cached glyph textures — no re-rasterizing, no new
//! glyph-cache entries — and `Label`/`TextView` need no changes.
//!
//! The mockup's overshooting cubic-bezier is deliberately not reproduced: the block steps the same
//! critically damped spring at `K_SCALE` as every other pop here (the episode still pops that way a
//! row above its text block), and the two must agree on one frame.
