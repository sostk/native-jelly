//! `HeroLogo` — the ONE way a clearLogo is sized, placed, and fallen back from.
//!
//! Three screens draw an item's clearLogo with a text title behind it: the home hero, the detail
//! hero, and the detail page's pinned compact title. They used to pass their own literal bounds to
//! `the old poster store's `logo_tex`` (660×96 / 680×120 / ∞×54), which made the same mark three sizes in one app —
//! and, because every one of those boxes is far wider than it is tall, made all three a pure HEIGHT
//! clamp. Under a height clamp the drawn area is linear in aspect, so a 5:1 wordmark covered five
//! times the ink of a 1:1 emblem and square logos read as an afterthought.
//!
//! The rule is now CONSTANT AREA, bounded (see [`theme::logo`]): solve `h` from `w·h = AREA`, clamp
//! `h` into the rung's floor/ceiling, then contain into the caller's column. A square grows tall, a
//! wordmark grows wide, both carry the same weight.
//!
//! **Layout ≠ paint** (`label.rs`'s rule, applied to art): the band a caller reserves in its flow is
//! [`band_h`] — a CONSTANT, the rung's floor — never the drawn height. A taller logo spills UPWARD
//! out of the band as pure paint. That is what keeps a bottom-anchored hero column from lurching the
//! moment a texture lands, and what keeps two items with different logo aspects level through a hero
//! flip. It also means a hero logo now paints ABOVE the hero scrim's knee
//! (`widgets::HERO_SCRIM_KNEE`) — up to y≈260 on home — where the wedge is still feathering in; the
//! clearance that matters there is the top chrome's (`widgets::TOP_BAR_BOTTOM`), asserted in
//! `home.rs`'s `the_home_hero_logo_never_reaches_the_top_bar`.
//!
//! There is deliberately no fade-in behind the text→logo swap: `ui::tex::logo_src` answers `None`
//! both while the fetch is pending AND when the item simply has no clearLogo, so a cross-fade would
//! need the store to distinguish `P_FAILED`/absent from `P_WANT`/`P_LOADING` first. The swap is a
//! cut, but nothing around it MOVES, which is the part that used to read as a glitch.
