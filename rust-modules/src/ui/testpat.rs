//! **Synthetic grounds for judging a glass material — the test-pattern backdrop.**
//!
//! Every material question this app has (how dense the tab track should be, where its polarity
//! crosses, what the blur does to detail, whether the rim survives) is a question about the bar
//! OVER A GROUND. Until now the ground was whatever poster the hero happened to be showing, which
//! made the answers unrepeatable in three separate ways: the hero advances on its own clock, two
//! simulator instances launched together drift apart within seconds, and a comparison assembled by
//! matching log lines can silently pair two different pictures. All three bit this work.
//!
//! So the ground becomes an input. `nativejelly-testpat=<spec>` at boot, or the `pat:<spec>` remote
//! token live, replaces the page's picture with a pattern we choose:
//!
//! | spec | what it is | what it answers |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `flat:<L*>` | a neutral at that CIE lightness | the density solve and the polarity, one rung at a time |
//! | `ramp` | black → white across the screen | where the material changes as the ground brightens |
//! | `edge` | L\* 10 on the left, L\* 90 on the right | a bar spanning both — the case a 5-tap average cannot see |
//! | `checker:<px>` | a checkerboard | what the blur does to detail, and whether it aliases |
//! | `lines:<px>` | vertical bars | the same at the frequency text actually has |
//! | `hbars:<px>` | HORIZONTAL bars | the only ground a top-or-bottom-edge lens can move |
//! | `orient` | a wedge of bars, tightening upward, light on the left | which way up and round it is |
//! | `hue[:L*]` | six saturated bands | whether the material carries colour or washes it out |
//! | `rainbow[:L*]` | a continuous hue sweep | what a colourful poster does to the bar |
//! | `solid:<deg>[:L*]` | ONE hue, whole screen | whether the solve is even-handed across hues |
//!
//! `solid` is to hue what `flat` is to lightness, and for the same reason: the bar averages five
//! taps across its own width, so a ground that varies UNDER it collapses to one number and the
//! sweep answers nothing. Stepping `solid:0:60`, `solid:30:60`, … holds everything still except the
//! one variable.
//!
//! `flat` is the one that makes a SNAPSHOT possible: drive the ladder with `pat:flat:10`,
//! `pat:flat:20`, … and one launch produces a whole graded set, on grounds that are identical
//! between runs and between packages. The comparison stops being a matching problem.
//!
//! **The pattern is drawn as PAGE CONTENT** — after the hero and the grid, before the chrome — so
//! it is exactly what `gfx::sample_ground` reads and exactly what the backdrop blur sources. It
//! rides the page's own transition alpha, so a route change still dips it like anything else.
