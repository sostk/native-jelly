//! **The resize and page-slide motion of an in-player table popover** (`docs/player-submenus.md`,
//! "Animation"): the Tracks panel's drill-in pages and tab switches, and the `…` popover's row set.
//!
//! The panel is a bottom/right-anchored card whose natural size is its table's measured size. When
//! that size changes (a page push or pop, a tab switch, a live row added) the card does not jump:
//! a [`Spring`] per moving edge carries the TOP and LEFT edges to the new layout while the bottom
//! and right edges stay on the anchor the panel family shares with the control row. Everything
//! here is built from the app's one spring integrator, so the present gate ([`nj_machine::idle`]) knows
//! exactly when the panel is moving and an at-rest panel asks for no frame at all.
//!
//! A page transition additionally moves the OUTGOING and INCOMING pages sideways, both inside the
//! animated card's clip, on a STAGGERED fade: the outgoing page leaves quickly and the incoming one
//! only starts to appear once it is nearly gone, so the two never read on top of each other. Only the
//! incoming page draws a focus pill. There is exactly one panel background, no backdrop
//! capture and no transition texture: the outgoing page is the old [`TableView`] itself, swapped
//! out whole when the next page was built ([`TableView::blank_like`]) and drawn once more, at its
//! own natural size, until the slide lands.
//!
//! **Layout is computed once.** [`PanelMotion::natural`] caches a table's natural rect against the
//! table's own [`TableView::layout_rev`], so the per-frame callers (update, draw, every stop's
//! `place`) re-measure text only when the table actually changed.
//!
//! **Input follows the logical state, not the motion.** A push during a push, or a pop during a
//! push, retargets from where the layers are ([`PanelMotion::begin_slide`] hands each layer's alpha
//! and offset to its new role, so nothing steps). The pointer is the one exception: while [`PanelMotion::transitioning`] it is held
//! (`Screen::pointer_held`), because a hit map built from pages in motion would turn a click on a
//! row sliding past into a click on the row that happened to be under it.
