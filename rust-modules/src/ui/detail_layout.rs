/// available, not the tidiest: it reads as one undifferentiated list and the eye stops seeing any
/// structure at all. Three degrees are in play here, and the hero uses all three:
///
/// * `SM` — one group. Title, identity line and ratings are the item SAYING WHAT IT IS, and are
///   meant to read almost as a single object.
/// * `MD` — a change in the KIND of information. The synopsis is prose; the facts line is date,
///   extent and how it plays. Both still belong to the hero.
/// * `LG` — information giving way to ACTION (see [`btn_y`]'s own note), and
/// * `XL` — the hero giving way to the next region entirely, which is `content_top`'s rung in
///   `screens::detail`, measured off the action row's bottom rather than stated as a page offset.
///
/// A gap is between visual OBJECTS, never between coordinates — which is the whole reason this
/// function adds a measured height before every rung. `+50` between two baselines of 26-tall text
/// is a 24 gap wearing a number that belongs to neither the type nor the scale.
/// "Measured" means the row's real bounding box, which for the identity and ratings lines is
/// their badge/mark (`widgets::BADGE_H`, `widgets::RATING_MARK_D` — both centred on, and taller
/// than, the caption text beside them), and for the facts line is the `CAPTION` cap band its own
/// glyphs match. An item with a taller or shorter line at any step still lands the next one a
/// clean gap below it, and the gaps read the same whether or not the trailer preview has faded a
/// label's alpha (this function never looks at preview state — see `compute_hero_chain`'s caller,
