///
/// The copy is the thing to avoid here and there is a measurement to prove it: this test's
/// predecessor modelled the region inline and left the screen CLAMP out, which priced the tab
/// track at `(940+176) x 252` = 281k px^2 where the real region is `1116 x 200` = 223k — a 26%
/// over-estimate that sat under a passing assertion for as long as the limit existed, and the
/// reason the old limit read as if it had only ~7% of headroom when it had far more. Both
/// surfaces are grown `gfx::BLUR_MARGIN` a side and then clamped to the screen, so the capsule
/// at x=96 puts the union's left edge at 8 (`BAND_REGION_X0`), the band at y=36 puts its top on 0
/// and makes it 200 tall
/// rather than 252. That is `blur_region`'s business, and it is now asked rather than restated.
///
/// The rects are the DRAWN ones: `chip_cap` at rest with a name at its budget, and the centred
/// track `draw_tab_row` builds. Only the chip's left edge reaches the union — the capsule grows
/// rightward and the clearance keeps its right edge inside the track's — so the pair prices the
/// same at every point of the unfurl, which is why one number can stand for the band.
