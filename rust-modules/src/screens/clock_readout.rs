//! **The clock reason on a failed Home or Library read-out** (issue #378's second half).
//!
//! A television has no battery clock: cold-booted offline its date is wrong and the server's
//! certificate fails its date check. `net::keypin` retries with the remembered key when it holds
//! one; when it CANNOT, the viewer lands on a failed Home or Library whose generic verdict does not
//! say why. [`reason_for`] gives that read-out a reason line and the clock glyph, and
//! [`ClockWatch`] is how a screen holds the fact so a frame's draw and its hit rects see ONE value.
//!
//! Not a screen: shared plumbing, named through `super::` like `plaintext_question`, so Home and
//! the Library share it without reaching each other.
