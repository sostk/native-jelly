//! **Full-trailer mode's transport, and the hint that leads to it.**
//!
//! Full-trailer mode (UP with a trailer picture up and focus on the hero) takes the whole page
//! off the screen — logo, meta, synopsis, scrims AND the action row — and puts a trailer
//! transport in its place: the `Trailer` kicker over a title ([`transport_title`] — the item's
//! own by default, the trailer extra's when THAT says something the kicker doesn't), the playbar,
//! the clocks and the state read-out. Those are the player HUD's own pieces drawn through
//! `appkit::player_hud::{draw_scrim, draw_title, draw_playbar}`, so the two transports cannot drift;
//! what a trailer does NOT get is the rest of the HUD — no quality, subtitle, audio or Info
//! control, no tabs and no track menus. A preview session has no PlayQueue, no timeline reporter
//! and no watch state, and a control that writes one has no business on it.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of state the screen already holds, or a small value type
//! the screen owns — so the key policy, the auto-hide and the hint's visibility are all host-
//! testable without driving the process-wide `player::preview` singleton or a live engine.
