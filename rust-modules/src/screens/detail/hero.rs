//! Detail hero policy: dynamic action controls, people credits, playback facts and their exact
//! width/priority rules. Painting orchestration stays in [`super::DetailScreen`]; the decisions
//! here are explicit-value helpers so host tests need no global focus state.
//!
//! Control selection and geometry take explicit `Detail`/`HeroSet` values. The playback-facts
//! helpers also consult cached application policy and the text renderer; they are not all pure
//! host-only functions. The screen owns the metadata identity and supplies the current item.
//!
//! These helpers are orchestrated by the completed screen's direct `Focusable`/`Screen` impls;
//! they do not own an independent focus cursor or screen lifetime.
//!
//! # The `ElemKey` numbering convention this package establishes (spec §13's own instruction:
//! "reserve a range so the next package can pick a disjoint one")
//!
//! Hero controls occupy the `u32` elem range **`[0, HERO_ELEM_RANGE_END)` = `[0, 64)`**. Every
//! constant below is an IDENTITY, not a POSITION — `ELEM_MARK_WATCHED`/`ELEM_MARK_UNWATCHED` are
//! two DIFFERENT ids for the two faces one control wears, never both present at once, which is
//! what lets [`DetailScreen::reconcile`](super::DetailScreen) carry the focus across a press that
//! flips the toggle (see that impl's doc — the engine calls `reconcile` with whatever key focus
//! currently holds, every frame, so identity-as-elem plus a membership test reproduces
//! the legacy `hero_col` correction without a second cursor). Section helpers use disjoint LOCAL
//! slot ranges starting at [`HERO_ELEM_RANGE_END`]; `DetailScreen` projects repeated items to stable
//! engine identities instead of exposing those positional slots as focus keys.
