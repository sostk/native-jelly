//! **About** — the detail page's About footer, read in full, as an alert panel.
//!
//! `Alert Views.dc.html` §1A. The About footer (detail section 5) is four columns; only the FIRST
//! one, the card, opens THIS panel. That is the design's rule and it is stated as a rule rather
//! than as a layout accident: *"a block earns an alert only when the page truncates something
//! worth reading in full."* The card truncates — its synopsis is capped at five `CAPTION` lines
//! with a right-pinned MORE. The other three do not, and each is settled by name:
//!
//! * **Accessibility** is three fixed definitions of CC/SDH/AD that never change and are already
//!   printed in full on the page — no alert.
//! * **Information** is *"four facts the detail screen already prints in full behind the panel, so
//!   they stay there"* — no alert, and (see below) no copy of them in this one either.
//! * **Languages** — the audio list — *"belongs beside the bitrates in Track information"* (§1B),
//!   so that column opens §1B rather than a panel of its own: the shared
//!   [`crate::screens::registry::AppArg::TracksPanel`] route.
//!
//! Do not give columns 1 or 3 an alert from this note. The absence is the design.
//!
//! # It holds the PROSE and nothing else, and that is a correction
//!
//! This panel shipped with a title, a genre line and a four-column facts grid under the synopsis,
//! on the earlier spec's reasoning that the Information facts *"ride along"* here rather than earn
//! a panel. **Both halves were wrong on screen and the design now says so.** The facts sat in the
//! panel while the page printed the same four, in the same order, in the Information column
//! *directly behind it* — visible around the panel's own edge, which is how the duplication was
//! spotted. The title and genres repeated the card the press came from, on the frame that card is
//! still showing them.
//!
//! So §1A is now: eyebrow, synopsis, tagline, hairline, footer. Everything the reader came for and
//! nothing they are already looking at. [`Blocks`] and [`Stack`] carry exactly those.
//!
//! # What it is made of
//!
//! One panel ground and a fixed vertical ladder of runs — no list, no focus, no control, and no
//! state of its own at all. The only key it answers is BACK (and OK, see [`AboutPanelScreen`]),
//! because §1E states the family rule: *"only 1D carries a control — the read-only panels close on
//! BACK."* So the closing `Press [BACK] to return` line is not a hint, it is the whole affordance,
//! and it is the shared [`crate::ui::widgets::KeyHint`].
//!
//! **A `Style::Alert` surface on the container tree** since restructure phase 10 (§6.2) — the
//! shape it always had, stated to the container instead of implied, and the FIRST conversion §0's
//! criterion 5 is proven on. Its `static mut POP` is gone: the container owns the phase, the appear
//! spring (`DrawFrame::page_alpha` IS that spring for a surface) and the dim
//! (`ModalStack::draw_scrims`, off [`AboutPanelScreen::scrim`]). Nothing on screen changes.
//!
//! **It is the panel with the least state in the app, and that is worth stating rather than
//! reading as an omission**: no cursor, no scroll, no selection — the sheet is one measured
//! ladder over `metadata::current()`. So its `LogicalState` writes nothing and its whole record in
//! a recording is the container's: which argument is present, in which phase. There is no UP/DOWN
//! here for a replay to be blind to, which is exactly what `tracks_panel`'s `page:i32` had to be in
//! its shape for.
//!
//! # Two things about it that are decisions rather than defaults
//!
//! **The height is CONTENT-DRIVEN.** The mock hints 1120×360; that is a canvas placeholder and the
//! content div under it carries no height at all. A real PMS synopsis runs well past three lines,
//! and the whole reason this panel exists is that the card CUT one — so a panel that cut it again
//! at a different width would be pointless. The panel grows, and [`syn_lines`] is the last resort:
//! it spends whatever is left inside the screen's glass keep-out and never less than one line.
//!
//! **Its ground is the latched underlay field, not glass** (`widgets::panel_ground`): the page
//! under it sampled once into the 15×8 field the modal dim already latched, windowed to the
//! panel's own rect and graded toward the panel material, under the frost. So it reads no
//! framebuffer, pays no blur region however far it grows, and the page behind it standing still is
//! a property of the host snapshot rather than a condition of the material. It still clears the
//! design's `--glass-edge-clear` 68 on all four sides ([`EDGE_CLEAR`]) — a layout margin now.
