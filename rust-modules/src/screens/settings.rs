//! **The Settings family as a SURFACE with a stack of its own** (restructure spec §6.2
//! `SettingsSurface`, phase 5b): [`RouteSurface`] is one modal entry on the app's `ModalStack`
//! (Opaque, its host cached while it fades in and REPLACED once its ground has drawn) that owns
//! a `NavStack<InnerHost>` of family pages — root → Privacy | Legal | Favourites → Document —
//! and walks it on BACK before the container hears anything (`settings_back_walks_its_own_stack_
//! not_the_apps`). The same type carries the FIRST-RUN consent question: a surface over the
//! picker (or Home) whose root is the first stage and whose second stage is a push, so the two
//! ceremonies share one push spring, one ground and one focus model.
//!
//! What replaced what (spec §14): `ui/settings.rs`'s eleven statics, its `RouteFocus` ladder and
//! `SETTINGS_HOME_RETURN`/`HOME_PUSH`/`HOME_WAS_OPENING` — the two-spring choreography that
//! existed only because the Home editor was a `Route` drawn from outside the modal — are this
//! one stack and one spring. Focus lives in the engine (§7.3); the pages seat their tables on
//! `FocusMoved` and read `cx.focus` to draw.
//!
//! The surface is its OWN [`LogicalState`] (§5.4) and that state is mostly the inner stack —
//! depth, each page's argument, each mounted body's hash, and the seats a pop would restore. It
//! has to be, or the whole family is one opaque word to the recorder and `app/recorder.rs`'s
//! `state_fp` bump bought nothing; the impl carries the argument in full. **What the surface
//! cannot do is make a PAGE's own state cover that page** — `state()` is a trait object and a
//! body that writes only its identity hashes identically however it is scrolled or toggled. The
//! impl's doc carries the per-page census, including the one kind that is still identity-only;
//! read it before believing that a press inside this family is gradable.
//!
//! The push spring is the surface's own rather than the inner stack's `Transition`, because a
//! POP must keep drawing the page it retired until the slide is over, and a `NavStack` unmounts
//! at commit: `leaving` holds that body for the spring's length and draws it in the child role,
//! exactly as `legal.rs`'s index/document pair never swapped roles when BACK ran the same spring
//! backward.

/// **The surface IS its own logical state, and the inner stack is most of it** (§5.4).

/// would have graded every press inside Settings, Privacy, Legal and first-run Favourites as
/// identical". That fold reaches a surface through `containers::Navigation::write`, which hashes

/// draft with focus left on the same row, and the route word, the overlay word and the focus
/// fingerprint are all byte-identical either side of it — so a replay of a run that FAILED to
/// toggle still ended `verdict=SAME`.
///
/// The shape mirrors `containers::Navigation::write` deliberately, because a surface's inner
/// stack is the same object one level down: depth, then per entry its `EntryId`, its argument
/// (`SettingsPage`'s own encoding — `screens::family`, where a new variant is forced through a
/// census `match`) and, when it has a body, that body's `InstanceId` and its own state hash.
/// After the stack comes `remembered`, the per-entry focus a pop restores.
///
/// **WHAT THIS COVERS IS EXACTLY TWO THINGS, AND THE SECOND IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S CODE.** The
/// surface itself contributes the ceremony, the SHAPE of the stack (how deep, which page at each
/// level, which entry ids and instance ids) and the remembered seats. Everything FINER — what a
/// page holds — is a claim about each body's own `LogicalState`, and this file cannot enforce a
/// word of it: `state()` is a trait object, `hash()` folds in whatever that impl chose to write,
/// and an impl that writes nothing hashes identically forever without failing anything. The
/// census, as of 2026-09-07, one line per page kind, so the next reader can check it instead of
/// trusting it:
///
///  * `RootPage` → `RootState`: the selected row's `RowKey` (identity, not position; `remembered` holds
///    the same keys for the root), Automatically Sign In, and trailer autoplay.
///  * `PreferencesPage` (Playback, Audio & Subtitles): the selected field's `RowKey`, confirmed
///    values and pending/error presentation. See `screens::preferences::SHAPE`.
///  * `PickerPage` (one preference's choice list, `SettingsPage::Picker`): which field, the
///    selected option's position, the checked option, pending/error presentation and the Force
///    acknowledgement state. See `screens::preferences::PICKER_SHAPE`.
///  * `ConsentPage` (Privacy & data, and each first-run stage) → `ConsentState`: the mode, both
///    halves of the draft decision, and whether the delete alert is up.
///  * `OnboardScreen` (Favorite libraries) → `OnboardState`: whether it is the Settings or the
///    first-run instance, whether it currently HAS an action band (the group set the engine is
///    reasoning about, cached at `rebuild` for the reason that field's own doc gives), and the
///    whole draft pin list.
///  * `DocumentPage` (the six Legal documents and About) → `DocState`: WHICH document, and its
///    reading position in whole `document_reader::STEP`s.
///  * `PreviewPage` (the five Privacy previews) → `PreviewState`: which preview. **Its reading
///    position is NOT in the hash**, so two frames of one preview scrolled to different places
///    are one word to a replay — the same gap `DocState::pos` closed for the Legal documents.
///    The fix belongs in `screens::consent`, beside the reader that owns the position, not here.
///
/// That last bullet is why this doc used to be worth distrusting and is worth reading now. It
/// said the finer half "rides in through each body's own `state().hash()`" and stopped there,
/// which reads as a guarantee when it is only a mechanism. The mechanism was always in place,
/// and TWELVE of the family's roughly sixteen pages — the six Legal documents, About and the five
/// Privacy previews, i.e. every READER — wrote their identity alone through it. A verifier
/// refuted the guarantee by scrolling a document; the Legal half was fixed in the same pass as
/// this sentence and the previews' half was not. **If you add a page to this family, the
/// hash gains its identity for free and NOTHING of its contents: adding the row here is the work,
/// and a page whose bullet would read "identity only" is a page a replay cannot grade.**
///
/// **The push spring is deliberately absent**, as is `ground_ready` and everything else the draw
/// reads: those are RENDER state, sampled from a wall clock, so folding them in would make every
/// mid-animation frame diverge from a recording of the same presses and turn the divergence
/// report into noise. What the recorder grades is which pages are open and what each one holds.
/// `push.leaving` is absent for the same reason and is worth naming separately, because it is a
