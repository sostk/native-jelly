//! The one place a catalog row (`pms::PmsMovie`) becomes the plain [`TileFacts`] `ui` draws a tile
//! from.
//!
//! `ui` is the library and names no application type (`docs/module-layers.md`, the `ui` layer), so
//! its poster and still tiles, its captions and its page wash take a value the caller fills rather
//! than the row. A screen is the lowest layer that may name both, so the conversion lives here, in
//! the registry every screen is allowed to reach, and not in `ui` (which cannot name the row) or on
//! `PmsMovie` (the data layer cannot name `ui`). Every rule that DECIDES something stays with the
//! layer that owns it and arrives already answered:
//!
//! - **what is in progress** is [`PmsMovie::resume_frac`], the one resume rule, applied here to fill
//!   [`TileFacts::resume`], so the bar, the watched mark and the Continue Watching caption cannot
//!   read it differently;
//! - **whether a thumb is the server's generated collection composite** is
//!   [`crate::catalog::collections::composite_parts`], answered here as `composite_thumb`;
//! - **what kind a row is** is the row's numeric `kind`, named here.
//!
//! Cheap by construction: every text field is a borrow of the row, so building one per tile per
//! frame allocates nothing. Callers build it where they use it (`Art::Poster(Some(of(item)))`)
//! and keep none.
