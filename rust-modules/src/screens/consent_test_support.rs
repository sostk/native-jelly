/// it back; the closest reachable state from here on is `Some(Consent::default())`, silently,
/// for every test that runs afterward in this binary. `consent::current`'s own doc says why
/// that distinction usually matters ("`None` means nothing has been loaded yet — distinct
/// from 'a decision that allows nothing'"), and one production call site really does branch on
/// it (`telemetry::mod.rs`'s `flush_soon`: `let Some(c) = consent::current() else { return }`).
/// It is harmless for every GATE in this crate, which all fail closed on `None` exactly as
/// they do on an explicit refusal — this is `[[test-suite-global-pollution]]`'s general shape,
/// not a correctness bug in the screen. The clean fix is a `#[cfg(test)] fn uninstall()` on
/// `telemetry::consent` (not this lane's file) so every call below could restore
/// unconditionally instead of only when `saved` was already `Some`; centralised here so the
