//! The **profile menu** — a registered `Style::Sheet` surface on the shared `ModalStack`, opened
//! from the top-left profile chip. Switch Plex Home profile ("Change profile" → who's-watching),
//! "Sign out", "Sign in", Settings, and — in a lab build — "Send diagnostics".
//!
//! **Navigation owns its lifetime, its phase, its input scope and its dim.** It was
//! `ui/account_menu.rs` — a `Popover` plus three `static mut`s (`POP`, `TABLE`, `ROWS`) driven by
//! a `Route::Account { over: BarHost }` and a `key_account` ladder in the loop — until restructure
//! phase 10. What that route existed for is exactly what a surface gives for free: the page under
//! the panel stays on screen and stays the top PAGE, so there is nothing to name and nowhere to
//! "close back to". `BarHost` and the route variant are gone with it.
//!
//! Two things stay here that a reader may expect to find elsewhere, and both are deliberate:
//!
//! **The rows are a function of the account state, and that state is the persisted session** —
//! `Session::account`, read at mount and refreshed when the visible session changes. It used to be
//! `session::current().is_some()`, which is a *sentinel*, not a fact: the single-user (no Plex
//! Home) path leaves the active profile an empty `UserRef`, so every surface deciding on its
//! emptiness told a signed-in owner they were signed out. `peek`, not `load`: a menu opening must
//! never be able to WRITE the session file (`ci/check-deps.sh`'s `sessionwrite` gate).
//!
//! **[`chip_label`] lives here, beside the rows it has to agree with.** `ui/widgets.rs`'s
//! `profile_chip` labelled itself from `title.is_empty()`, so on a single-user account the two
//! surfaces disagreed on one screen: the menu headed itself with the owner's name while the chip
//! that opens it said "Sign in". Fixed 2026-08-23 by MOVING THE WORDS to one resolver rather than
//! writing the match a second time; two surfaces cannot drift on a question only one of them
//! answers. That is why `ui/widgets.rs` and `app/chrome.rs` both call INTO this module — the one
//! place in the tree where `ui/` names `screens/` in production code, and a debt that dies with
//! `profile_chip`'s standalone re-derivation when the frame plan lands (phase 11).
