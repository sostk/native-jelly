//! The **item context menu** — a registered `Style::Compact` surface on the shared `ModalStack`,
//! opened by a press-and-hold on a card (or on the detail page's episode still / season tab).
//!
//! The reference is **Apple TV's card menu, not Plex's**: a panel anchored BESIDE the focused card
//! (the card and the rest of the shelf stay where they are, visible behind it), rows of
//! `[leading icon] [label]`, the focused row a filled light pill spanning the panel, and a hairline
//! separator between the navigation actions and the state actions. Plex's own version is a
//! full-screen sheet; that is deliberately not what this is.
//!
//! It exists because OK on a Continue Watching tile **resumes immediately, by design** — the amber
//! play badge on the card is the affordance that says so. The hold is the *other* half of that
//! interaction, and until it existed Go-to-Show, per-item Mark-as-Watched and Play-from-Start had
//! nowhere to live (`docs/parity-gaps.md` §1.2/§1.3, §5a).
//!
//! **Every card surface opens it** — a home shelf, the Library browse grid, a Search result shelf,
//! a person's filmography and the detail page's Related shelf present [`ItemMenuKind::Card`]; the
//! detail page's episode filmstrip and season tabs present [`ItemMenuKind::Episode`] /
//! [`ItemMenuKind::Season`]. The row SET differs only because a navigation row that leads to the
//! page you are standing on is not an action; everything else — the panel, the placement, the
//! choreography, the state rows — is shared.
//!
//! **What remains excluded is excluded for a reason that does not dissolve.** A tile that is a
//! PERSON or a TAG has no rating key and no watch state at all, so every row this module can build
//! would be absent and the hold would open an empty panel: the detail page's cast headshots, and
//! Search's Cast & Crew rows (`search::Item::Tag` has no rating key). A collection has a rating
//! key but no watch state and no row here either ([`has_actions`] refuses it), so a hold on a
//! Collections tile opens the collection page as OK does.
//!
//! **Navigation owns its lifetime, phase and input scope** (restructure phase 10). It was
//! `ui/item_menu.rs` — a `Popover` plus six `static mut`s (`POP`, `TABLE`, `ACTS`, `OPENER`,
//! `ITEM`, `SID`) driven by `Route::ItemMenu { over: MenuHost }` — and every one of those statics
//! is a field of the entry's argument or of the instance now: the ROW the menu is about and the
//! anchor it hangs off travel on [`ItemMenuArg`], the built rows and their actions are the
//! screen's own. The six-variant `MenuHost` is down to the two BITS an action actually reads
//! (`loaded_episode`, `from_home`), which is all it was still deciding once the route it named
//! stopped existing.
//!
//! It still only **reports** the chosen [`Action`]: `AppFx::ItemMenu` carries it to
//! `app::input::apply_item_action`, which does the routing, the server call and the hub refresh.
//! It never mutates playback or PMS state itself.
