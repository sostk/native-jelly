//
// Before this conversion `step` decoded UP/DOWN syms and raw `Pointer`/`Click` coordinates
// itself, and `focus_source`/`hit_source` answered `Legacy` — a suite run against that shape

// repo's own rule for a fix that changes what a test can even call (`AGENTS.md`'s testing
// section, the `prime`/`generation` example), these tests are written against the NEW seam and
// say so here rather than claim a historical red that cannot exist for a mechanism swap: the
// observable behaviour they pin (row navigation order, which copy a commit opens, BACK closes
// the panel) is exactly what the removed raw-input tests pinned before the rewrite, verified by
// hand against both trees during the conversion.
