//! **The Settings family's shared plumbing** (restructure spec §6.2 `SettingsSurface`, phase 5b):
//! the surface's INNER host and its argument vocabulary ([`SettingsPage`]), the conversions a
//! surface makes when it steps a page of its own stack under the outer dispatcher's context, and
//! the two things every page in the family does the same way — seating a `TableView` on the
//! engine's focus and naming its element keys.
//!
//! Not a screen: `screens/mod.rs`'s rule that a screen never names a sibling is what this module
//! exists to satisfy — Legal pushes a document, Privacy pushes a preview, the root pushes all of
//! them, and each names the destination through this vocabulary rather than through the module
//! that implements it.
