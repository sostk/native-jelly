//! **nj_platform::i18n::msg::settings_plaintext_question() — the one question, and every surface that asks it**
//! (PLX-NATIVE-10).
//!
//! Four surfaces ask it: the sign-in read-out, Home's and a Library source's failure read-out
//! (when the server that failed is one discovery OFFERED — `plex::grant::offers`), and Settings'
//! *Unencrypted connections* switch turned on. They share this module rather than a copy each:
//! the question and its body, the two verbs (seated on *Not now*), which primary a verdict earns
//! on a read-out ([`asks`]), the reason line under it ([`reason`]), and the ONE command an answer
//! becomes ([`PlaintextQuestion::answer`] → `auth::SessionCmd::AnswerPlaintext`). The Session
//! owner records it for the signed-in account and, on *Connect*, re-finds the server so a fresh
//! probe can mint the grant (`plex::grant`).
//!
//! The sign-in screen hosts the question on its own alert (it shares that sheet with the report
//! question and the Details card). Every other surface holds a [`PlaintextAlert`] — the question
//! with its own [`DecisionAlert`] and the focus group its two answers form, which traps focus
//! while it is open, as every decision alert does — and delegates its focus, pointer and draw
//! hooks to it.
//!
//! Not a screen: shared plumbing, named through `super::` like `family`, so no screen reaches a
//! sibling to ask it.
