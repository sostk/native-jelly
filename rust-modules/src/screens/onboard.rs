//! **Favorite libraries, as one screen mounted twice** (restructure spec §6.2 "Onboard ×2",
//! phase 5b; the words, the draft model and the design argument are `ui/onboard.rs`'s, moved).
//! First run mounts it as a PAGE (`AppArg::Onboard`, between the picker and Home, on the
//! hero-keyed ground, crumb *Who's watching?*, one action *Start watching*); Settings mounts the
//! same type as a page of the surface's own stack (crumb *Settings*, *Done* only once the draft
//! differs). The type is generic over the bundle's host, which is what lets one impl serve both.
//!
//! The draft model is unchanged: every toggle edits `draft`, nothing is written until the one
//! action commits `BrowseCmd::ApplyPins`, and BACK/Cancel is a pure discard. What that command
//! carries is the rows this session ANSWERED ([`OnboardScreen::answered`]) rather than the rows it
//! showed — the store cannot recover that from the values alone, and used to lose an answer the
