//! **Issue 28, restated against the surface that now answers it.**
//!
//! Until phase 9 this was `app::playback::overlay_swallows_key` — a pure predicate over
//! `Route::Player { overlay }` that told the loop's key ladder whether to `continue` past its
//! overlay arm or let the press FALL THROUGH to the ordinary transport arms. A surface cannot fall
//! through: the dispatcher hands it the key and the ladder never sees it. So the behaviour the old
//! predicate expressed as "does not swallow" is expressed here as "FORWARDS `PlayerReq::Transport`",
//! and this module grades the same three claims the old one did, one layer lower — over the real
//! `Machine::step`, with the real `consts::classify`, rather than over a hand-written `Key`.
//!
//! **Restructure phase 12 (D2) moved who answers a direction and an OK.** Before this package the
//! `Focusable` impl was a stub — one `Free` region of `len: 1` regardless of the panel, `place`
//! answering `Rect::FULL` for any key — and `step`'s own `key` ladder moved every panel's cursor by
//! hand, swallowing every direction and OK itself (`Handled::Yes` unconditionally). The tests below
//! marked **(D2 repro)** are the ones that were RED against that tree; the rest keep grading exactly
//! what they always did, one behaviour the ENGINE now owns rather than this ladder.
//!
//! What it still cannot say is whether the panel visually stays up; that is a device check.
