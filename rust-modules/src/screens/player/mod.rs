//! **The player as an owned `Screen`** (restructure spec §9, phase 9).
//!
//! `PlayerScreen` is the instance the container mounts for the player route. It owns every piece
//! of state the route used to keep in two places at once — the HUD's timer, cursor and dismissal,
//! the scrub gesture, the held-key timer, the repeat gate, the control row's springs and resume
//! clock, the Up Next countdown and the image-subtitle texture set — and it draws the whole route:
//! subtitles, the transport, the read-out, and (through the page-owned `ModalStack`) its overlays.
//!
//! It answers `RenderStrategy::VideoPlane`, which is what tells the frame that what is behind this
//! page is a hardware plane GL cannot read: no `popover::host` snapshot, no `Glass` source pass, no
//! `RouteGround`, no capture. The CONSEQUENCES of that strategy — the present gate, the opaque
//! region and the capture skip — are the loop's three privileged calls (§3.3 steps 1, 9 and 10) and
//! are not made here.
//!
//! **What is here and what is not.** Phase 9 moves the STATE and the DRAW; the key ladder in
//! `app/run.rs` remains a CALLER of this screen for the bare transport, exactly as `ui::press`'s
//! typed facade left the ladders callers of `App.input.press` in phase 2 (§14, "Press during
//! coexistence"). The overlays are different: they are entries on this page's own
//! `ModalStack` and own their input outright, so their arms left the ladder with them.
//!
//! Two fields are PUBLISHED rather than owned by `player::TX` (§2.3): `hud.until` and `scrub.ns`.
//! [`PlayerScreen::publish`] mirrors both into the atomics the draw path and the engine read, and
//! is the only writer of either.

    /// 1. A plain LEFT/RIGHT hop commits on the `TAP_COMMIT_MS` DEBOUNCE again — armed by the
    ///    release, fired from this screen's own `Tick` — so a rapid burst is ONE seek and not one
    ///    per tap. (Each commit is a full reopen + prime on the engine, and back-to-back in-flight
    ///    seeks are what race the demux.) With the loop also arming that same field, the interim
    ///    behaviour was worse than either: one tap issued TWO seeks.
    /// 2. A committed scrub asks for [`PlayerReq::CommitSeek`], which holds a paused film paused,
    ///    rather than [`PlayerReq::SeekTo`], which resumes it. `App::repause_at` is still the
    ///    loop's — the screen states the INTENT and the loop performs it, which is what a request
    ///    is for.
    /// 3. The lost-keyup safety commit is reproduced, on the same `Tick` as the ramp it guards.
    ///
    /// The POINTER half is here for the same reason. A click on the scrubber's registered stop

///    `app/run.rs`'s per-frame block committed it a second time.
/// 2. [`a_scrub_seek_taken_while_paused_holds_the_pause`] — the screen asked for
///    [`PlayerReq::SeekTo`], whose loop arm resumes a paused film; a scrub commit must not.
/// 3. [`a_click_on_the_scrubber_seeks_and_a_drag_previews_before_it`] — the scrubber's registered
///    stop landed on the play/pause arm, and the drag preview had lost its producer entirely.
///
/// **Where the loop is part of the defect it is simulated, minimally and by name.** Case 1's
/// second commit came from `app/run.rs`:1413-1426, which no host test can call; what is graded
/// here instead is the contract that removes it — the screen is the only thing that commits a tap,
/// and it commits it on the DEBOUNCE, not on the press. A second committer on that field can then
/// only be a second seek, which is the symptom.
