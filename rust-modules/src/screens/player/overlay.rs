//! **The player's overlays, as entries on the page's own `ModalStack`** (restructure spec §6.2
//! "Page-owned panels … Player: its four overlays", §9, phase 9).
//!
//! The track menu, the Info card, the Chapters strip and the `…` options popover were four
//! `Route::Player { overlay }` values driven by four arms of `app/run.rs`'s key ladder, over four
//! modules' worth of `static mut`. They are now `AppArg` variants presented on the player
//! page's stack, mounted by the one `Mounter`, styled `PlayerPanel { survives_failure }`, and each
//! owning its panel's state as a field. The container owns the PHASE and the appear spring; the
//! surface owns input while it is `Opening | Open`.
//!
//! **One screen type with an inner enum, not one type per panel**, because they differ only in which
//! panel they hold and share every rule that matters here: what a transport key does, how a held
//! direction is paced, when a panel dismisses itself, and how a decision reaches the loop. A copy
//! of those rules per panel is exactly the drift `overlay_swallows_key` was written to end.
//!
//! **The transport-key rule is the one behaviour a reader must not lose.** A viewer holding the
//! track menu, the Info card or the Chapters strip open still expects PAUSE/PLAY to work, and the
//! panel to stay up (issue 28). While the ladder owned these keys that was expressed by
//! `overlay_swallows_key` answering `false` for exactly those three keys so the press FELL THROUGH
//! to the ordinary transport arms. A surface cannot fall through — the dispatcher hands it the key
//! and the ladder never sees it — so it FORWARDS instead: `PlayerReq::Transport`, which the loop
//! spends on the same toggle, leaving this panel untouched. `More` keeps the old
//! swallow-everything answer for the same reason it always did. `More`'s Quality row is a page
//! (`ui::page_stack`): BACK, LEFT at the edge and a title click pop it, RIGHT and OK push it, and
//! only BACK at the root dismisses; its replay canon carries the page path like Tracks'.
//!
//! **The `Focusable` half is real now (restructure phase 12, D2).** Each panel's own
//! `*Part` wrapper (`appkit::track_menu::TrackMenuPart`, `appkit::chapters_panel::ChaptersPart`,
//! `appkit::info_panel::InfoPanelPart`, `appkit::more_menu::MoreMenuPart`) answers the Engine's query
//! protocol (§7.1) over that panel's real row geometry, and [`PlayerOverlayScreen::step`] no
//! longer moves focus BY HAND: a direction falls through (`Handled::No`) to the engine's own
//! `neighbour`/`EdgeRule` unless this panel's own cadence gate is still waiting
//! ([`PANEL_REPEAT_MS`]) or the engine has just reached this panel's group EDGE and re-delivered
//! the key (`edge_key`, the one place a panel still decides something outside its own scope — a
//! tab switch, or dropping focus onto the HUD tabs below). OK is answered the same way: the
//! engine's own `Activate`/press machinery (§7.4) fires `ScreenEvent::Activate`/`PressCommit`,
//! which [`PlayerOverlayScreen::activate`] spends. A click resolves against the real per-row hit
//! map [`PlayerOverlayScreen::draw`] registers, not a hand-rolled pixel scan.
