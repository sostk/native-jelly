//! **The player's INPUT state, owned by [`crate::screens::player::PlayerScreen`]** (restructure
//! spec §9, phase 9): the held-key timer, the repeat gate, the scrub gesture, the HUD's focus
//! cursor and the HUD's own timer/dismissal state.
//!
//! Every type here was a `nj_run` loop local through phase 1b-i and an `App` field from 1b-ii
//! on; phase 9 moves them into the player's `Screen` instance unchanged, which is what §2.2 means
//! by "HUD/scrub/held/up_next/overlays belong to `PlayerScreen`". Two fields are NEW here and were
//! `player::TX` atomics before — [`HudState::until`] and [`Scrub::ns`] — because a decision read
//! from another thread is a PUBLISHED snapshot of state its owner holds, not state that lives in
//! the atomic (§2.3). [`crate::screens::player::PlayerScreen::publish`] writes both into `TX`
//! after every step, and is the only writer.
//!
//! The predicates are pure and take `now` rather than calling `SDL_GetTicks`, so the host suite
//! can grade them: `hud_visibility_tests` moved here under its own name from `app/playback.rs`
//! (§11's test-module homes). `repeat_gate_tests` came the same way and has since moved ON, to
//! `screens::registry` beside the `RepeatGate` it grades — the item context menu became a surface
//! in phase 10 and needs the same cadence, and a screen may not name a sibling family for a shared
//! word (§2.1).
