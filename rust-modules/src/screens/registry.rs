//! **The application bundle's SCREEN-SIDE half** (restructure spec §3.1, phase 5b): the effects a
//! screen may ask for (`AppFx`), the messages a machine receives (`AppMsg`), and the requests an
//! owned screen makes of the legacy LOOP (`LoopReq`) while the two coexist (§14).
//!
//! **…and, since restructure phase 10, the concrete `ScreenArg` ([`AppArg`]) and the one `mount`
//! match ([`AppMounter`])** — which §2.1 always put here and which lived in `app/bridge.rs` until
//! then. The blocker was stated in this doc and is gone: the argument carried the legacy `Route`,
//! `Route` was `app`-private, and a screen may not name `app::`. `Route` moved here in phase 10
//! and was FOLDED INTO [`AppArg`] in phase 12 — its seven mountable values are flat variants and
//! the enum is gone (§15.2), so a page argument is one value rather than a value inside a value. What §0's criterion 5 buys
//! for that is the thing this module is for: **a new screen touches its own `screens/<name>.rs`,
//! this file, `dev/scenarios.rs` and `tests/manifest.json` and nothing else** — the variant, the id,
//! the `mount` arm and the recorded shape ([`SCREEN_SHAPES`]) are all here.
//!
//! What stays in `app/bridge.rs` is the concrete `Host` and the rig it lends the dispatcher
//! (`AppHost`, `AppViews`, `Bridge`), plus the two conversions that are about the LEGACY trail
//! rather than about the alphabet (`AppArg::from_node`/`node`). The mounter is generic over the
//! host for the same reason the screens are: the views it needs arrive through the `*Like`
//! accessors below, so it names no application type. The Settings family instantiates the same
//! screens a second time for the surface's own inner stack (`screens::settings::InnerHost`), which
//! is how one `OnboardScreen` mounts twice (§6.2).
//!
//! `LoopReq` is a DEBT with a phase number on each variant: a request the loop performs because
//! the machine that should own it (Session, Player, Navigation over the app's real stack) is not
//! on the dispatcher yet. The bridge drains them after every dispatcher frame.

/// The pin over [`SCREEN_SHAPES`] — bump it in the same edit that adds an entry, and say why.
///
/// A committed replay fixture recorded against a different value cannot be LOADED at all, which is
/// the cost this exists to make visible rather than silent; `tools/plxnative-rec rerecord` is the
/// verb (`tests/fixtures/replay/README.md`). The APP-side half is pinned separately in
/// `app/recorder.rs`, over the shapes that are the loop's, so neither pin moves for the other's
/// reason.
///
/// **Phase 10, the Detail page's *About* sheet** (0x844a_099e_5f0e_46d6 → this): `ARG_SHAPE` gains
/// `AboutPanel`, `screens::about_panel::SHAPE` joins the array, and `screens::detail::SHAPE` loses
/// `about_panel_open:u8` in the same commit — which panel is up is the CONTAINER's record now
/// (`Navigation::write` writes every surface's argument, phase and instance hash) and a second
/// copy on the page would be two producers of one fact. A schema transition rather than a
/// rebaseline: a recording taken before it hashed the sheet as ONE BYTE on the page, so a replay
/// could not tell an About sheet from a Track sheet, nor either from the page's own byte going
/// stale.
///
/// **Phase 10, the Person page's biography sheet** (0x4e7f_3aa3_b666_b4b0 → this): `ARG_SHAPE`
/// gains `PersonBio` and `screens::person_bio::SHAPE` joins the array. Its PAGE is in that shape
/// deliberately — UP/DOWN there moves nothing else in the app, so a recording taken before this
/// graded the sheet opening and closing with a hole between, and its page cursor was a `static mut`
/// no `LogicalState` could see.
///
/// **Phase 12, the player's pointer drag** (0x2ba1_a831_5580_d0b1 → this): `screens::player::SHAPE`
/// gains `scrub.drag:bool`. It is not a new piece of state — it was `app::input::Pointer::drag`, a
/// field of the LOOP's pointer machine, which is precisely why a recording taken before this
/// could not see it: the recorder hashes screens and the loop's own shapes, and a scrub gesture
/// half-owned by each hashed as neither. PX-PLAYER moves the whole gesture onto `PlayerScreen`, so
/// "a pointer is dragging the bar" is now a field of the page whose preview it moves, and a replay
/// that diverges on it says so instead of showing a preview nobody recorded.
///
/// **Phase 12, the fold of `Route` into `AppArg`** (0xd7b2_a9a4_39f9_706f → this): `ARG_SHAPE`
/// loses its nested `Legacy:Route{…}` and gains the seven page names flat. **No recorded byte
/// moved** — `LogicalState::write` still emits the `0` tag and the same per-page tag it wrote as
/// `Legacy(Route)`, deliberately, so a page frame hashes identically before and after. What
/// changed is the SHAPE STRING, which is what a shape pin is for: the fixtures are re-recorded
/// because their header names the shape, not because their frames disagree.
///
/// **Detail's independent ViewState refresh** (`0x8249_16e7_058b_2ada` → this): the phase moved
/// out of the optional restore intent into the screen's own logical state. Directional input can
/// cancel focus restoration while server reconciliation remains owed; the hash must distinguish
/// those pages even with no restore intent, because Back can owe a replacement Metadata request.
///
/// `#[cfg(test)]` because the pin is an ASSERTION about the array above and never a value the
/// app reads — `state_fp()` hashes [`SCREEN_SHAPES`] itself.
///
/// **Trailer PlayQueue / item menu** (0x3c0b_74a7_7a48_169c → 0xeb69_f6bf_105f_697f): `screens::item_menu::SHAPE`
/// grows `Action` with `part`/`vcodec`/`acodec`/`title` so Play Trailer can carry the extra's
/// play fields without a second PMS GET.
///
/// **Extras shelf** (0xeb69_f6bf_105f_697f → 0xb462_145d_9477_05de): detail `Spot.saved_col` grows a seventh
/// identity-keyed slot for the extras section, and `DetailIdentity` grows `Extra`. The shape
/// string moved, so recorded fixtures need `tools/plxnative-rec rerecord` before a scenario
/// replay is trusted. Host unit tests do not replay them.
///
/// **0.7 forward-port merge** (0xb462_145d_9477_05de → 0x0e66_311c_e4f1_0769): this bump is not one
/// feature's doing — it is the union of independently-landed changes each side made to state this
/// array reaches, recombined by `git merge origin/main` into the integration branch. Nothing here
/// was rebaselined by hand; the value is whatever `state_fp(SCREEN_SHAPES)` actually produces over
/// the merged tree, taken from a failing run of `the_screen_shape_inventory_is_pinned` and copied in
/// verbatim. Re-record fixtures the same way any other bump requires.
///
/// **Home modal cover state** (0x0e66_311c_e4f1_0769 → this): `screens::home::SHAPE` gains
/// `covered:bool`. Compact surfaces keep their host page ticking, so the recorder must distinguish
/// a Home whose hero timer is paused beneath a surface from the same visible state while active.
///
/// **Home hub identity keyed by listing key** (0x285a_3a99_d1e2_f068 → this): `HomeHubIdentity::Identifier`
/// gains the provider-published listing key, keeping mixed-section hubs stable when their leading
/// item changes libraries while still distinguishing section-specific rows. Recorded fixtures need
/// `tools/plxnative-rec rerecord` like any other shape-pin bump before replay is trusted.
///
/// **Collection page** (`0x54b1_7d5f_d41a_2606` → this): `ARG_SHAPE` gains the Collection
/// identity and the `CollectionAbout` summary sheet (the About panel over the collection store),
/// `PAGE_MEMORY_SHAPE` gains its stable member interner, and `CollectionScreen::SHAPE`
/// joins the inventory. Existing replay fixtures cannot name or restore this page and must be
/// re-recorded before a collection transcript is trusted.
///
/// **Linked collection shelves** (`0x9f04_34b2_c8db_d655` → this): the Library's owned
/// `Shelf` gains `heading`, the linked heading's group and element for a promoted
/// `custom.collection.*` shelf. Re-record replay fixtures before trusting a Library transcript.
///
/// **Detail collection shelf** (`0x38a9_2955_0af8_72f6` → this): detail `Spot.saved_col` grows an
/// eighth identity-keyed slot for the collection shelf, and `DetailIdentity` grows
/// `CollectionMember`. Re-record replay fixtures like any other shape-pin bump.
#[cfg(test)]
// Playback/account preference pages add their arguments and logical state to the inventory.
// The Library's TYPE transaction now names a listing type by code (`LibraryType{code:u32}`) since
// movie sections list their collections too, and its layout reserves an empty answer's read-out
// band (`LibraryLayout{…empty:bool…}`); the previous pin was 0x44f2_b3ed_2851_659a. Linked
// collection shelves then moved it from 0x9f04_34b2_c8db_d655, and the detail collection shelf
// from 0x38a9_2955_0af8_72f6 (see the doc paragraphs above), to 0xbb81_9301_0d21_bc8a on main.
// Localization's Settings pages then join it as LocalizationSettingsV4, with the language
// picker's busy state and the login report alert (0x677d_0944_ef25_3900 before the collections).
// Settings form PR 3: the picker is its own page (`PickerV1`) and the field list is a FormTable
// page (`PreferencesV3`); the previous pin was 0x668c_44dc_797c_5b0f.
// Player sub-menus PR 2b: the track menu owns a page stack (`TrackPage`) and the overlay shape
// carries it; the previous pin was 0x1a5c_e155_557b_e949.
// Player sub-menus PR 5: More owns a page stack (`MorePage`, the Quality page) and the overlay shape
// carries it too; the previous pin was 0x97ff_59c7_9aab_e35e.
