//! **Also available** — the same film held by more than one source, as a list you can walk into.
//!
//! Deliverable E of the Shared Sources design (`docs/shared-servers.md` §6): when a second pinned
//! source also holds the item on screen, the detail page's actions row grows an *Also available*
//! pill with a trailing chevron, and it opens this panel — a `TableView` on the panel ground
//! (`widgets::panel_ground`), the same object the Library's Sort and Filter chips open one page over.
//!
//! **A `Style::Compact` surface on the container tree** since restructure phase 10 (§6.2): the
//! anchored menu the Library's chips already are. The container owns its PHASE and its appear
//! spring; the surface owns input while it is `Opening | Open`; and its ANCHOR — the drawn rect of
//! the pill that opened it — rides on its [`AltSourcesArg`] exactly as `LibraryMenuArg`'s does,
//! which is what retired a `static mut ANCHOR: PanelAnchor` holding a `Rect` (a geometry static is
//! never an allowlistable render cache, §15.2).
//!
//! Its rows use all FOUR of that cell's content places — the leading mark, the label over its
//! sub-line, the trailing read-out, and the right-aligned badge:
//!
//! | mark | label | sub-line | read-out | badge |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | ✓ | `Movies`    | `This account` | `1 hr 57 min` | `1080p` |
//! |   | `Film Club` | `friend`       | `1 hr 57 min` | `4K`    |
//!
//! # The four calls this module implements, and why each is not the obvious thing
//!
//! **A CONTROL in the actions row, not a section of the page.** An item on several servers is a
//! rare fact; a permanent band would spend a whole row on nothing on every other page in the
//! library. So the list is behind a button, and the button itself is drawn ONLY when a second
//! pinned source holds this item — the same "with one source, none of this is drawn" rule the
//! shelf heading's annotation implements as absence rather than as a branch that draws nothing
//! visible. **That gate is `metadata::alt_available`, asked by the PAGE about its own item**, and
//! it is deliberately not a question about this panel: a screen must never have to mount a surface
//! to find out how many columns its own footer has.
//!
//! **The tick marks the copy you are on now**, and the badge is the RESOLUTION class — the
//! vocabulary the hero's badges row already speaks (`ui::fmt::resolution`, one spelling of "4K" in
//! the product). A row is `[library] [owner · runtime] [class]`: the label answers *which library*,
//! the sub-line *whose*, the badge *what you would get*.
//!
//! **OK NAVIGATES.** It opens that server's own page for the film; it does not swap the copy under
//! you. That is also what settles the per-server progress problem: **a RESUME POSITION does not
//! travel between servers** — it is about a file you are streaming from one host — so a design that
//! switched the copy in place would have had to explain a resume position that jumped. Navigating
//! makes it self-evident: you are on a different page, and it says where you are in *that* copy.
//! Like every other menu here this surface only REPORTS the choice; it delivers
//! [`AppMsg::AltSourceOpen`] to the Detail instance named by its argument and the PAGE performs the
//! navigation, which is `LibraryMenu`'s shape and keeps one owner of "what a press means here".
//!
//! This paragraph said "watch state does not travel between servers" flat, and half of that stopped
//! being true when [`crate::viewstate`] began fanning a Mark as Watched out over every source
//! holding the guid. The two halves are not the same claim and the split is the whole point: the
//! **watched flag follows the TITLE** (having seen a film is not a fact about a host), while the
//! **offset stays with the copy**. Nothing here changed — this panel still navigates rather than
//! swaps, for the reason above, which is about the offset.
//!
//! **Ordering is the copy that PLAYS first**, then what a viewer would prefer: higher quality
//! first, and at equal quality yours before a friend's, because yours cannot go offline mid-film.
//! The design's own example pins the first clause against the second — a 1080p copy you are
//! standing on sorts above a friend's 4K one.
//!
//! Explicitly rejected, and not to be re-introduced: merging the copies invisibly and playing the
//! best one (it is what makes a film disappear when a friend goes offline, with no way to see why);
//! a permanent section on the page; switching the copy silently on OK.
//!
//! # Where the copies come from
//!
//! **The identity is the `guid` (`plex://movie/…`), never the `ratingKey`.** Every item-shaped
//! integer in Plex is server-local and starts at 1, so both servers in this household have a
//! `ratingKey` 4 and a section 1 (`docs/shared-servers.md` §1). Matching on one would confidently
//! offer a different film — which is why the STORE is ADDRESSED on the `(server, ratingKey)` PAIR:
//! a resolve outliving the page that asked for it is the normal case, not the exotic one. The
//! store, the cross-source resolve that fills it and the headless `/tmp/nativejelly-shared` stand-in
//! all live in `crate::metadata`, beside the detail fetch whose landing kicks them; this module
//! ORDERS, MARKS and DRAWS and owns nothing else.
//!
//! **Rows are a SNAPSHOT, refreshed against a stamp.** `TableView` is built once and drawn from,
//! so a correction reaching the store — a re-described source's credit, a revoked share — has to
//! be carried the last step by rebuilding. The stamp is the row list itself, so a rebuild happens
//! exactly when the drawn content would differ, and the ORDER moves with the text (the credit is
//! the own-before-a-friend's tiebreak, so a corrected panel can legitimately swap two of its rows).
//! The cursor is KEPT across a rebuild rather than re-seated on the tick: the rows can re-order
//! beneath it, which is a smaller surprise than the cursor jumping mid-interaction.
