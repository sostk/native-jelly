//! The person page's **bio alert panel** — the full biography, behind the truncation mark.
//!
//! **The reference is `Alert Views.dc.html` §1C · Person** (the owner's design project): a centred
//! 1120×700 sheet with 48px of padding and a [`theme::ALERT_PANEL_RAD`] corner, holding an
//! eyebrow, the name, an identity line, and — between two hairlines — the biography as a
//! **scrolling, paged viewport** with a feathered edge and a rail down its right side. The footer
//! states what the page knows about this person's presence in the library, and how to leave.
//!
//! **It is the panel BEHIND the mark, not a replacement for it.** `person.rs`'s bio block dissolves
//! its third line into a right-pinned `MORE` (`TextView::fade_last` + the pinned label), and that
//! affordance is unchanged: `MORE` is still a mark rather than a control, still unfocusable, still
//! drawn only when `bio.truncates(BIO_W)`. This panel is what OK on the header now opens, and it is
//! gated on **exactly that same predicate** — `PersonScreen::bio_more` (the header's measured `bio.truncates(BIO_W)`). A panel that opened on a
//! two-line bio would show the reader the words they had just finished reading.
//!
//! ## Three things here are not obvious
//!
//! **1. Its ground is the page's own light, latched once, and its dim is heavier than a menu's.**
//! The sheet stands on `widgets::panel_ground`: the container's underlay field, sampled from the
//! UNDIMMED page at the head of the dim (`containers::modal::ModalUnderlay`), drawn through the
//! panel's own window and frosted. It used to be the app's one `Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP`, re-blurring
//! the host on every changed present, because a CACHED snapshot taken while its own scrim was still
//! ramping through zero frosted an undimmed page — and on this page that is not hypothetical:
//! `person.rs` draws the person's own name at `size::DISPLAY` (48) at x≈474, y≈96, *directly behind
//! this panel's top-left corner*, where the eyebrow and the identity line sit. A 15x8 field cannot
//! carry a name — a box 128px wide reduces lettering to a faint lift of its cell — and the panel's
//! luma ceiling (`theme::underlay::PANEL_LUMA_MAX`) caps even that, so the refreshing backdrop, its
//! cadence hook and the FPS work it needed went with it. The page around the panel is still dimmed
//! at [`theme::underlay::DIM_PROSE`] — the measured text-legibility floor [`theme::SCRIM_TEXT_A`],
//! as the PROSE role's weight — because a panel of fine print over a headline should stand further
//! forward than a menu does.
//!
//! **2. Paragraphs are separate views, because `TextView` cannot hold them.** `TextView::wrap`
//! splits on `char::is_whitespace` and reflows the lot, so a `\n\n` in a plex.tv biography is
//! destroyed — every paragraph break in the source becomes a single space. The block is therefore
//! [`paragraphs`] + one memoised `TextView` each, stacked on [`PARA_GAP`]. That also buys the
//! per-paragraph cull for free.
//!
//! **3. Nothing here animates from a clock.** The scroll is a [`Spring`], so `gfx::spring` reports
//! it to [`nj_machine::idle`] and the present gate sees the paging motion without this module opting
//! in. That is deliberate rather than incidental — `Xfade` and `Spinner` both shipped FROZEN behind
//! that gate because they integrate milliseconds, and a hand-rolled scroll offset here would have
//! been the third. The discrete transitions ([`open`]/[`close`]/[`move_focus`]) still call
//! `idle::invalidate` because a state change is not motion.
