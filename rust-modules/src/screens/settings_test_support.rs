//! Shared fixtures and helpers for the `screens::settings` test modules split out below.
//!
//! **No SDL, no GL, no `Dispatcher`.** `RouteSurface` is generic over any `H: AppLike`
//! (`registry::AppLike`'s blanket impl), and `family::InnerHost` already satisfies that bound
//! — the exact fact that lets the Settings family mount its own pages a second time inside
//! the surface (§6.2). So a test here drives `RouteSurface` as `Machine<InnerHost>` directly,
//! with a hand-built `Cx`/`Effects` standing in for the outer dispatcher, and reads the
//! effects it emits — the same shape `ui/fixture.rs` and `containers/tests.rs` use, minus the
//! `Dispatcher` itself, which only `app/bridge.rs`'s `AppHost` can stand up (its `Arg` carries
//! the legacy `Route`, which this layer may not name). What this style CANNOT see is
//! anything the real focus ENGINE would do — a raw `Key::Down` here moves nothing, because
//! there is no engine in this harness to turn it into a `FocusMoved`; the tests below drive
//! the engine's own primitives (`FocusMoved`, `Activate`) directly instead, which is what
//! `bridge.rs`'s own `the_settings_surface_owns_input_and_walks_its_own_stack` cannot do from
//! outside `app/`, since it drives real keys through the real engine and never inspects a
//! `FocusKey` at all.
