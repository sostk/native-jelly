//! Adaptive playback has two deliberately separate controllers.
//!
//! The HLS rung controller is physical. A finite response at the current rendition is
//! demand-capped and therefore cannot reveal unused path capacity. Completed acquisitions form a
//! finite bag `(A_i, D_i)` and decide only what they directly identify:
//!
//! ```text
//! sustainable  <=> ΣA_i <= ΣD_i
//! ordered R_o    =  max_i(Σ_{j<i}(A_j-D_j) + A_i)
//! stress R_s     =  Σ(A_i-D_i)+ + max_i min(A_i,D_i)
//! exploration E  =  (B-max(R_s,D_next))+
//! ```
//!
//! An upshift is the missing excitation. PMS uses fixed-rendition sessions, so the candidate is
//! primed as a separate encoder under the absolute `E` deadline and commits only from its own
//! completed `A <= D && B_post >= A` evidence. `R_o` diagnoses the observed current-point queue;
//! `R_s` remains a retrospective stress diagnostic and conservative experiment-funding runway, not
//! a predictive downshift trigger. There is no dwell, rate headroom, fixed buffer threshold, passive
//! capacity ceiling or probability claim in that decision. Abandoned prefixes are censored and
//! never become capacity samples.
//!
//! **One term in the upshift is NOT physics and is marked as such**
//! (`Controller::upshift_earns_its_visible_switch`). Every committed rung change is a picture the
//! viewer sees change, and the physics above is happy to make one a few seconds after every
//! collapse — measured on a link alternating 20/3 Mbit/s: ten committed changes in ninety seconds.
//! So an upshift must also buy more quality than [`AbrPolicy::visible_switch_penalty`] prices its
//! interruption at, on the history of changes this playback has already made and halving every
//! [`AbrPolicy::visible_switch_decay_ms`]. It is a product weight, not an inferred probability, it
//! is charged to no downshift, and the first change of a playback is free.
//!
//! Original versus HLS is a product utility decision, not a network theorem. Original creates a
//! new stream and visibly reloads the pipeline, but preserves direct-play/remux quality, DV/Atmos
//! and removes recurring PMS video-encode work. Those recurring effects scale with remaining
//! playback; the one-time visible transition cost does not. The weights are explicit product
//! choices and must never be described as inferred probabilities.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately does not model
//!
//! * **Decoder/render health.** This television publishes no trustworthy dropped-frame or
//!   decoder-starvation counter — the heartbeat's `vtick=`/`vgap=` pair counts a 5 Hz position
//!   callback and reads flat straight through a visible stutter (see the `docs/agent-reference.md` instrument
//!   note). A proxy invented here would be an unfalsifiable input to every decision below, so
//!   candidate feasibility asks the device's codec table (a fact) and nothing asks the decoder
//!   how it feels.
//! * **Thermal state.** Both a throttling SoC and a throttling server arrive as what they
//!   actually are here: production ratio drift, delivery drift, buffer slope.
//! * **Anything learned.** Every number below is a measurement or a policy constant with a
//!   product meaning in [`AbrPolicy`].
//!
//! All presentation values are normalized [`MediaTimeMs`] values. Raw FFmpeg PTS, segment-local
//! offsets and discontinuity counters do not cross this boundary. See
//! `docs/adaptive-playback.md` for the current contract and
//! `docs/adaptive-playback-spec.md` for its derivation/history.

// The split is by DECISION STAGE, matching the pipeline in the doc above: `plant` is what the
// world does, `estimate` is what we believe about it, `viability`/`mode` are the comparisons,
// `controller` is the transaction that acts. `ladder` and `units` are the vocabulary all of them
// share. Re-exported flat, because `abr::Rung` is the name the rest of the crate has always used
// and a split is not a reason to churn 26 call sites.
