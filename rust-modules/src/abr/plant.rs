/// **The per-candidate refill filter** — N3's `R_j <= R_max_j`, and the resolution of an ambiguity
/// the previous plan carried: `R` appears on BOTH sides of the algebra, so a single scalar budget
/// compared against every candidate is not well defined. It is evaluated per candidate.
///
/// ```text
/// D_j     = max(0, B*(R_j) - B)                        the deficit against THIS candidate's target
/// R_max_j = C_safe * H / (H + D_j)                     what may be spent while still closing it
/// ```
///
/// The reading: a candidate that leaves the reserve short has to leave room to refill that
/// shortfall inside the horizon `H`, and the rate it may claim shrinks in proportion. With no
/// deficit `D_j = 0` and `R_max_j = C_safe` exactly — the filter is then the identity, which is
/// the state every healthy playback is in and the reason this lands without moving anything.
///
/// **Integer, and associated so it cannot divide first.** `C_safe * H` before the division by
/// `H + D_j`; at `C_safe = 20 000` and `H = 10 000` that is 2e8, nowhere near `i64`.
///
/// **The monotonicity obligation, because the predicate is not trivially well-posed.**
/// `B_max_est` decreases in `R`, so `D_j` decreases in `R_j`, so `R_max_j` INCREASES in `R_j` —
/// both sides of `R_j <= R_max_j` move the same way, which is the shape that can admit a scattered
/// set rather than a prefix of the ladder. It is a prefix today only because `B*` is capped at
/// `buffer_target_ms`, which pins `R_max_j` into `[0.8*C_safe, C_safe]` at `H = 10 s`. That is a
/// property of the current numbers, not of the form, so
/// `tests::the_refill_filter_admits_a_prefix_of_the_ladder` asserts it over a magnitude sweep and
/// is what protects it when `buffer_target_ms` moves after M4.
///
/// **One limitation, stated rather than fixed by mixing dimensions.** `C_safe` is measured over
/// `active_fetch_us`, so this refill filter is a prospective delivery/reserve planner rather than
/// a wall-clock completion certificate. The candidate transaction supplies that certificate from
/// its own complete end-to-end acquisition. Folding the total-acquisition ratio in here would
/// charge the same server wait, pacing and path-service episode a second time.
