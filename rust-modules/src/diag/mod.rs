//! **Typed usage events plus the lab diagnostics plumbing.**
//!
//! Three pieces were lifted out of `lab/` on 2026-08-29 when a second consumer appeared. They were
//! written for the Cloud Lab bridge, they were correct, and none of them was lab-shaped. Two of
//! them, the redaction pass and the record ring, are the event log's own guards and now live
//! under it as `nj_base::eventlog::{scrub, ring}` (docs/module-layers.md: the log is a leaf every
//! module names, so it cannot name `diag`, which names the Plex layer). The third stays here:
//!
//! * [`zlib`] — `dlopen`'d `compress2` plus a gzip envelope, in its own one-symbol table.
//!
//! Logs and Cloud Lab diagnostics have ONE scrubber and take different exits from it. Native Sentry
//! envelopes are deliberately different data: `telemetry::native` applies a fixed JSON field
//! allowlist and path sanitizer before they enter the common consent-gated telemetry spool.

// UNGATED for the same reason `eventlog::scrub` is, and it is the same lesson: the guarantee this module
// provides is its TESTS — that action fields cannot carry runtime strings, that bounded context
// fields stay within their allowlisted schema, and that `PRIVACY.md` lists every usage event — and
// tests behind a feature the default gate does not build are tests that never run. `scrub`'s 31
// assertions sat unexecuted for as long as they existed.
