//! **The allowlist of usage events that may be reported off this television, as a TYPE.**
//!
//! `PRIVACY.md` promises that titles, ratingKeys, search terms, subtitle text, server names and
//! addresses are never sent. This file is what makes that a checkable statement rather than a
//! good intention for usage telemetry: every usage event is a variant of [`DiagEvent`], every field of every
//! variant is a number, a bool or a `&'static str` from a fixed table, and one exhaustive
//! serializer turns them into a wire record. **There is no field a caller can put a runtime string
//! into**, so a call site cannot leak one by accident the way `log(&format!(…))` could — which is
//! not hypothetical here, it is the bug the previous commit in this area had to fix by hand across
//! seven call sites.
//!
//! # Why an enum, and not the macro the plan first proposed
//!
//! The first design was `diag::event!(name, k = v, …)`, which stringifies an identifier at the
//! call site. That gives the *appearance* of an allowlist and none of the substance: any call site
//! could mint any event with any field, and "no free-text field exists in the type" was false
//! because there was no type. A reviewer caught it. One enum in one file, exhaustively matched by
//! one serializer, delivers the property the macro only claimed — and it is less code.
//!
//! # UNGATED, deliberately
//!
//! This module compiles in every build, including one with no telemetry feature at all, for the
//! reason `eventlog::scrub` was moved out of `lab/`: **its tests are the guarantee, and tests behind a
//! feature the default gate does not build are tests that never run.** That is not a hypothetical
//! either — `scrub`'s 31 assertions sat unexecuted for as long as they existed. What IS gated is
//! everything that would SEND one of these.
//!
//! # Adding a variant
//!
//! Three things move together and the tests fail if they do not: the variant, its arm in
//! [`serialize`], and its row in `PRIVACY.md`'s schema table. That last one is
//! [`the_privacy_document_carries_the_generated_table`], and it is the mechanism behind the promise that the
//! document is written *before* the thing ships rather than after.
//!
//! **A variant may not carry a `String`.** [`no_variant_can_carry_a_runtime_string`] greps this
//! file for one. If a new event genuinely needs text, it needs a bounded enum instead — that is
//! the whole design, and the answer to "but this one is safe" is that every leak in this
//! repository's history was written by somebody who had just finished thinking that.
