//! **The HTTPS media plane: a byte range of a remote file, pulled on demand.**
//!
//! [`nj_net::stream`] is a raw TCP socket that speaks cleartext to a host name or address of either
//! family. It is the right transport for a plaintext PMS, but it cannot carry an HTTPS origin.
//! LG's QA reviewers will not have a Plex Media Server on their LAN — they sign in with an account
//! we supply and stream from a server on the public internet, over https, at a `plex.direct`
//! hostname whose certificate is issued for that NAME. So the media plane needs a second
//! transport, and this is it.
//!
//! # What this module IS
//!
//! A **pull source**: [`CurlSource::read`], [`CurlSource::seek`], [`CurlSource::size`],
//! [`CurlSource::status`], [`CurlSource::abort`]. That is the entire surface, and it is the same
//! shape `stream.rs` presents to `ff.rs`'s AVIO callbacks, deliberately — `ff.rs` holds a source
//! enum and dispatches, and **never learns curl-multi mechanics**. Every `curl_multi_*` call, the
//! wake pipe, the header parse and the Range validation live behind this door.
//!
//! It is not a general HTTP client. [`nj_net::net`] is that, for the account/login calls, and it is
//! *blocking by design* — `curl_easy_perform` runs a whole request to completion. A media stream
//! is the opposite shape: it must deliver bytes as they arrive, be seekable by byte offset, and be
//! **interruptible at teardown**, which is what forces the multi interface here.
//!
//! # The libcurl contract is FROZEN to the OLDEST supported television
//!
//! This module's [`dynlib!`] table is a SECOND table, separate from `net.rs`'s, and that is the
//! whole point: [`nj_base::dynlib::load_into`] is **all-or-nothing**, so one missing symbol empties
//! the table it is in. If the multi symbols shared net's table, a television without them would
//! lose **plex.tv sign-in** — the app would not merely fail to play, it would fail to log in. Two
//! tables means a set that cannot stream over https can still sign in and browse.
//!
//! The table contains exactly seven names. `curl_multi_wait` has existed since curl 7.28.0.
//!
//! **`curl_multi_poll` and `curl_multi_wakeup` are BANNED here, and that is measured rather than
//! argued.** Probed on the dev television 2026-08-23:
//!
//! ```text
//! bound libcurl.so.5        (libcurl.so.4 absent)
//! libcurl/7.53.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2p zlib/1.2.11 c-ares/1.12.0 nghttp2/1.26.0
//! features=0x0029829d   →   AsynchDNS = YES,  IPv6 = YES,  SSL = YES
//! all seven symbols below PRESENT;  curl_multi_poll and curl_multi_wakeup ABSENT
//! ```
//!
//! Both of those resolve on the development Mac, which is exactly the trap the separate table
//! exists to survive: a symbol that is present where you test and absent where you ship.
//!
//! The **easy** half of the API (`curl_easy_init` / `_setopt` / `_cleanup`) is NOT duplicated
//! here — it is read out of `net.rs`'s already-loaded table. Those symbols are ancient and
//! universal; binding them twice would mean two tables that can disagree about which libcurl they
//! came from, for no gain. See [`easy_ready`].
//!
//! # Abort is a WAKE PIPE, not a short poll
//!
//! Teardown's contract everywhere else in the player is "set the flag, then join" — the main
//! thread aborts the AU lanes, fires one `shutdown(2)` at the demux socket, and joins the demux
//! thread. A curl transfer has no socket we own, so `shutdown(2)` has nothing to aim at.
//!
//! `curl_multi_wait` accepts application-owned extra descriptors, so this module creates a pipe
//! and passes the read end. Teardown sets the abort flag and writes one byte; the thread parked in
//! `curl_multi_wait` wakes at once, sees the flag, removes the easy handle and returns. That
//! preserves "set the flag, join" exactly — **without** the 10–100 ms floor a polling timeout
//! would put on every single teardown.
//!
//! Three details are contract, not implementation taste:
//!
//! 1. both ends are **`O_NONBLOCK` and `FD_CLOEXEC`** ([`Wake::new`]);
//! 2. the read side is **drained after every wake** ([`multi_wait`], and it is the only place that
//!    waits, so there is one drain site). A pipe left readable makes every subsequent
//!    `curl_multi_wait` return instantly and turns the loop into a spin — which passes every other
//!    test in this file and only shows up as burnt CPU in production. That is why
//!    `two_sequential_abort_cycles_each_block_until_signalled` exists;
//! 3. **be precise about what "immediate" means.** *Delivery* is immediate. *Observation* is
//!    immediate whenever control is inside `curl_multi_wait` — but on a libcurl with a
//!    SYNCHRONOUS resolver the thread can already be blocked inside `curl_multi_perform`, in
//!    `getaddrinfo`, where no byte in our pipe can reach it. The dev set reports `AsynchDNS = YES`
//!    (c-ares), so the window is much smaller than feared there, but that is ONE firmware.
//!
//! ## `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` — built on 2026-09-05, for a different reason than this doc once gave
//!
//! This section used to describe our own `getaddrinfo` plus `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` as the "designed
//! fallback for DNS cancellation, deliberately NOT built": with `CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL=1` and a
//! synchronous resolver libcurl cannot honour a timeout during name resolution, and pre-resolving
//! would have sidestepped that. Nothing measured that as needed, and it still has not been.
//!
//! What DID need it is offline play. plex.tv advertises the household's own server as an
//! `https://…plex.direct` name that only public DNS resolves, so a LAN with its uplink down could
//! not reach a server one hop away. `CurlSource::open*` now asks `net::resolve` for a pin by the
//! URL's host and port — recorded by the registry from the address plex.tv advertised beside the
//! name, validated in `plex::origin::ResolvePin` — and applies it as ONE `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` entry
//! on every easy handle it attaches. The hostname stays in the URL, so SNI and certificate
//! identity are untouched; libcurl simply never resolves it. There is no `getaddrinfo` here: the
//! address comes from plex.tv, never from a resolver of ours, so the second-resolution-path
//! objection above does not arise. The list is owned by the easy handle it was set on (see
//! `stop`), and a libcurl that answers `CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION` keeps resolving names itself.
//!
//! **TLS is strict, with one bounded exception (issue #378).** An open, reopen or seek whose strict
//! handshake failed with a date verify result (a television with no battery clock) is
//! repeated once on a fresh easy handle, recognising the server by the key `net::keypin` remembers
//! for that exact host and port, name check still on; see `start_range_until`.
//!
//! # Why the abort handle lives in a module-global REGISTRY
//!
//! [`abort_active`] is what `player::engine`'s teardown calls, and a reader's first instinct is
//! that it should take a handle instead — pass the `Arc<Abort>` up to the engine and drop the
//! global. That instinct is right about globals in general and wrong here, for a reason worth
//! writing down so it is not "simplified" back:
//!
//! * The `CurlSource` is **created inside the demux thread** (`ff::demux`), like the `AvioState`
//!   that owns it, because it must not exist at all on the plaintext path. The engine never holds
//!   it. `SHARED.hs_ptr` solves the same problem for `stream.rs` by having the ENGINE own the
//!   `HttpStream` box — an option here only if the engine constructed the curl source too, i.e.
//!   only by moving transport choice out of the demuxer.
//! * Handing the engine a handle instead means publishing it across a thread boundary after the
//!   thread starts. The registry closes that race with an [`OpenReservation`]: the demuxer
//!   publishes the wake target, then re-checks its already-engine-owned AU abort flag, and only
//!   then starts network I/O. Teardown must win one side or the other.
//!
//! So the registry holds an `Arc<Abort>` — atomics and two pipe fds, **no pointer into the
//! source** — and [`abort_active`] signals it under the same mutex that [`CurlSource::drop`]
//! deregisters under. There is no lifetime question left: the `Arc` keeps the pipe open for
//! exactly as long as anyone can signal it, and signalling is a non-blocking `write(2)`, so
//! holding the lock across it cannot block the main thread.
//!
//! One live media transfer at a time is the same assumption `SHARED.hs_ptr` already makes.
