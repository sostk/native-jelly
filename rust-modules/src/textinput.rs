//! textinput — the system on-screen keyboard, and the text it commits.
//!
//! Four calls wide: [`available`] asks whether this set has a panel, [`start`]/[`stop`] raise and
//! dismiss it, and [`drain`] takes what has been typed. The app draws no keyboard of its own — the
//! television draws it, over our surface, and hands the text back as ordinary SDL events.
//!
//! ## Why this is plain SDL and not a webOS call
//!
//! Stock `SDL_StartTextInput()` / `SDL_StopTextInput()` raise and dismiss the TV's own keyboard.
//! `SDL_webOS.h` misleads by omission — it has no keyboard entry point — but the backend is not in
//! the webOS extension API at all: it is inside LG's Wayland video driver.
//! `Wayland_CreateDevice` writes four real hooks into `SDL_VideoDevice`
//! (`WebOSHasScreenKeyboardSupport`, `Show`, `Hide`, `IsShown`), `SDL_StartTextInput` dispatches to
//! the second, and `WebOSShowScreenKeyboard` is a complete `text_model` IME client. Typed text
//! comes back as an ordinary `SDL_TEXTINPUT` event, so `app.rs`'s existing `SDL_PollEvent` loop
//! already sees it. moonlight-tv 1.5.8 shipped exactly this against the TV's own SDL.
//!
//! Linking is the plain `extern "C"` case, not `dynlib!`: all 14 firmware images in
//! `tools/fwcompat.py`'s inventories export the whole `SDL_*TextInput*` family. That says nothing
//! about whether the PANEL rises, though — those are stock public API in every SDL2 build — so
//! [`available`] probes at runtime rather than assuming.
//!
//! ## Three traps, all of them silent
//!
//! 1. **The event is shifted.** webOS inserts a `Uint32 inputSource` at `+12`, so the UTF-8 text
//!    starts at **+16**, not the `+12` the vendored `include/SDL2/SDL_events.h` declares. That
//!    header is stock 2.0.4 and lies about this build; the NDK sysroot's fork copy is the proof.
//!    Under `hostsim` the offset really is `+12` — desktop SDL2 is stock — so this is a `cfg`, and
//!    a single hard-coded number ships garbage on one of the two platforms. [`TEXT_OFF`] is that
//!    `cfg`; `decode_text_at` takes the offset as an argument so `make check` grades both.
//! 2. **`SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS` is a precondition.** `SDL_StartTextInput` shows the panel only
//!    `if (SDL_GetKeyboardFocus())` — the window carrying `0x200` — and our window is created
//!    `OPENGL | FULLSCREEN` with neither `SHOWN` nor a focus flag. If it is clear, SDL still
//!    enables text events and still returns void, so the panel simply never rises and nothing
//!    reports anything. Hence [`bind`]: the flag is logged at boot AND again inside [`start`], the
//!    moment it actually decides something.
//! 3. **A wedge we inherit**: the panel cannot be reopened after dismissal (moonlight-tv#435,
//!    reproduced on webOS 7.4). The community fix is in webosbrew's bundled SDL fork; we call the
//!    TV's own, so we get the bug with no patch. `SDL_SetTextInputRect` is a no-op here too —
//!    open and close, no positioning.
//!
//! Everything above was re-verified before it was written, against artefacts rather than memory:
//! `tools/fwcompat.py --lib libSDL2-2.0.so.0 --grep TextInput` (the family, on all 14 images),
//! the NDK sysroot's fork header (`inputSource`, hence `+16`), and `strings` over the real
//! television library kept in the gitignored `sysroot/usr/lib/` — which is SDL `2.0.5-83.gld4tv.15`
//! and does carry `text_model_interface`, `text_model_factory_interface`,
//! `WebOSShowScreenKeyboard` and `WebOSHideScreenKeyboard`. Note the `WebOS*` names are only
//! EXPORTED from webOS 7.4 on; on the dev set's 4.x they are internal, which is a property of that
//! build's symbol visibility and not evidence of absence.
//!
//! ## Do not fake the event with `SDL_PushEvent` (measured 2026-08-14)
//!
//! The obvious way to exercise this without a keyboard is to push a synthetic `SDL_TEXTINPUT`,
//! exactly as `app::remote_synth_key` and `remote_synth_ptr` push synthetic keys and clicks. **It
//! SIGSEGVs inside SDL**, with no Rust panic and no log line — `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`,
//! `KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x8`, backtrace `libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib SDL_PushEvent_REAL` →
//! `libSDL3.0.dylib SDL_PushEvent_REAL`. The Mac's `libSDL2` is **sdl2-compat forwarding into
//! libSDL3**, and SDL3's text event carries a `char *text` POINTER where SDL2's carries an inline
//! `char text[32]`; the compat layer dereferences it while converting the pushed event. Keys and
//! pointer clicks survive the same trip only because every field they use is a scalar. So
//! `app.rs`'s `txt:` token drives [`on_event`] directly, and what it proves stops one step short
//! of `SDL_PollEvent`'s own delivery.
//!
//! Two dead ends, so nobody spends a day on them again: the Luna route (only four
//! `com.webos.service.ime/*` methods, all in ACGs this app does not hold — it is granted
//! `["public"]`), and a physical USB or Bluetooth keyboard (`/dev/input` is not mounted into our
//! jail; `remote.rs` documents the general case).
//!
//! ## Text that ARRIVES correctly and DRAWS as boxes (measured 2026-08-23)
//!
//! This module is byte-transparent and the tests below pin that — a full-width `＼`, a CJK run and
//! a Hangul syllable all reach the query as themselves. **They then render as `.notdef` boxes**,
//! because `pkg/appfont*.ttf` is a SUBSET: 2853 codepoints, Latin + Cyrillic + Greek, with no CJK,
//! no Hangul and no full-width forms (`tools/cut-inter.py` cuts it; `text.rs` has no per-glyph
//! fallback — its `DROIDSANS` path is a whole-font last resort for a MISSING file, not a chain).
//!
//! So a reader debugging "my search shows boxes" can stop here: the text arrived, and the gap is
//! the font, one layer down. It is recorded in this module because this is where that question
//! gets asked first, and because it is the half of LG checklist rows #15/#16 that no amount of
//! correctness in this file can answer — the rows are about what is ON THE PANEL, and a Korean or
//! Japanese query is unreadable in the field, in the "No results for …" line, and anywhere else the
//! query is echoed. Fixing it is a font decision (a wider cut, or a real fallback chain), not a
//! text-input one, and it is not in this module's gift.
