//! **The spool file: one owner, and the races that owner exists to make impossible.**
//!
//! [`queue`](super::queue) is the pure half — framing, caps, acknowledgement, all of it bytes in
//! and records out. This is the impure half: which file, who may touch it, and in what order. The
//! split is the same one `queue`'s own doc argues for, and it is what lets the interesting failures
//! (a power cut mid-write, an append racing a compaction) be *tested* instead of reasoned about.
//!
//! # There is exactly ONE writer, because the obvious cheap fix is a worse bug
//!
//! Queuing an event used to be a read-modify-write of the whole file, on the frame loop, per event.
//! The obvious repair is to append instead — and appending, on its own, silently LOSES records:
//! the flush worker rewrites via temp+rename, so an appender that opened the file before the rename
//! writes into an inode nobody will ever read again, and the record disappears when the fd closes.
//! No error, no log, nothing to grep for.
//!
//! So every read, append and rewrite goes through [`LOCK`], and the flush's commit **re-reads the
//! file under that lock** rather than writing back the snapshot it sent from. Both halves are
//! needed and they fix different halves of the same race: the lock keeps an append from landing in
//! an orphaned inode, and the re-read keeps a record appended *during* the network send — which is
//! the whole point of a send being slow — from being erased by a commit that predates it.
//!
//! # The lock is not held across the network
//!
//! A flush can block for [`sender`](super::sender)'s whole timeout. Holding the mutex across that
//! would park the main thread on the next event for twelve seconds, which is the freeze this module
//! is trying to avoid, arriving by the door marked "correctness". The protocol is therefore three
//! steps — snapshot under the lock, send with it released, commit under it again — and
//! [`commit_retiring`] is what makes the third step safe.
//!
//! # One path per process
//!
//! The candidate list is a SEARCH ORDER, for [`nj_base::paths`]' reason: which of the two `/media`
//! directories is writable depends on the jail profile. But a search order applied independently to
//! reads and writes is a split brain — read the file that exists, write the first that accepts, and
//! on a set where those differ every record written is invisible to the next read. Resolved once,
//! cached, preferring a spool that already exists over one that merely could.
