//! **The Sentry wire envelope, hand-rolled** — parse a DSN, frame an envelope, budget it.
//!
//! Sentry Native is now linked for the one job hand-written code cannot do after death: an
//! out-of-process ARM stack walk. Its HTTP transport is compiled out. This file remains the only
//! wire implementation, so SDK crash events and hand-built panic/fallback events use the same
//! consent-aware spool, retry rules and CA-verified POST. The newline-delimited format stays pure
//! and host-testable without a network.
//!
//! **Everything here is pure.** A DSN goes in as a string, bytes come out. There is no socket, no
//! endpoint and no credential in this file — which is what lets the whole format be tested against
//! a synthetic DSN on the host, months before anyone has an account, and what will keep those tests
//! meaningful afterwards.
//!
//! # The failure modes this exists to make impossible
//!
//! Every one of these silently produces a 400 from a server that tells you nothing useful, which is
//! why they are asserted rather than trusted:
//!
//! * **the item header's `length` must be the payload's BYTE length**, not its character count and
//!   not off by the trailing newline. A wrong length makes the receiver read the next item's
//!   header as payload;
//! * **`event_id` is 32 lowercase hex characters with NO dashes**. A dashed UUID is rejected;
//! * **a retry reuses the original `event_id`**, or a flaky link manufactures duplicate issues out
//!   of one crash;
//! * **the compressed item limit is 200 KiB**, not the 1 MiB decompressed figure that gets quoted.
//!   Budgeting against the wrong one means the payload is refused exactly when a crash was
//!   interesting enough to carry a lot of context.
//!
//! # What is NOT here
//!
//! The send. It needs a CA-verified unpinned POST and a DSN, and both live in [`super::sender`] —
//! which is why this file's tests need neither.
//!
//! # The sender exists, and one item here sat uncalled straight through it
//!
//! This header used to read "the only non-test caller of any of this is the sender, and the sender
//! is the next commit", with an `#[allow(dead_code)]` on every item. The sender landed and the
//! attributes did not move — so when [`envelope`] turned out never to be called, its attribute read
//! as an accurate note about work not yet done rather than as the alarm it was. The bare event went
//! to the envelope endpoint for as long as that lasted, and the endpoint answered `200`.
//!
//! What is still uncalled is deliberate and says so per item. `consent`'s header already warns that
//! a stale allowance hides a dead function; this file is the other polarity, and the worse one — it
//! hid a LIVE one that should have had a caller.
