//! **The spool: records that survive the crash that produced them.**
//!
//! A telemetry record is written when a television is in trouble and sent when it is not, and the
//! gap between those two moments routinely contains the thing worth reporting — a crash, a SAM
//! kill, somebody pulling the plug because the picture froze. So the queue is on disk, and the
//! interesting questions are all about what a half-finished write looks like afterwards.
//!
//! Everything in this file is pure: bytes in, records out. The disk is [`super::spool`], which owns
//! the file and the one lock every read and write goes through; the worker is
//! `telemetry::flush_soon`; the sender is [`super::sender`]. That split is what lets a power cut be
//! *tested* rather than argued about.
//!
//! # Four of these tests were fake, and the tests are the whole deliverable
//!
//! Written and green on the first run, then broken deliberately to see which caught it: the two
//! `MAX_RECORD` tests both passed with that guard deleted (the bounds check caught one, the CRC the
//! other), and both CRC tests passed with the CRC deleted (serde rejected the corrupted JSON before
//! the checksum was consulted). Four green assertions grading nothing. The replacements corrupt a
//! record's base64 body **into another valid base64 character**, so the length is honest, the JSON
//! parses, and only a checksum can tell — and the oversized-frame case is built with a correct CRC
//! so nothing else about it is wrong. All fifteen have since been watched red against the specific
//! line they exist for.
//!
//! # The framing, and why it is not JSON-per-line
//!
//! Each record is `[u32 len][u32 crc32(payload)][payload]`, little-endian, payload being JSON.
//!
//! A newline-delimited log would be simpler and would be wrong in one specific way: a partial write
//! that happens to end at a newline is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a complete one, and a partial write
//! that ends mid-object is detected only by a JSON parser, which fails identically for "torn" and
//! "written by a newer build". The length lets a torn tail be recognised before anything is parsed;
//! the CRC catches the case the length cannot — a record whose bytes were written but not the ones
//! we meant, which is what a filesystem with a reordered journal hands back.
//!
//! # What a corrupt record does to the ones after it
//!
//! It ends the queue. [`decode_all`] stops at the first record that does not verify and reports the
//! remaining bytes as dropped, rather than hunting for the next plausible header.
//!
//! That is a deliberate choice against resynchronisation, and the reason is that resync cannot be
//! made safe: a `len` field is four arbitrary bytes, so scanning forward for "a header that looks
//! valid" will eventually find one inside a payload, and the record it then decodes is
//! attacker-shaped garbage that passes CRC because the CRC was read from the same garbage. Losing
//! the tail of a spool is cheap. Reporting a fabricated record is not.
//!
//! # The cap that matters is BYTES
//!
//! Both are enforced, but a record count is the weaker one: a crash record carrying registers, a
//! maps line and breadcrumbs is orders of magnitude larger than `app.launch`, so "200 records" is
//! not a size. The byte cap is what keeps this off a 615 MB partition shared with every other app.
//! Crash/error records have priority over usage records; within each category the newest survive.
//! **A `OneOff` record is highest priority of all** — it is a report a person explicitly pressed
//! Send for, on the one screen it was offered, and there is no re-offering it if this trim drops
//! it (unlike Errors/Usage, which the next crash or the next route re-produces).
//! The dropped count is
//! returned rather than swallowed, because a queue that silently discards is a queue whose numbers
//! are wrong in a direction nobody can see.
