//! **Telemetry: the decision, the spool, and the worker that drains it.**
//!
//! The pieces have one ordering. [`consent`] and its storage are the part that has to be right
//! before anything can be collected or sent and are answerable entirely on the host. [`sentry`]
//! and [`posthog`] are the wire FORMATS; [`playback`] is the closed handled-error schema. Their
//! failures are silent 400s from a server that explains nothing, so they are pinned to tests while
//! there is still no network to hide behind. [`queue`] is the framing and caps, pure; [`spool`] is
//! the file those bytes live in and the one owner every read and write goes through; [`sender`] is
//! the socket, and the place the credential split decides which project this build reports to.
//! [`incident`] is the closed onboarding-failure schema, sent either as a standing report or — to
//! somebody who was never asked, or said Yes before it existed — as a one-off on an explicit press,
//! whose bounded transport is [`oneoff`]. Either one's Report ID is watched in [`delivery`], which
//! the flush, the spool and the one-off fallback all settle, so the screen can say "sent" only once
//! a server accepted it. [`classes`] is the closed vocabulary [`playback`] serialises, owned here so
//! the player classifies INTO it rather than this layer naming the player; [`transition`] is what a
//! consent change does to the resources this module keeps.
//!
//! **Ungated**, like `eventlog::scrub` and `diag::schema`, and for the reason both of those record: the
//! guarantees here are the tests — that no identifier exists before an opt-in, that withdrawal
//! destroys what it withdrew, that the event path fails closed, that a record queued while a flush
//! was on the network is not erased by that flush's commit — and a test behind a feature the
//! default gate does not build is a test that never runs.
