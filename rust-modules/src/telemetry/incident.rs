//! **Onboarding incidents for Sentry: a failed sign-in, discovery, save, locked read, profile
//! switch or first content load, as one closed handled-error report.**
//!
//! Consent is asked after a successful sign-in, so a television whose onboarding FAILS has never
//! been asked anything — the population behind issues #75 and #76 is exactly the one the standing
//! error channel cannot see. An incident therefore has two ways out, and [`ConsentKind`] tags which
//! one produced a report:
//!
//! * **Standing** ([`report_standing`]): error reports are on at [`ONBOARDING_REPORT_SCOPE`] or
//!   above — the person opted in on a build that disclosed this report. Spooled on the Errors lane
//!   with the crash-report id, like `telemetry::playback`'s handled error; its event id is shown
//!   as the Report ID too.
//! * **One-off** ([`send_one_off`]): anybody else, and only after they press Send on the report
//!   they were shown. No identifier of any kind; the event id is the receipt they can quote.
//!
//! Which of the two applies is `consent::report_permission`'s answer, not this module's.
//!
//! **Every value accepted here is closed or bucketed.** An [`IncidentKind`], a [`LinkClass`] built
//! from the network layer's own evidence, bucketed counts and durations, a clamped code
//! generation, a persistence failure class, and — on the two discovery verdicts that need it —
//! per-route HTTPS outcome classes, closed facts about a verified plaintext answer
//! (`plex::probe::InsecureEvidence`) or a bucketed resource count. The only raw integers are the HTTP status, the
//! `CURLcode` and the storage service's own error code — numbers with no identity of their own.
//! There is no free-text slot at all: no error or caption string (a profile-switch message embeds
//! the profile's title), no PIN, code, token, account, profile or server name, URL, hostname or
//! address. `every_body_is_closed_and_carries_no_identity_or_content_slot` walks every body shape
//! to keep it that way.
//!
//! Ported and generalised from 0.6.6's `telemetry/signin.rs`, which reported sign-in failures only.
//! Its free-form storage outcomes are replaced by closed persistence/helper stages,
//! keymanager stages and a bounded array of candidate errno numbers (never candidate paths).
