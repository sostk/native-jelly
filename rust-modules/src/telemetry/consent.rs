//! **The decision, and the identities that only exist because of it.**
//!
//! Two independent switches — errors and usage — both off until somebody turns them on, plus ONE
//! random identifier PER SWITCH, each minted by that switch's opt-in and destroyed by that switch's
//! withdrawal. Everything in this file is either a pure transition over a [`Consent`] value or the
//! storage under it, so the compliance-critical half is host-tested and needs no television and no
//! vendor.
//!
//! # The three rules that shape it
//!
//! **Nothing is stored to enable telemetry before consent.** Only the decision itself and the
//! policy version it was given against. In particular no identifier: [`apply`] mints one on the
//! transition into a channel's consent, never for the other channel, never at boot or "just in
//! case", and [`no_identifier_exists_before_anyone_says_yes`] is the test that keeps it that way.
//!
//! **Two identifiers, because they are two channels.** The crash-report id (`errors_id`) exists so
//! that Sentry can count how many uninterrupted opt-ins an issue reached rather than how many
//! times it fired — its built-in "users affected" reads exactly `user.id` and nothing else. The
//! analytics id (`install_id`) is PostHog's `distinct_id`. They are never the same value and never
//! travel together: a person who consented to two purposes did not consent to having them joined,
//! and one shared handle is precisely the join. Withdrawing one channel destroys ITS id and leaves
//! the other untouched. **Signing out destroys both and the decision with them**
//! (`telemetry::forget`, behind `auth::forget_account`): consent belongs to the account that gave
//! it, and the next account to sign in is asked afresh.
//!
//! **Two switches, because they are two questions.** Error reports and usage statistics are judged
//! differently by the people who care — when Audacity retreated it dropped usage analytics and kept
//! error reporting — and bundling them into one "analytics?" toggle is the shape that reads as a
//! trick. Two `bool`s, both defaulting to false, and consenting to one says nothing about the other.
//!
//! **Withdrawal DELETES the identifier**, and that is a change from the plan this was built to,
//! forced by a measurement. The plan said keep the id, request deletion from the vendor, and rotate
//! only once that succeeded. Neither vendor can delete anonymous data belonging to no account
//! (`PRIVACY.md` term 7 records why), so "keep it pending a deletion" would be keeping it forever.
//! Dropping it locally is the one thing this app actually controls: it severs any future opt-in
//! from everything sent before, so a person who turns it off and later back on is a new install
//! rather than a resumed profile.
//!
//! # What must NOT happen on the event path
//!
//! [`allows_usage`] is called from `diag::event`, which is reached from the frame loop. It reads a
//! cached snapshot and never touches the disk or a lock. That is not an optimisation — it is the
//! bug this crate already shipped once: wiring the scrubber's identity list to `session::peek()`
//! put five file reads on every log line and deadlocked the whole `auth` test block. The fix there
//! and the design here are the same: the writer PUBLISHES, the hot path reads a snapshot.
//!
//! # The four `#[allow(dead_code)]`s are gone
//!
//! [`POLICY_VERSION`], [`should_ask`], [`apply`] and `telemetry::record` carried one between them,
//! each naming the consent SCREEN as the missing caller. `screens::consent` is that screen (it
//! was `ui::consent` when this was written; phase 5b moved it and deleted the old module), and the
//! attributes were deleted by the commit that added it rather than left behind — which was the
//! stated plan and is worth having actually happened, because a stale allowance is how a genuinely
//! dead function later hides in plain sight.
