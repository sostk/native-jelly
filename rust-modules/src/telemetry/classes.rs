//! **The closed vocabulary of a handled playback-error report.**
//!
//! Every value [`super::playback`] serialises is a member of one of these enums, and every
//! enum's `code` is the wire string, written out and never derived from a variant name, because a
//! rename is a refactor and must not silently re-partition a year of dashboards. The telemetry
//! layer owns the schema; `player::report` is the producer that classifies a live playback into
//! it, and `player::FailureKind::class` is the one conversion from the player's own failure enum.
//! Nothing here names the player, the route layer or the ABR controller: a constructor that needs
//! one of their types (a `QualityClass` from a `route::Quality` or an `abr::Rung`) is a function
//! of the producing layer.
//!
//! Pure data and pure bucketing, so every boundary is graded on the host. The producer's own tests
//! (`player::report`) pin the boundaries through its re-exports of these types.
