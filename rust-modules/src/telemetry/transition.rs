//! **The live side effects of a consent transition.**
//!
//! The app's owner decides a transition (`previous` -> `next`, or the end of an account's tenure)
//! and hands both sides over; this module is what the decision does to the resources telemetry
//! itself keeps: the published snapshot, the held sign-in events, the in-memory playback trace, the
//! spool, the native crash backend and the persisted record. `app::adapters::consent::
//! ConsentAdapter` calls it for the live case and records fixture effects instead for the rest.
