//! **The sender** — the one place in this app that talks to somebody who is not Plex.
//!
//! Ties the three pure halves together: [`queue`](super::queue) holds records, [`sentry`] and
//! [`posthog`] frame them, `net::post_ca` puts them on the wire. Everything interesting about it is
//! about *not* sending — when there is no consent, no configuration, no network, or a server that
//! has asked us to stop.
//!
//! # Configuration is compile-time and OPTIONAL, which is what makes "cannot send" checkable
//!
//! The DSN and the PostHog project key arrive through `option_env!`, set by the Makefile out of the
//! gitignored `pkg/telemetry.local.json`. A checkout without that file compiles to `None` and
//! [`configured`] is `false` at COMPILE time — there is no endpoint in the binary to reach, so a fork,
//! a CI runner and anyone building from source get an app that provably cannot report, without
//! having to trust a runtime flag.
//!
//! Both values are **write-only ingest credentials and publishable by design** — every client that
//! sends anything must carry one. The Sentry *auth token*, which can read and delete the project's
//! data, is a different thing entirely and is never compiled in: it lives on the dev Mac and is used
//! by `sentry-cli` to upload debug files.
//!
//! # The three ways this refuses, in order
//!
//! 1. **No consent.** Checked per record against its own category, not once for the batch — the two
//!    switches are independent, and a spool written before a withdrawal can still contain records
//!    of a category that is now off.
//! 2. **No configuration.** See above.
//! 3. **A server that said stop.** A `429` holds the whole spool rather than dropping records —
//!    being rate limited is not being rejected, and treating it as rejection loses exactly the
//!    reports that arrive in a burst, which is what a bad release looks like.
//!    **The INTERVAL a server asks for is not yet honoured**: `net::Resp` carries no headers, so
//!    [`retry_after_secs`] is written and tested but cannot be fed, and a hold is a flat
//!    [`DEFAULT_HOLD_S`]. Said here rather than left to be discovered, because "honours
//!    Retry-After" is the kind of claim that reads as true from the presence of a parser.
//!
//! # What is pure here, and why that is most of it
//!
//! [`classify`] and [`retry_after_secs`] decide everything: whether a record is done, should be
//! kept for later, or is hopeless. They take a status and headers and return a verdict, so every
//! rule below is a host test rather than a claim — which matters because the alternative is
//! discovering the rule from a dashboard that stayed empty.
