//! **What became of a watched report, per event id.**
//!
//! A report the person can quote a Report ID for — an onboarding incident, standing or one-off —
//! is WATCHED here from the moment its lane takes it, and every place that decides its fate says
//! so against its event id: the flush (`super::process_records`) when a server answers or a record
//! is retired unsent, the spool (`super::spool`) when its cap or a withdrawal discards one, and the
//! one-off's bounded direct fallback (`super::oneoff`). The session adapter reads [`state`] once a
//! frame and hands each change to the incident owner, so "sent" on screen means a server accepted
//! it and nothing less.
//!
//! Only watched ids are tracked: [`settle`] updates an entry and never creates one, so the flush
//! can report every record it touches without the table growing past [`MAX_WATCHED`].
//!
//! [`forget`] ends the departing account's claim on all of it: it bumps the tenure counter — which
//! a one-off append and its fallback worker are fenced by — and clears the table, so a stale
//! worker cannot publish into the next account's states.
