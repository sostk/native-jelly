//! 57.89.100 / 55.58.100); we link stub `.so`s carrying those SONAMEs and the device

//! This module is THE media demuxer: robust MKV/MP4/TS demux, HTTP input, and
//! index-based seeking (av_seek_frame). Design record: docs/ffmpeg-demuxer-plan.md.
//! It also owns the ONE encode path (`venc`, near the end of the file): the dev

// television's own FFmpeg and every webOS release ships a different one (55 / 57 / 58 / 59 / 60
// across webOS 2 to 11). They are plain constants again because the app now ships its own
// FFmpeg: exactly one version exists, under a SONAME that cannot collide with the TV's, and
// `ci/ffabi-assert.c` holds every number here against the very headers the shipped libraries
// were built from.
//
// That is the point of bundling. An offset that is merely *probably* right — derived from a
// version string plus an upstream tarball — becomes one the compiler checked.
//
// `tools/ffabi-dump.sh` re-derives all of them if the bundled version ever changes.
//
// **TWO TABLES, and the axis is POINTER WIDTH rather than FFmpeg version.** The 32-bit arm is the
// television; the 64-bit arm is the desktop simulator (`make sim`), which runs this same code
// against a host build of the SAME FFmpeg 9.0 from the SAME `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` component list.
// Every difference below is a pointer that got wider or an int64 that moved to keep its
// alignment; nothing here is a version difference, which is exactly why the old runtime
// major-selected table does not come back. `ci/ffabi-assert.c` holds both, `#if`-ed the same way,
// against each build's own headers — so a wrong number is a compile error on the platform it is
// wrong for, and `HOST=1 tools/ffabi-dump.sh` prints the 64-bit half.

//
// ABI strategy (workflow-verified 2026-07-24 against the DEVICE's own libs — the
// AVOption tables inside libavcodec.so.57.89.100 carry the true field offsets):
// every numeric encoder knob goes through av_opt_set ("b"/"g"/"bf"/"maxrate"/
// "bufsize"/"dct"/"time_base"), pix fmts come from av_get_pix_fmt() at runtime
// (AV_PIX_FMT_RGBA is 28 in THIS build — an FF_API_XVMC alias shifts the enum;
// never hardcode it), and only width/height/pix_fmt (AVCodecContext) and
// data/linesize/width/height/format/pts (AVFrame) are raw offset pokes below.
// After avcodec_open2, avcodec_parameters_from_context round-trips the values
// through the already-modeled AVCodecParameters as a runtime ABI self-check —
// a mismatch latches the whole mpeg path off instead of corrupting memory.
// mpeg1video only accepts the fixed MPEG1 frame-rate table: time_base stays
// {1,30} regardless of the actual (jittery, <=30fps) capture cadence; jsmpeg in
// streaming mode ignores timestamps and decodes as data arrives.

// by name now, so the constants are gone with the last read of them. Which is the point: all three
