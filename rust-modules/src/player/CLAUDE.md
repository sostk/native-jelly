# player/ — the buffer-feed video engine

This is the in-process **buffer-feed** playback engine (was `src/playback.c`): it pulls the part
stream, demuxes it to access units, and `Feed()`s them to LG's StarfishMediaAPIs while `libAcbAPI`
binds the decoded sink to the hardware video plane. The Starfish/ACB calls cross into C at the seam
`src/starfish.c` (outside this dir — edits there almost always pair with edits here); the **ABI and
bind-order gotchas for that seam live in THIS file**, below. `docs/agent-reference.md` carries only the
one-paragraph playback summary.

## Pipeline

In-process is the point: ACB can only bind an app-owned sink, which the earlier URI/out-of-process
path (`com.webos.media/load`, `start_playback()`) could not provide — that path is kept only as
dead-ish reference, and `docs/buffer-feed-plan.md` records the pivot (treat it as history, not
spec). The stream side: `PMS HTTP GET` → demux → per-lane access-unit
queues with byte-cap backpressure (`aq.rs`) → the pump `Feed()`s each AU to the Starfish pipeline.
The demuxer is **`ff.rs` — the libavformat the app BUNDLES (not the TV's), over a custom AVIO on
one of TWO transports** (design record: `docs/ffmpeg-demuxer-plan.md`; the hand-rolled `mkv.rs`
fallback is retired/deleted). **Which transport is decided in `ff::demux` from the part URL's
scheme, or by a plaintext open's redirect to https (`stream::redirect` hands that hop to curl)** —
`AvioState` holds a source enum and `read_cb`/`seek_cb` dispatch: `http` → `stream.rs`'s raw socket, `https` → `crate::curlio`. That matters *here* because teardown is a
different mechanism per arm: `engine::teardown` fires `stream::http_shutdown` at the socket **and**
`curlio::abort_active()` at the curl source's wake pipe, since a thread parked in `curl_multi_wait`
is not one any `shutdown(2)` of ours can reach. Exactly one of the two ever has anything to do. Ours ships beside the binary as `libav*-plx.so.*`, is `dlopen`'d by absolute path
and pinned to majors 63/63/61, and is built `--disable-network` with `file` as its only protocol —
so the AVIO is not merely how bytes reach it today, it is the only way they *can*. See the root
`docs/agent-reference.md` linking section for why. It
emits Annex-B video AUs (param sets prepended at each keyframe) and AC3/EAC3, ADTS-framed AAC, or DTS core audio frames,
and seeks by time via `av_seek_frame` (libavformat's own Cues index).

## Threading model (this is the whole ballgame)

- `engine.rs` — the **main-thread-confined** session object. All ACB/Starfish *control* calls happen
  on the main thread; `engine` spawns the workers below.
- `pump.rs` — the **main-thread pump** (was `bufferfeed_pump`): each frame it drives bind → Play →
  feed and services seeks.
- `threads.rs` — the workers beside the demuxer: **`load_thread`** (construct Starfish + `Load()`,
  which owns its own GMainContext) and **`timeline_thread`** (the ~10 s `/:/timeline` progress
  reporter). The **demux thread body is `ff::demux`** (spawned by `engine::start_bufferfeed`): open
  the part URL, read+convert packets, push AUs to the two lanes; **and service seeks** — it
  `av_seek_frame`s on `seek_to_ns` between two `av_read_frame` calls, which is the whole seek
  mechanism (nothing interrupts it; see the seek gotcha below).
- `shared.rs` — the engine's cross-thread transport, callback and clock state (each field replaces a
  C `volatile` global — `g_*`). Route ownership and route-changing intents are the separate
  process-wide authority in `route::PLAYER_CONTROL`. Put new state under the owner whose invariant
  it belongs to; never smuggle it through a raw static.

**The main-thread rule is compiler-enforced.** The seam is the `VideoSink` trait in `nj_platform::tv::sink` (`rust-modules/platform/src/tv/sink.rs`)
(Starfish-shaped: one method per verb, reached through `player::sink()`). `ffi.rs`'s `extern "C"`
declarations are private to that module and only `StarfishSink` there implements the trait on the
television; `ffi_host.rs`'s `HostSink` is the simulator's. Every method but three takes a
`task::MainThread` — a `!Send` ZST the application mints once. Since phase 9 it mints exactly one
and `boot` MOVES it into `player::adapter::PlayerAdapter` (`App.adapters.player`), which also owns
the native session that was the `static mut ENGINE`: the seam is reached as `pa.mt()`, the session as `pa.engine()` / `pa.split()`, and a function that
touches the session takes `pa: &mut PlayerAdapter` where it used to take `mt: &MainThread`. Moving
any of it onto a thread stops compiling (the closure captures a `&MainThread`, which `task::spawn`
rejects), and two live `&mut` to the session no longer needs a convention — it does not compile,
which is what turned `pump`'s "reload REPLACES the ENGINE, so `eng` dangles" comment into a rule
the borrow checker keeps. Two intentional holes, both worth knowing: `load` takes **no** token
because `load_thread` runs it off-main by design, and `MainThread::assume()` is callable — so an
`unsafe` block inside a worker still defeats this. The rule for new code: take the token **iff**
you reach the seam, the adapter **iff** you reach the session, so a signature keeps meaning
something.

## Gotchas that bite (all verified in code)

- **C-from-C++ Starfish calls** go through `extern … __asm__("<mangled>")`. Each Load gets a fresh,
  16-byte-aligned `SfSlot` whose `object[65536]` is constructed in place by the ctor symbol. Slot
  addresses are never reused or freed: a late firmware callback carries only that address, so a
  retired slot stays in the registry until process exit. Call the destructor only through the
  gated teardown path and **never** hand the object to C++ `new`/`delete` (its real size is unknown).
  Methods returning a `std::string` use a hidden sret first-arg; read the `char*` at offset 0 (SSO)
  for short replies like `"Ok"`/`"BufferFull"`.
- **Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos have their own document: `docs/dolby-vision.md`.** A DV node is
  emitted only after the boot-time configd probe definitely confirms hardware support. The route
  freezes that capability + presentation decision, and every Load/reload/recovery consumes the
  stored presentation rather than re-reading the later cache; `dvnonode` is the logged diagnostic
  exception. Atmos routing and ACB forwarding are independent and unchanged. The payload evidence,
  Profile 5 one-tick fix and instrument traps live in that document.
- **The Load's `adaptiveStreaming` ceiling is derived per session (`engine::sink_envelope`), and
  it was a 4K60 constant for EVERY codec until 2026-09-03 — which on webOS 10 refused every H.264
  stream: `docs/webos10-resource-allocation.md`.** Lab-measured 2026-08-27 on release 10.3.1: the
  pipeline allocates against the DECLARED ceiling rather than the bitstream, so the Load came back
  `num=601 Resource Allocation Error`, while the identical envelope carrying `"H265"` played in the
  same session, and a 1920x1080 H.264 declaration loaded in 117 ms. The rule now is exactly that
  measurement and no more: HEVC keeps 4K60; H.264 declares 1920x1080@60 when the session's widest
  raster (`route::sink_max_raster` — source for direct play, the ceiling for a fixed quality, the
  catalog's widest feasible actuator for Auto, since a rung commit never re-Loads) fits FHD, and
  stays 4K60 otherwise; the device table's per-codec row (`devcaps::Caps::{h264_row,hevc_row}`,
  frame rate included) clamps it only when the table was actually read. The `load:` line carries
  `max=WxH@F`, the pipeline echoes what it was handed as `smp_cb type=5`, and the pipeline tier
  grades both (`load_max`, `sink_echo`). **Also since 2026-09-03: a `type=18` before any picture
  publishes `load_failed`** (`sf_on_event_inner`), so an asynchronous refusal reaches the failure
  read-out instead of parking the player in Connecting on a black screen (lab report §3.5).
  **And the frame rate IS a discriminator, measured on the dev set the same day:** a 4K H.264 24p
  direct play declared at 60 makes the pipeline announce `frameRate:24` and then `:30` for the same
  stream (a 24p picture on a 30 fps lattice — the judder the maintainer saw on the Auto 4K rung);
  declared at 24 or 30 it announces 24 once and holds it — and the sink's displayed-frame counter
  measured the picture: **13.0 fps presented under the 60 declaration, 24.1 under 24**. So H.264
  declares the stream's rate class
  (`fps_class`), HEVC keeps 60 (4K HEVC under 60 holds 24), and a transcode with no known rate
  keeps 60. `/tmp/nativejelly-sinkmax=WxH@F` overrides the envelope for the legs still unrun on
  10.3.1.
- **There IS a presented-frame instrument now, and it is not a GStreamer trace.** The payload's
  `streamQualityInfo` / `streamQualityInfoNonFlushable` keys make libpf read the video sink's
  `dropped-frames` / `non-flushable-displayed-frames` properties on the same 200 ms timer as the
  position tick and forward them as callback types 46 / 47 (decompiled from libpf
  `CustomPipeline::updatePeriodicalInfo`, 2026-09-03). They land in the event log as
  `smp_cb type=47 num=<frames shown in the last poll>` (per-interval on this firmware, ~5 at 24p)
  AND, normalised for the numbering shift (46/47 here are 48/49 on webOS 5+ — `sink_counter_kind`),
  as `sink: displayed=<n>` / `sink: dropped=<n>`, which is the line the harness reads;
  `tests/run.py::presented_fps` turns them into the `presented:` characterisation line every
  synthetic case prints. Codec-agnostic — it is the instrument `dualsequencer:6` was only for
  Dolby Vision. Type 46 is emitted only when non-zero, and a stream shown at 13 fps reported 0
  drops: the sink does not count a frame it never presented as dropped.
- **A constructed Starfish object is not dispatchable until synchronous `Load` returns.**
  `sf_ready()` still answers whether the object exists; `sf_ready_object()` also requires the
  C `LOAD_RETURNED` gate. Rust records the return on the exact native epoch before publishing
  the route result. The pump waits before even polling `sf_is_load_completed`, with separate
  20-second issued→return and return→loadCompleted budgets. Timeout has code `load_timeout`;
  firmware refusal remains `tv_pipeline`. Teardown after that timeout does NOT join a media
  thread still inside `sf_load` (that froze the SDL thread on BACK): the thread, payload and
  epoch are parked as `engine::AbandonedLoad` (Rust phase `Abandoned`), native starts are
  refused, and `reap_abandoned_load` runs the ordinary Unload → gate → retire → D1 release on the
  main thread once Load returns; a Load that never returns leaks its object. A Load that has not
  timed out is still joined. The host concurrent tests model this boundary, not
  the firmware's native initialization. ACB dispatch is additionally constrained by stage/bind
  ordering; the C Starfish gate does not wrap ACB calls.
- **A claimed retranscode HOLDS presentation for its worker's flight (`claim_hold.rs`).** The PMS
  half of a track pick / enhancement toggle / quality change runs on a worker for 1-15 s and the
  landing reloads at the offset captured at claim time, so a stream left playing showed the
  flight's seconds twice. `pump` calls `claim_hold::engage` when the claim dispatches `Pending`
  (the viewer's own `player::pause`, then `player::state()` answers `Buffering` so the HUD's
  existing transport spinner draws) and `take` + `release` AFTER `run_claim_tail`, so an accepted
  claim's Play lands on the new stream and a rejected one's on the kept Engine. A viewer press
  (`player::lifecycle::set_transport_paused` -> `note_user_transport`) forgets the restore: the
  viewer's last transport press always stands. A stream already paused at claim time stays paused.
  While the hold's pause stands the viewer's transport reads see PLAYING (`player::lifecycle::viewer_paused`,
  `claim_hold::owns_pause`): the OK toggle means Pause and a seek's `resume_if_paused` leaves the
  hold alone (its seek is carried past the reload by `pump::commit_or_carry_seek`, including a
  seek pressed mid-flight when none was pending at claim time). An engine failure during the
  flight publishes `Failed` at once (`fail_current_engine`) and clears the hold, so the error
  read-out shows instead of a spinner. The encoder a claim replaces is NOT stopped by the worker:
  the pump retires it (`route::retire_superseded_encoder`) after the reload.
- **The k5lp/k3lp sandbox preflight refuses native playback when `/dev/rtkmem` is unreadable.**
  The device fact is cached at boot, while the refusal belongs to `PlaybackSession` and clears
  on exit. Explicit Repair confirmation spends `Player.repair` once for the whole app lifetime;
  `PlayerAdapter` owns the worker receipt. Success still requires a full app relaunch. See
  `docs/native-video-sandbox.md` for limits.
- **Starfish `Load` must be constructed with `uid = NULL`** (`SMP_ctor(slot->object, NULL)`), and in
  buffer-feed mode the app must **not** `LSRegister` its own `com.webos.media` client — either
  collides with the pipeline's uMS connection (CONN_FIND_ERR). See the comment in `load_thread`.
- **ACB bind order matters** (mirrors Kodi/ss4s): `setSinkType(MAIN)` → `setMediaId` →
  `setState(LOADED)` → *wait for decoded frames* → `setMediaVideoData(<sourceInfo envelope
  VERBATIM>)` → `setDisplayWindow` → `setState(PLAYING)`. The payload passed to
  `setMediaVideoData` is the **whole `sourceInfo` envelope** captured verbatim from the pipeline's
  callback (`sourceInfoRaw`), not a reconstructed one. Audio is owned by the pipeline — **never feed
  ACB an audio SINK or elementary stream**. That half is real and unchanged. Its long-stated
  consequence is not: `SOUND_ERROR_019` is a literal that exists in **no library on this
  television** (swept across ~70 harvested libraries including 92 MB of Chromium), and the clause
  has carried no evidence since the initial commit. **`AcbAPI_setMediaAudioData` IS used**, for a
  two-key METADATA descriptor — `{"audio":{"immersive":"ATMOS"},"context":"<mediaId>"}`, fired
  right after `acb_bind`, which is exactly where LG's own client fires it. Device-measured
  2026-08-21: `rv=1`, audio untouched (1600 AUs, `reply=O`, no error), and the set's own
  "Dolby Vision / Dolby Atmos" read-out captured on screen. Details and addresses:
  `acb_send_atmos` in `src/starfish.c`. `AcbAPI_setMediaVideoData`/`setState`/
  `setDisplayWindow` take a `long *taskId` out-param as their last arg — the 3-arg ABI is required
  (2-arg calls corrupt memory / segfault).
- **The Load payload's codecs must come from the `/decision` OUTPUT, not the source file.** A
  transcode changes the codec/rate; building the Starfish Load config from the *source* metadata gives
  the decoder the wrong description → **silent audio / glitches**. Read the output codecs from the
  transcode decision. For ADTS/HE-AAC, use the **CORE** sample rate from the AudioSpecificConfig (SBR
  doubles it). See `[[audio-payload-codecs]]`.
- **Subtitles are client-rendered here — the TV's HW subtitle engine is URI-mode only** and
  unreachable in buffer-feed. Plain text and image (PGS/VobSub) subs are decoded and drawn by
  us; styled ASS/SSA uses the bundled libass worker (`ass.rs`, `ass_source.rs`) with original
  headers, events and attached fonts. Sidecar ASS keeps the complete script rather than requesting
  a SubRip conversion. Don't expect the pipeline to burn or overlay them. See `[[tv-subtitle-engine]]` and the `plex/`
  soft-subs note. An image sub's rect coords are in **the subtitle stream's own authoring canvas** —
  1920×1080 for Blu-ray PGS but 720×480/576 for a DVD VobSub rip — so `ff::sub_canvas` reads that
  canvas off the decoder (via `avcodec_parameters_from_context`, no raw struct offset; the ABI proof
  is in its doc comment) and `appkit::player_hud::sub_screen_rect` scales the whole display set into the
  video rect. Assuming 1080p unconditionally is what made VobSub render as a corner postage stamp.
  **An EXTERNAL text subtitle (the `.srt` beside the film) is a third producer, `sidecar.rs`:** the
  demuxer never sees it, so it is fetched whole from PMS, parsed, and looked up by time from its OWN
  store — not `SHARED.sub_cues`, which is a window the demuxer refills and a backward seek would
  empty. On a conversion it draws the server's extracted file when the negotiation delivers the
  subtitle `External`, and is silent when the conversion burns it (`route::client_renders_subtitle`;
  `docs/jellyfin-playback.md` "Subtitles").
- **A seek NEVER interrupts the demuxer.** The pump publishes the target in `seek_to_ns` and the
  demux thread — the only thread that touches the `AVFormatContext` — `av_seek_frame`s on it
  between two reads. Do not reintroduce an interrupt: the pump used to `shutdown(2)` the socket to
  break the read so the outer loop would reopen and seek, and it could not work, because our AVIO
  is **seekable** (`seek_cb` reopens with a byte `Range`), so libavformat treats the broken read as
  recoverable, calls `seek_cb`, gets a fresh connection at the same offset and reads on.
  `av_read_frame` never returns an error, so the reopen never happens and the seek never lands —
  it just runs out the stuck-watchdog on pre-seek packets and escalates to a full reload. This
  survived a long time because the test suite's cases inherited a server-side `viewOffset`, so the
  seek under test usually had nowhere to go (fixed 2026-07-28; see the
  `docs/agent-reference.md` testing note).
- **Seeks are in-place** (Kodi-style): flush + `av_seek_frame` to the target,
  then on the first post-seek keyframe `feed_stream` re-anchors the GStreamer segment
  (`setTimeToDecode` + `sendSegmentEvent`) — no reload/decoder re-init. A transcode seek instead
  restarts the encode at `&offset` with a full fresh `Load`. The rebase machinery
  (`pts_shift`/`rebase_pending` in `shared.rs`) keeps Starfish from ever seeing a PTS jump.
- **`frames` is SEEK-scoped, `seen_frame` is SESSION-scoped.** `pump` zeroes `SHARED.frames` as
  *part of applying* an in-place seek (it counts only post-seek frames, for the rebind + resume
  re-pause gate), so `frames == 0` does **not** mean "we have never shown a picture" — it is true
  for the whole of every seek. `SHARED.seen_frame` is the bit that answers that question: set beside
  `frames` in the presented callback, cleared **only** in `reset_session`. The HUD divides its two
  busy indicators on it (`appkit::player_hud::busy_surface`); anything else asking "has this session put
  a picture on the panel" wants `player::seen_frame()`, not `frames() > 0`.
- **App-switch lifecycle** (handled in `app/run.rs`, the frame loop; the machine and the
  transport-pause contract are `player/lifecycle.rs`, which `app::lifecycle` re-exports; details in
  the `docs/agent-reference.md` gotchas): OS
  background suspends the buffer-feed preserving the session. Foreground tracks one exact Load
  attempt at a time, follows reducer-approved superseding or rollback attempts, retries an exact
  failure without repeating route preparation, and applies the saved clock only after `Started`.
  Preserve the suspend/reload pairing if you touch playback.

## Verifying playback changes

**Start with `make check`** — the host unit suite (`cargo test --lib`, ~28 s for 3,639 tests,
measured 2026-09-17; do not re-quote that number, `time` it) covers a real
slice of this pipeline's pure logic: `ff.rs`'s `nal_end` bounds guard and AVCC→Annex-B conversion,
the AVIO abort guards (a seek after teardown must not open a second connection — graded on an accept
count), `stream.rs`'s socket lifecycle, `route/plan.rs`'s direct-play-vs-transcode selection, and
`task.rs`'s `MainThread` token being genuinely `!Send`. Cheap enough that there is no reason to skip
it before a deploy.

But there is **no host *runtime*** — nothing above decodes a frame or touches Starfish/ACB (`ff.rs`
once gated `#[link]` directives out of `cfg(test)` to keep the pure logic host-testable; with
everything on `dynlib!` those are gone, so a test that actually calls FFmpeg now fails by taking
`dlopen`'s `None` branch on Darwin rather than by failing to link), and the host is Darwin while the TV is
Linux, which is why `tools/sockprobe.c` exists. So anything about *playback behaviour* is only
observable on device: deploy and read `/tmp/nativejelly-events.log` (feed stats, bind steps,
seek/rebase, `RECEIVE_GOOD_VIDEO`). The `tests/` harness drives real playback per case — see the root
`docs/agent-reference.md` testing section (run as GUEST by default; never run two harness jobs at once).
