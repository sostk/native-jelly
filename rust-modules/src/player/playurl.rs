//! The `nativejelly-playurl` trigger: a stream to play and the Load payload declaration to play it
//! with, parsed beside the one module that acts on it ([`super::engine`]'s `start_bufferfeed`).
//!
//! It is a TYPED dev trigger. Its value is a JSON object whose decision half is a
//! [`crate::metadata::Dovi`], so it can live neither with the trigger primitives (`nj_base::devtrig`
//! is a base-layer module and names no application type) nor in `crate::dev` (the application
//! layer, which the player may not name). It is parsed here from `nj_base::devtrig::read`, and a
//! release build still folds it away at COMPILE time exactly as before: `read` is `None` without
//! the `devtriggers` feature, so [`playurl`] answers `None` and no declaration can be injected.

/// A stream to play and **the Load payload declaration to play it with**, with no library item
/// behind it — `/tmp/nativejelly-playurl`, the player-PIPELINE test tier's one entry point.
///
/// This is the trigger that makes the pipeline testable without Plex. `nativejelly-url` already
/// hands the engine a URL, and everything downstream of it — `stream.rs`, `ff.rs`, `aq.rs`, the
/// pump's `Feed()`, the ACB bind — is byte-identical to a real playback. What it CANNOT do is say
/// what the stream *is*: the Starfish `Load` payload takes its codecs from `route::stream_vcodec`
/// / `stream_acodec`, and its Dolby nodes from `stream_dovi` / `stream_immersive`, all five of
/// which are normally installed together by `route::apply_plan` from a PMS decision and replaced
/// together by later route transitions. So a URL-fed 4K HEVC file was declared to the television
/// as whatever the route happened to hold — in a fresh boot, the empty string, which falls through
/// [`crate::player::engine`]'s `_ =>` arm to `"AC3"` and an H264 payload. The declaration is
/// precisely what governs HEVC-vs-H264 payload selection, the `"AC3 PLUS"` naming trap, and both
/// Dolby nodes, so a tier that cannot set it cannot test them.
///
/// JSON, whole-file, one object. Chosen over a `key=value` line for three reasons: the DV node is
/// nested, `serde_json` is already a dependency and `crate::dev::DevServer` is the established precedent for
/// exactly this shape, and JSON contains no apostrophes — which matters because `tests/run.py`
/// writes triggers through a single-quoted `printf` with no escaping.
///
/// ```jsonc
/// {"url":"http://192.0.2.10:8020/pipe_hevc_eac3_4k_dovi_p8.mkv",
///  "vcodec":"hevc", "acodec":"eac3", "fps":23.976,

///  "atmos":false}
/// ```
///
/// Deliberately **not** `Debug`, for `crate::dev::DevServer`'s reason one step removed: `url` is a free
/// string, and while the pipeline tier's own URLs carry no credentials, the field is the same
/// shape as `route::url()` — which for a real playback carries `X-Plex-Token` in its query. A
/// derived `Debug` is how that reaches a log the day someone points this trigger at a PMS part.
