//! player::engine — the main-thread-confined session object (Engine) + lifecycle
//! (acb_init / start_bufferfeed / stop_bufferfeed) + the feed loops. No worker
//! thread ever names an Engine field: race-free by confinement (like the C

//! That confinement is **enforced, not just asserted**: the slot is `App.adapters.player`, a

//! `&mut PlayerAdapter` borrow is what confines it now (see `player::adapter`). Which is also the

//! run on the main thread too and deliberately do not take one: they only publish to `SHARED`.

// BUFFERSTREAM Load payloads (ss4s shape). Video-only for the local sample path;
// video+AC3 for streaming. Copied VERBATIM from playback.c.
//
// `@APPID@` is substituted by `with_app_id` at the single choke point every variant passes
// through. It is a PLACEHOLDER rather than the literal it used to be because two installs can now
// sit on one television (`paths::app_id`), and a developer build announcing the SHIPPED app's id
// would be a false statement to the media pipeline about which application it is.
//
// WHAT THIS FIELD IS ACTUALLY FOR IS NOT KNOWN HERE, and the distinction matters because the two
// app ids this app sends travel different paths into different libraries:
//
//   * the ACB id (`acb_create` -> `AcbAPI_initialize`) has real evidence behind it. LG's own
//     `libcbe` keys media metadata on `{"appId":…,"pipelineId":…}` — recovered from this
//     television's binaries, `docs/dolby-vision.md` §3 — so the id reaches a subsystem that reads
//     it. What it does with it there is still inferred, not traced.
//   * `option.appId` in the Load payload, this key, has NOT been traced into `libpf` at all.
//     `tools/fwcompat.py` is a symbol inventory and a JSON key path lives in `.rodata`, so no tool
//     in this repository can answer it; `.agents/skills/decompile-tv-lib/` is the only route, and
//     `docs/two-installs.md` §7 states the question rather than an answer.
//
// So: sending the true id is the conservative move on a field whose consumer is unknown, not a fix
// for a mechanism anyone here has read. The failure it guards against — if it guards against one —
// is a black video plane with working audio and no error line anywhere, which is why it is worth
// making correct by construction rather than finding out on a television.
//
// A placeholder rather than `format!`-ing the constant: `with_window_id` splices `option.windowId`
// onto this exact key, and deriving both from one source is what makes it impossible for the
// anchor and the payload to drift apart. For the shipped app the composed bytes and the key order
// are identical to what every release so far sent — asserted in the tests below, because the
// webOS 5+ splice path is one this project's 4.5 dev set cannot exercise.

/// frame's tone mapping. `lcm(3,4) = 12` frames is **0.5005 s**, which is the period of the

///
/// Measured on this set, uninstrumented, 85 s of Profile 5: 340 misses, and **340 of 340** equal

/// 8: 170}` and nothing else. It is a derivation that reproduces the data with no free parameter,
/// not a fit.
///
/// The repair is to hand the pipeline a PTS whose truncation lands in the right bin. The loss is
/// the fractional nanosecond FFmpeg's rescale already dropped, so it is strictly less than 1 ns,
/// and **one** nanosecond recovers it. The upper bound is `100000/9 ≈ 11111 ns` — beyond that an
/// already-correct frame would be pushed a tick the other way — so 1 sits at the safe end of a
/// wide range. As an A/V offset it is nothing: 1 ns against a 41.7 ms frame.
///
/// **Video only.** The key is computed from the video buffer's own PTS; the audio lane never
/// reaches this code and shifting it would be a skew for no reason.
///
/// **THE SIGN WAS BACKWARDS, AND −1 IS THE FIX.** Read the history below for what was tried; the
/// short version is that the model was right about the mechanism, wrong about which side rounds,
/// and the device settled it. Measured with LG's own level-2 KADP logging armed mid-playback
/// (`tools/logmprobe`): for **38 of 40** misses the key written into the LUT ring is exactly the
/// key the display firmware requested **plus one**. The ring is a tick HIGH, so the fed PTS goes
/// DOWN. Alternating unseeked legs, same title, same binary:
///
/// ```text
///   nudge = -1   misses 1        nudge = 0   misses 81
///   nudge = -1   misses 1        nudge = 0   misses 81
/// ```
///
/// Reproducible, 81:1, and the arithmetic that predicts −1 also predicted +1 would help; +1 was
/// measured at 163/165 against 164 for zero — i.e. inert. **Trust the measurement here, not the
/// derivation**: our fed PTS is not passed through, the pipeline re-timestamps by NEAREST-rounding
/// on the 1001/24000 lattice (measured: alternating −0.333/+0.333 ns against the exact rational),
/// so exactly how one nanosecond on our side moves a tick on theirs is not something this comment
/// can honestly claim to model. What it can claim is 81:1, twice, with the scene controlled by
/// alternation.
///
/// # The history, kept because three of its steps were wrong and each cost a run
///
/// **AND THE DEVICE REFUTED THE FIRST ATTEMPT, which is why the default was 0 for a while.** The one step
/// the disassembly could not settle was whether the OTHER side of that exact-equality comparison
/// moves with us. It does. Controlled A/B, same title, same seek to 900 s, same 45 s window, only
/// this value differing: **nudge 0 → 118 misses, nudge 1 → 230**. Worse, not fixed. A constant
/// offset cannot repair a *relative* truncation difference when both sides derive from the same
/// fed timestamp — which is now measured rather than assumed, and which also retires the tidiest
/// explanation this investigation has produced.
///
/// What survives the refutation is the arithmetic, and it is not small: 340 of 340 misses in the

/// `{4, 8}` mod 12 and nothing else. So the key IS computed that way and the comparison IS exact.

///

/// `primed: v=1999ms a=1962ms -> Play` was eventually printed with EXACTLY the fed extents of the
/// segment that had landed 94 seconds earlier — so the condition Play waits on had been satisfied
/// the whole time and was simply never EVALUATED.
///
/// The evaluation lived in one place only: inside [`feed_stream`]'s per-AU loop, after each
/// `sf_feed` — accepted or not, which was a second bug in the same lines. A pump tick runs the video lane and then the audio lane
/// ([`super::pump::pump`]), so when a whole HLS segment lands at once the video lane drains all of
/// it with `abuf` still at zero — `vbuf` tops out below [`PRIME_VIDEO_MAX_NS`] and the
/// `abuf >= PRIME_AUDIO_NS` arm cannot be true yet. The audio lane then fills, but it deliberately
/// carries no prime check. On every later tick `aq_pop` returns null and the loop breaks BEFORE
/// the check is reached. Play is now waiting for a video AU that only the next segment can supply.
///
/// That is why direct play is unaffected and HLS is not: direct play trickles AUs in over many
/// ticks, so audio keeps pace and the check passes on an ordinary tick. A segment arriving whole
/// is the shape that breaks it — and since [`PRIME_VIDEO_MAX_NS`] is 2500 ms, a 2-second segment
/// can never take the video-only escape, which makes this structural for every 2 s-segment reload
/// rather than a rare race.
///
/// **This test drives the real [`feed_stream`] and [`feed_audio_lane`] against the real host feed
