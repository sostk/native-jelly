//! **Playback lifecycle events joined by one attempt.**
//!
//! `requested -> started -> failed|ended|abandoned`, or
//! `requested -> failed|cancelled|abandoned`. The interesting number is the gap between requested
//! and a terminal outcome: `started / requested` is the startup success rate without leaving a
//! silent unresolved bucket for "it just sat there".
//!
//! The error-consent channel also keeps a separate sparse, typed trace in memory across reloads of
//! this same attempt. It queues exactly one handled Sentry event only if the derived state reaches
//! `Error`; ordinary low quality, buffering and rejected ABR candidates remain breadcrumbs at most,
//! never errors of their own.
//!
//! # These are TRANSITIONS, not log lines
//!
//! The first design put `playback.started` on the engine's `load:` line. That line is the wrong
//! seam and the name would have been a lie: it is emitted BEFORE the source is opened and before
//! anything plays, so a television that never produced a frame would report a start. It is
//! `requested` now, and `started` fires on the first transition into `Playing` — the same value the
//! HUD renders, so the event says what the viewer saw.
//!
//! # Observed at the DERIVED state, not at `pump::set_state`
//!
//! `set_state` looks like the choke point and is not: [`super::state`] derives two of its answers
//! outside `pb_state` entirely — `Resolving` while a plan is in flight, and `Error` for a
//! `/decision` refusal, which happens before an engine exists and so before the pump has ever run.
//! Hooking the setter would have silently missed the earliest and most certain failure there is.
//! So this observes the value the HUD reads, once a frame.
//!
//! # Once each, and only for a REAL end
//!
//! `Playing` is re-entered after every seek and every reload, and `Error` can be republished on
//! consecutive frames; the latch is what makes each event mean "this attempt", not "this frame".
//! And `ended` fires on a genuine teardown only — a seek, an ABR rung change and an app-switch
//! suspend all end an ENGINE without ending a playback, and counting those as endings would make
//! the completion rate a measure of how often people scrub.
