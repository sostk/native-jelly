//! The player's transport-pause contract and its app-switch lifecycle machine.
//!
//! `ForegroundLifecycle` is a tested `State + Event -> Effects` machine, and the transport helpers
//! (`paused`, `viewer_paused`, `set_transport_paused`, ...) are the one door every surface reaches
//! the player's pause through. All of it describes the PLAYER's transport and its resume after an
//! OS suspend, and the player machine ([`super::machine::Player`]), the detail page's trailer
//! transport ([`super::preview::transport`]) and the claim hold ([`super::claim_hold`]) all name
//! it, so it lives here rather than in `app::lifecycle` (a layer above the player). The loop's
//! adapter for it, `PlayerForegroundActuator`, needs `app` state and stays in `app::lifecycle`,
//! which re-exports everything below so app code spells the names it always did.
//!
//! Moved out of `app/lifecycle.rs` verbatim in module-layer step L12 (a pure move; the
//! `RESUME_REWIND_NS` constant came with it from `app/mod.rs`, and `resume_if_paused` from
//! `app/playback.rs`).
