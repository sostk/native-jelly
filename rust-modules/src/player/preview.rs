//! Background trailer preview. Shares the engine, not the session services: no PlayQueue, no
//! timeline reporter, no scrobble. Watch-state writes are the promise that is kept. `/decision`
//! still creates Activity, which is a server write and is not a watch-state write.
//!
//! **Interaction, once the picture is up and the viewer presses UP.** The detail page stays
//! mounted and there is no route change — the player route never adopts this engine. ALL of the
//! page's chrome fades to zero, the action row included, and the page draws a trailer transport
//! in its place (`screens::detail::trailer`): the `Trailer` kicker over the item's title, the
//! playbar and the state read-out, drawn from `appkit::player_hud`'s own pieces. What a trailer does
//! NOT get is the rest of the HUD — no quality, subtitle, audio or Info control, no tabs and no
//! track menus: a preview has no PlayQueue, no timeline reporter and no watch state, and a
//! control that writes one has no business on it. OK and PLAYPAUSE pause and resume it
//! ([`transport`]); the controls auto-hide on the HUD's own linger and any key brings them back.
//! BACK and DOWN collapse the mode back to background autoplay. A second dwell on an item that
//! has a trailer starts from the beginning again. None of the cache facts is a replay suppressor.
//!
//! **LEFT/RIGHT scrub, through this machine's own admitted path — not `player::request_seek`.**
//! Every non-in-place seek path in `player::engine` falls back to `reload_at` — a fresh Starfish
//! `Load` — which is exactly why this used to be refused outright: an un-admitted reload spends a
//! 64 KiB slot outside [`CYCLE_BUDGET`]'s accounting, and a reload that then fails would be
//! observed as an admitted-Load failure, arming the process-wide breaker and ending trailer
//! autoplay for every later item in the session. [`seek`] closes both halves of that hazard rather
//! than routing around it: [`Machine::admit_seek`] counts the reload against [`CYCLE_BUDGET`] the
//! moment `reload_at` actually issues it (mirroring [`admit`](Machine::admit)'s own timing), and
//! [`Machine::fail_admitted`] does not arm the breaker for a failure that lands after this
//! session's first picture — a seek that goes wrong inside a trailer that already proved it plays
//! is a LOCAL failure (this preview stops, [`view`] goes back to [`View::STILL`], and
//! `screens::detail`'s own `!view.picture` rule falls the page back out of full-trailer mode),
//! never a reason to disable autoplay for the rest of the session. **Budget exhaustion is the
//! conservative case**: [`seek`] refuses before calling `reload_at` at all and the trailer keeps
//! playing exactly where it was — a seek is a nice-to-have on a preview that still has no watch
//! state to protect, and the budget is shared with every later item's autoplay, so it is not worth
//! spending one of the last slots on it. `seek` never calls `player::request_seek`: no
//! `route::note_user_seek_intent`, no `report::note_seek_for(playback_trace_generation())` — a
//! preview has no trace generation, and the watch-state promise this file opens with covers a
//! seek exactly like every other write. Pausing has none of this to begin with: it is
//! `player::pause`/`resume` on a live engine, and `TX.reset()` on a real stop clears the flag, so
//! a collapsed or ended preview cannot strand it.
//!
//! Sound stays on. The bound Starfish surface has no mute. The Settings toggle is the only
//! sound control, and that is a platform limit.
//!
//! **Cycle budget is source arithmetic, not a measured leak.** Spike 0a never produced a delta.
//! `sf_load` keeps a 64 KiB slot (`src/starfish.c`) and the conservative RSS headroom cited by
//! the plan is about 958 KiB (`ui/frame/render_set.rs`). 958 / 64 is 14.96, so the ceiling is 14
//! admitted Loads, under the ratio rather than on it. Do not quote 14 as a television result.
