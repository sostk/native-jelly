//! **The Player machine** — the playback state `App` owns (restructure spec §2.2, phase 9).
//!
//! Everything about a playback that is a DECISION rather than a resource lives here, in one value
//! with one owner. Before phase 9 the same state was two `static mut`s and a scattering of loop
//! locals: `route::decision::SESSION` (the resolved route, the stream URL, the transcode session,
//! the HUD strings and the Up Next queue) and `App.foreground` (the app-switch lifecycle). Neither
//! could be handed to a function, so "who may write this" was a comment — `MAIN THREAD ONLY` —
//! rather than a signature, and the compiler had nothing to check.
//!
//! It is a MACHINE, not an adapter: no OS handle, no FFI, no thread. The Starfish/ACB session
//! object and its `MainThread` token are the ADAPTER's
//! ([`crate::player::adapter::PlayerAdapter`]), and the two are deliberately separate fields of
//! `App` so a screen or a pump can be handed the decisions without being handed the pipeline.
//!
//! # The tick
//!
//! [`Player::now_ms`] is this frame's millisecond stamp, set ONCE per iteration by the loop from
//! the same `fr.now` every other phase of the frame reads (spec §4.1: "Every integrator takes the
//! tick from its event"). It is the only clock this machine has, and it exists so that
//! `PlaybackSession::auto_last_switch` — the adaptive controller's "how long since the last
//! visible rung change" — is stamped from the frame tick rather than from a clock read taken at
//! whatever depth of the call stack happened to need it. `crate::player::vclock_ms()` was the
//! interim source; a second reader of a second clock is exactly how two stamps of "now" in one
//! frame come to disagree.
