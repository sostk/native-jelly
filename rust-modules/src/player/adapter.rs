//! **The Player ADAPTER** — the native session object and the main-thread token that confines it
//! (restructure spec §2.2, phase 9).
//!
//! An adapter holds OS/FFI resources and never logical state; the decisions live one field away in
//! [`crate::player::machine::Player`]. What this one holds is the [`Engine`] — the Starfish/ACB
//! session, its HTTP stream box, its AU queues and the handles of the three worker threads that
//! read raw pointers into all three — together with the [`MainThread`] token.
//!
//! # Why the slot moved here, and what replaced the token argument
//!
//! Until phase 9 the slot was `static mut ENGINE: Option<Engine>`, reachable only through four
//! accessors that each took a `&MainThread`. That argument was the enforcement: the accessor
//! handed out a `&'static mut` to a `static mut`, a second caller on another thread is instant UB,
//! and `static mut` carries no `Sync` bound to stop one (verified by compiling the counterexample
//! — see `docs/async-model-decision.md`).
//!
//! The reasoning is unchanged and the enforcement is stronger. **The token is now CONSUMED at
//! construction** ([`PlayerAdapter::new`] takes it by value, and `nj_run` is the only place that
//! can mint one), so holding a `&mut PlayerAdapter` IS the proof the old argument stood in for —
//! and it is a proof the borrow checker keeps rather than one a caller could satisfy twice. Two
//! live `&mut` to the engine no longer requires a convention: it does not compile.
//!
//! The rest of `player/engine.rs` keeps its `mt: &MainThread` parameters unchanged. They gate a
//! DIFFERENT thing — the ACB/Starfish seam (`tv::sink::VideoSink`'s methods, whose bind order is a
//! sequence of calls with no locking behind it) — and that surface is not this module's.
