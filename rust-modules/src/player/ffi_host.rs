//! The `hostsim` stand-in for `src/starfish.c` — the television's media seam, absent.
//!
//! This file has two behaviours and the default is still the honest failure.
//!
//! # Default: nothing decodes, and it says so immediately
//!
//! The simulator has no StarfishMediaAPIs, no `libAcbAPI`, and no hardware video plane. Every verb
//! reports the same failure the seam itself reports when a television has no usable video path
//! (`vp_mode() == VP_NONE`, `sf_load` returning 0), which is a state the engine, the pump and the
//! HUD already handle — a real firmware can be in it, and issue #22 was exactly that. So pressing
//! Play in the simulator lands on the app's genuine full-screen failure read-out rather than on a
//! hang or a panic.
//!
//! **The alternative was worse.** Stubbing these as no-ops that return SUCCESS would have the pump
//! wait forever for frames that never arrive, and a simulator that silently hangs on Play teaches
//! an agent that playback is broken when it is merely absent. Failing honestly and immediately is
//! the whole contract of that path.
//!
//! # Opt-in: a REFUSED Load (`nativejelly-refuseload[=N]`)
//!
//! With the sink armed, refuse the first N Loads (bare flag: every Load) the way webOS 10.3.1
//! refused the 4K60 H.264 envelope — asynchronously, by callback, after `Load()` returned ok=1.
//! See `sf_load`. It exists so the failure read-out that refusal reaches can be driven and
//! screenshotted on a Mac, and so a rollback that reloads can be made to fail a second time.
//!
//! # Opt-in: the CLOCK SINK (`nativejelly-clocksink`)
//!
//! **It accepts access units, throws them away, and advances a presentation clock at real time.**
//! Nothing decodes and nothing is displayed. What it makes runnable on a Mac is everything
//! upstream of the decoder: the PMS decision, HLS parsing, the AVIO transport, `ff.rs`'s demux, the
//! AU queues and their byte-cap backpressure, the feed-ahead throttle, the ABR controller's
//! transactions, seek and PTS rebase.
//!
//! **Why that is worth having, stated as what it can and cannot decide.** The reachable reserve is
//! `B_max = lead + queue_bytes / rate`, and every term in it is OURS — `AQ_VIDEO_BYTES`,
//! `AQ_AUDIO_BYTES`, `MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS`, `AUDIO_SLACK_NS` — not Starfish's. `abr/sim.rs` models
//! that analytically and has never once been checked against a running pipeline; this is the only
//! way to check it without a television. It can also answer whether the queues drain as modelled,
//! whether a rung transaction costs what `abr: tx` says, and whether backpressure behaves.
//!
//! It cannot answer anything about LG's decoder: resource-allocation refusals, the ACB video-plane
//! bind, the Load payload's Dolby declaration, `SOUND_ERROR_019`, frame pacing, or which codecs
//! the panel takes. A Mac decodes things that television will not and the reverse, so "it played
//! here" transfers nothing. **Every heartbeat already carries `sim=1`; nothing measured through
//! this sink is a device measurement, and a number taken here must never be quoted as one.**
//!
//! **Why a clock and not AVFoundation.** `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` is a genuinely close
//! analogue of Starfish's buffer-feed mode and would decode for real — but the questions it would
//! newly answer are about Apple's decoder, and the ones that break this app are about LG's. The
//! pixels are not the uncertainty. This is ~1% of the work for the part that is.
//!
//! It reports [`VP_EXPORTED`](super::VP_EXPORTED), the webOS 5+ path, because that one binds video
//! through an exported window id and never touches ACB — so the whole ACB stage sequence stays
//! skipped rather than faked.
//!
//! # How it is reached
//!
//! The verbs below are private; [`HostSink`] is the simulator's own `tv::sink::VideoSink`, one
//! method per verb, installed by `port.rs` for the `hostsim` build and returned directly by
//! `player::sink()` in the hostsim tests. The `*_for_test` hooks stay here, next to the statics
//! they touch, and the tests reach them as `crate::player::ffi_host::<hook>`.
