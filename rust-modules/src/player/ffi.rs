// Own Rust mirror of src/starfish.h, written from the public ABI contract.
//! player::ffi — the starfish.c seam (sf_* / acb_* verbs). These stay C (the mangled-C++ + ACB
//! ABI). The library thread calls back into our sf_on_event / acb_on_event (defined in mod.rs).
//! Signatures mirror `src/starfish.h` exactly; `long` is 32-bit on the arm target -> c_long.
//!
//! **Everything here but `load` takes a [`MainThread`]**, because the seam has no locking of
//! its own: the ACB bind order is a bare call sequence, and `sf_feed` races the pump's own
//! bookkeeping. The raw declarations live in a private `sys` module so the token is the only way
//! to reach them — a `use super::ffi::sys` from elsewhere in `player/` does not compile, which is
//! what makes this a guarantee rather than a note.
//!
//! The wrappers are the methods of [`StarfishSink`], the television's `tv::sink::VideoSink`; the
//! port table installs it (`port.rs`) and `player::sink()` reaches it. They stay `unsafe fn`,
//! one-for-one with the declarations. Several take raw pointers, and the pointer-free ones still
//! carry ordering preconditions the C side does not check (`acb_start` before the bind completes,
//! `sf_play` after `sf_destroy`). Calling any of them remains something to think about; the token
//! only says *where* from.
//!
//! This module is not compiled for the `hostsim` build or for host tests: the simulator's own
//! `VideoSink` is `player::ffi_host`, so the test binary references no Starfish externs at all.
