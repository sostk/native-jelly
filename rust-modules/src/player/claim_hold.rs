//! **Presentation hold while a claimed retranscode's PMS half is in flight.**
//!
//! A track pick, an enhancement toggle or a quality change is reconciled on a worker
//! (`route::execute_retranscode_claim`), which takes 1-15 s for its `/decision` round trip while
//! the current stream keeps PLAYING. The landing then reloads at the offset the claim captured, and
//! PMS encoded from that offset, so the viewer watched the seconds of the flight a second time.
//!
//! The fix is to stop presentation at claim time, through the ONE pause the viewer's own Pause key
//! uses ([`super::pause`]), and give it back at landing whichever way the claim settled. The
//! spinner is the HUD's existing busy mark: [`super::state`] answers `Buffering` while a hold is
//! live, and the transport slot already draws its `Working` glyph for that.
//!
//! **A viewer's transport press wins.** The viewer owns the transport; the hold is a loan. Any
//! press that reaches `player::lifecycle::set_transport_paused` calls [`note_user_transport`], which
//! keeps the spinner (the claim is still flying) but forgets the restore, so a Pause the viewer
//! pressed during the flight stays paused after the landing and a Play they pressed keeps playing.
//! The hold's own pause and resume call [`super::pause`]/[`super::resume`] directly and so never
//! count as a viewer press.
