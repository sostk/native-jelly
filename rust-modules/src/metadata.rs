    ///   catches P7: measured live 2026-08-21, the dev server's P7 item reports `bl_compat = 6`,
    ///   which sails through any `== 0` check.
    /// - **no cross-compatible base layer** (Profile 5 / `bl_compat == 0`) — IPT-PQ, which an
    ///   HEVC decoder will happily decode and a panel will happily show, incorrectly.
    ///
    /// **Silence must not convict, and that is the whole subtlety here.** Every field is 0 both
    /// when the server omits it and when there is no Dolby Vision at all, so a bare
    /// `bl_compat == 0` would refuse direct play for *every ordinary SDR file in the library*.
    /// `present` guards the outer question and a KNOWN `profile` guards the compat-id test, so a
