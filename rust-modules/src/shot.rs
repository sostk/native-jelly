//! Simulator screenshots — the host analogue of `tools/capture-screen.sh`.
//!
//! An agent driving the simulator needs to LOOK at the result, and it has no television to point a
//! capture service at. This reads the frame back off the GL front-of-swap buffer and writes a PNG.
//!
//! PNG specifically, and not the BMP/PPM that would need no encoder: an agent's file-reading tool
//! renders PNG and JPEG, and a format it cannot display is a file nobody looks at. The encoder is
//! already a dependency — `image` is in the crate for poster DECODING, and its `png` feature
//! carries the encoder too, so this costs no new crate.
//!
//! Deliberately not a general capture subsystem. `capture.rs` is that, it streams over TCP, and it
//! stays the answer for a live view. This is the one-shot an automated run needs: boot, settle,
//! write a file, optionally exit.
//!
//! Environment, read ONCE at first use (the whole app reads its dev config at boot by contract —
//! see `dev.rs` — and this runs before every swap, so re-reading it per frame would be both
//! against that convention and pointless work):
//!   NJ_SHOT=<path>          where to write (default: `shot.png` in the instance root)
//!   NJ_SHOT_FRAME=<n>       ALSO capture automatically at presented frame n (default: no
//!                                  automatic capture — only the `shot` token fires one)
//!   NJ_SHOT_SETTLE=<ms>     ALSO capture automatically once the screen has been at REST for
//!                                  <ms>: no motion, no damage, no queued upload, no pending page
//!                                  capture (`nj_machine::idle`'s own change signal, which ignores the
//!                                  keepalive and the bound video plane). The screenshot pipeline's
//!                                  trigger: it waits on the app's state, never on a wall clock.
//!   NJ_SHOT_AFTER=<ms>      …and not before <ms> since the first frame (default 0), so a
//!                                  scene whose trigger fires late cannot be captured before it
//!   NJ_SHOT_EXIT=1          end the run after an automatic capture — the headless one-shot
//!                                  mode (an orderly stop through the app's own shutdown, never an
//!                                  `exit()` from inside the frame: see [`maybe_capture`])
//!   NJ_SHOT_ALPHA=1         write RGBA (premultiplied, as the framebuffer holds it)
//!
//! The `shot` token on the remote FIFO captures on demand instead, which is what an interactive
//! agent session uses: drive the UI, then ask for the frame. Those are NUMBERED (`shot-1.png`,
//! `shot-2.png`, …) so a sequence of them does not overwrite one file and race whoever is reading
//! it, and they never exit the process — the caller is still driving.
