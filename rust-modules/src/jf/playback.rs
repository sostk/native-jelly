//! Playback against Jellyfin: the `POST /Items/{id}/PlaybackInfo` negotiation, the URL it yields,
//! and the session reports that follow.
//!
//! **The protocol this implements is Jellyfin's own.** A client states what it can decode as a
//! `DeviceProfile`; the server answers per media source with `SupportsDirectPlay`,
//! `SupportsDirectStream` and `SupportsTranscoding`, plus a `TranscodingUrl` when it would convert
//! and `TranscodeReasons` saying why. The reported `PlayMethod` follows the server and the official
//! web client (`playbackmanager.js` `createStreamInfo`):
//!
//! * `DirectPlay` — `SupportsDirectPlay`: the file's own bytes,
//!   `GET /Videos/{id}/stream.{ext}?static=true`.
//! * `Transcode` — anything played from the `TranscodingUrl`, which the server itself marks
//!   `Transcode` (`MediaInfoHelper`). That includes a remux (both streams copied into a new
//!   container) and an audio-only conversion: the dashboard derives "Remux" / "Direct Stream" from
//!   `TranscodingInfo`, which the server clears on every report whose method is not `Transcode`.
//!   Which lanes are copied is carried separately, on [`Lane::copied`].
//!
//! [`Jf::negotiate`] asks once and answers with a typed [`Negotiation`]: the method the server
//! agreed to, the URL to open, and per lane the SOURCE codec beside the codec that will actually
//! arrive (the Load payload has to describe the latter).
//!
//! `PlaySessionId` is the server's handle for the negotiated playback. Everything after the
//! negotiation is keyed by it: `/Sessions/Playing{,/Progress,/Stopped}` and
//! `DELETE /Videos/ActiveEncodings`, which ends one encoder. The negotiation stores that id (and
//! the source id and track indexes it resolved) in a table keyed by the app's own session string,
//! so the later calls report the same playback the server registered.
//!
//! **One playback, many encoders.** A seek, a track switch, a quality change and every resumed
//! conversion re-negotiate under a new `PlaySessionId`. As in the web client's `changeStream`, the
//! replacement names the playing media source, inherits the playback's start (so it reports
//! `/Progress`, not a second `/Sessions/Playing` the server would count as another play), and the
//! encoder it replaced is ended with `DELETE /Videos/ActiveEncodings` — never with a `Stopped`
//! report, whose position the server writes into the user's resume point.
