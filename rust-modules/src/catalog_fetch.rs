//! Plex library fetch/parse into the private catalog (was src/pms.c), read by the UI
//! via the retained publication (`hubs_snapshot()` → `HubsView`) and movie()/hub_item().
//! The fetch + JSON parse go through the typed `crate::catalog` client (serde DTOs) — no
//! hand-built paths or `Value` scraping here.
//!
//! **This is the data module `stores::hubs` (`docs/stores-as-machines.md`) is a machine over** —
//! each production `Bridge` owns a `stores::hubs::HubsStore`, whose `run`/`run_with_directory`

//! `edit_item` here against its own `PmsState`/`Arc<PmsAdapter>`, the same relationship the owned
//! `BrowseStore::run` has to Browse commands against its explicit state. **Those forwarding targets
//! cannot be scoped narrower than `pub(crate)`, and that is a fact about Rust module topology,
//! not an oversight**: `pms` and `stores` are both top-level children of the crate root, so
//! neither is an ancestor of the other, and `pub(in path)` requires `path` to name an ancestor of
//! the ITEM's own module. There is no visibility keyword that means "visible to `stores::hubs`
//! and nobody else" for an item defined here. What IS enforceable, and is: (1) anything with no
//! caller outside this file at all — `hub_state` — is plain private, not `pub(crate)`; (2) every
//! mutator `stores::hubs` (or a test) can reach — `request_refetch_hubs`, `request_retry`,
//! `edit_item`, `tick`, `apply_landing`, `reset`, and the `_for_test` seeds — asserts
//! `nj_base::testlock::held()` under `#[cfg(test)]` before it touches the crate-wide test-only
//! state those seeds still share (see `lib.rs::testlock` and D5), which is the runtime half of
//! the same contract a compile-time visibility keyword cannot express across two sibling
//! modules. `ci/allow/mutators.txt`'s `# count: 0` already
//! proves no PRODUCTION line outside `pms`/`stores::hubs` spells the old direct-call form; this
//! is the part that keyword-level `pub(super)` genuinely cannot add on top of that count.
