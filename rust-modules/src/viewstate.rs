//! viewstate — the server-side **view-state writes**, off the SDL thread.
//!
//! Three actions share one shape: Mark as Watched (`/:/scrobble`), Mark as Unwatched
//! (`/:/unscrobble`) and Remove from Continue Watching (`PUT /actions/removeFromContinueWatching`).
//! Each is one request to the item's own server, followed by a refresh of every surface that
//! describes that item — Home's shelves always, plus the detail page when the press came from it.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! All of it used to run INLINE on the frame loop, straight off the key handler: the scrobble, then
//! `detail::refresh_view_state` (a blocking 2-5 round-trip re-read), then
//! a blocking `/hubs` + `/hubs/continueWatching` pair for the owned server. The justifying comment
//! priced it at "~100 ms LAN and deliberately so", which was true of
//! the one-LAN-server world it was written in. With a share registered, the item's server is
//! routinely a WAN address or a machine that is simply asleep, and every one of those calls is
//! bounded by `stream::CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` (2 s) plus a 15 s `SO_RCVTIMEO` — so ONE Mark as Watched
//! press could park the whole UI for seconds and, on a stalled read, for half a minute. `pms.rs`
//! names that exact hazard for hub FETCHES and fixed it there with a worker; this is the same
//! discipline applied to the WRITES.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! * **The press is optimistic.** [`request`] flips what the shelves and the loaded detail item say
//!   about the item BEFORE anything leaves the machine ([`crate::catalog_fetch::edit_item`],
//!   [`crate::metadata::set_watched_local`]), so the tick, the veil and the resume bar all change on
//!   the frame of the press however far away the server is. The refresh that follows the write is
//!   the reconcile: it is the server's own answer, and it silently corrects an optimistic edit that
//!   turned out to be wrong. A server that never answers leaves the edit standing — the same "a
//!   failure never blanks a populated Home" rule `pms.rs` keeps for a fetch, applied to a write.
//! * **One write at a time, in order.** These are not idempotent reads: a watched/unwatched pair
//!   landing out of order leaves the server saying the opposite of what the user last asked for. So
//!   the queue is drained strictly one worker at a time, and a second press on the SAME item
//!   replaces the queued one rather than joining it ([`coalesce`]) — the newest intent for an item
//!   is the only one worth a round trip.
//! * **One refresh per burst.** The hub refetch (and the detail re-read) is deferred until the queue
//!   empties, so ticking four episodes watched in a row costs four writes and one refresh.
//! * **A refused spawn is a retry, never a panic and never a fallback to blocking.**
//!   `task::spawn_small` returning false means the OS is out of threads; the queue keeps its head
//!   and [`pump`] tries again after [`RETRY_FRAMES`], the same degradation `search.rs` and
//!   `browse.rs` apply to a refused fetch.
//!
//! ## Watch state follows the TITLE, not the server
//!
//! View state in Plex is per-server: two copies of one film on two servers are two independent
//! items with independent `viewCount`, and the rest of this app is built on exactly that
//! (`docs/shared-servers.md` §1). Marking something watched is nonetheless a statement about the
//! TITLE — "I have seen this" is not a fact about a file on a particular host — so a
//! [`Write::Watched`]/[`Write::Unwatched`] **fans out**: the worker resolves the item's portable
//! `guid` across every registered source and repeats the write on each copy it finds.
//!
//! Five things about that, each a decision rather than an implementation detail:
//!
//! * **The identity is the `guid`, never the `ratingKey`.** Every item-shaped integer Plex issues
//!   is server-local and dense from 1, so both servers in this household have a `ratingKey` 4
//!   (`docs/shared-servers.md` §1) — a fan-out matched on the key would confidently mark a
//!   DIFFERENT film watched on the other machine, which is a bug this repo has already had once
//!   (`ui::detail`'s note on posting a borrowed item's key to our own server).
//!   [`crate::catalog::Client::find_by_guid`] is the lookup, the same one "Also available" resolves
//!   its rows with.
//! * **No resume position is ever COPIED from one server to another — only the watched flag
//!   travels.** This is the subtle half. A resume offset is about a file you are streaming from one
//!   host, and `screens::alt_sources`' module doc reasons that out at length; that reasoning stands. So
//!   `unscrobble` IS repeated on the other copies (it is the "unwatched" end of one control, and
//!   clearing the flag is the same statement about the title), but no `viewOffset` is read here and
//!   none is pushed anywhere.
//!   **One consequence has to be said plainly, because "the position does not travel" does not
//!   sound like it:** [`Write::Unwatched`] is `/:/unscrobble`, which clears `viewCount` **and**
//!   `viewOffset` — so marking a title unwatched DISCARDS the other copies' resume points too, the
//!   same thing the press does to the copy in hand. That is what "I have not seen this" means, and
//!   it is the reason [`Write::Watched`] and [`Write::Unwatched`] are not symmetric in cost: a
//!   scrobble adds a fact, an unscrobble throws two away, on every source that holds the title.
//! * **[`Write::RemoveFromDeck`] does NOT fan out** ([`Write::propagates`]). The deck is a
//!   per-server surface, and taking a friend's item off *your* Continue Watching is not what that
//!   row promises.
//! * **Resolved at WRITE time, on the worker.** Not from a detail page's earlier cross-source
//!   resolve: the press can come from a Home / Library / Search card menu where none ever ran, and
//!   a behaviour that only worked after visiting a page is a behaviour that is wrong most of the
//!   time. A press that carries no guid gets one looked up from its own `(server, ratingKey)`.
//! * **Best-effort per source, and unconditional.** A source that is asleep or refuses costs its
//!   own log line and nothing else — the write the user pressed has already reported, and one
//!   unreachable share must never fail or retry it. There is no setting: this app has no
//!   preferences screen by design.
//!
//! The cost is real and priced deliberately: a press on a two-source install is one write, one guid
//! query per source, and one write per other copy — every one of them on the worker and none on the
//! frame loop. The queue still drains ONE worker at a time, so a burst of four episodes pays it four
//! times in sequence rather than in parallel; that serialisation is the point rather than an
//! oversight (see [`kick`]), and the single deferred refresh at the end of a burst is unchanged.
//!
//! **What the other copies look like on the press frame: unchanged, and that is deliberate.**
//! [`request`]'s optimistic edit can only reach the `(sid, rk)` the user pressed, because no other
//! key is KNOWN yet — the resolve is what discovers them, and it is off-thread by construction.
//! The copies are flipped locally when the fan-out reports ([`ViewStateState::pump`] applies
//! [`edit_local_with_owners`] to each
//! one the server took), and the hub refetch that already follows every write reconciles whatever
//! that missed. So the copy in hand changes at once and the others change a round trip later,
//! which is the same contract the press already has with its own server.
//!
//! Physical ownership now follows Browse's pattern: `stores::viewstate::ViewStateStore` owns this
//! module's main-thread `ViewStateState`, an `Arc<ViewStateAdapter>` mailbox captured by every
//! worker, and its notice. Reset rotates the adapter, and request IDs fence malformed or stale
//! completions even within one adapter. There is no process-global ViewState transport or state.
