// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `docs/perf-damage-tracking-verdict.md` §5 is the design. The whole app has run with
// `set_opaque_region(NULL)` since boot — on Home, Library, Detail, Person, Login and Profiles,
// where there is no video plane underneath and nothing to show through. The protocol calls the
// opaque region "an optimization hint for the compositor that lets it optimize the redrawing of
// content behind opaque regions", and a sibling measured LG's `surface-manager` at 34.4% of every
// frame's GPU cycles, doing exactly one full-screen textured blit of our surface. Whether that
// charge is per-COMMIT bookkeeping or per-BLENDED-PIXEL is the question, and nobody has varied the
// variable: all four prior compositor measurements held the surface non-opaque at 1920x1080.
//
// **Default behaviour is byte-identical.** Without the trigger `region_init` never runs, `ENABLED`
// stays false, and `opaque_route` returns on its first load.
//
// **Plane-scoped, and it must be.** Marking the surface opaque while the hardware video plane is
// bound beneath it would occlude a plane that has not torn down yet — which is why this reasserts
// NULL every frame while the plane is bound. `opaque_route(video_plane_bound)` therefore asserts
// NULL while the plane is bound and the full region otherwise (a pre-bind spinner or a post-unbind
// read-out gets the opaque region back), and remembers which it last sent so an unchanged state
// costs one atomic load and no protocol traffic (the region is double-buffered but otherwise
// STICKY: "the pending and current regions are never changed" otherwise).
//
// **No new link dependency, deliberately.** A `wl_region` needs `wl_compositor.create_region`, and
// the only wayland objects this app has are the display and surface SDL handed it — so the
// compositor has to come from a registry bind. `wl_proxy_marshal_constructor_versioned` is absent
// from `libwayland-client` on webOS below 4.4.2 and the `*_interface` data symbols would be three
// more `DT_NEEDED` requirements, so every one of them is resolved through `RTLD_DEFAULT` against
// the libwayland-client already linked and loaded. `tools/fwcompat.py` is unchanged by this file.

// ---- The COMPOSITOR FRAME-CALLBACK PROBE (`/tmp/nativejelly-framecb`) -----------------------------
//
// A present's wait for a free back buffer is paid inside the frame's first framebuffer-0 command
// (the `clear` span), and from inside the app that wait reads the same whether the compositor
// repainted late, skipped a repaint, or repainted on time and we were slow to notice. This probe
// asks the compositor directly: one `wl_surface.frame` request per presented frame, placed before
// the swap that commits it, whose `done(time)` event carries the COMPOSITOR'S OWN millisecond
// stamp of the repaint that picked the commit up. Printed beside the frame's `FRAMEDROP` line
// with our own monotonic clock, the two tell those cases apart.
//
// It also prices the frame thread over the three stretches of a player frame's present: `w` (the
// first framebuffer command, where the driver waits for a back buffer), `d` (the draw after it)
// and `s` (the swap). Each prints `<p>=<wall>/<cpu>/<runq>` in ms and `<p>sw=<slept>/<preempted>`
// context switches: wall time that is neither CPU nor run-queue wait was spent BLOCKED, run-queue
// wait is a thread that wanted to run and was not given a CPU, and CPU is work. `wait_at=` is the
// monotonic ms at which the wait began, for lining a frame up with a kernel trace.
//
// Same linkage rule as the opaque experiment above: every libwayland entry point is resolved
// from the process's own scope, ONCE (`frame_syms`, on the first armed present, before the swap
// stretch is marked), so the probe adds no symbol to the link and its lookups are not charged to
// the `s` stretch. Unarmed it is one latched bool per presented frame. The whole probe is
// compiled only with `devtriggers` (and not in the simulator); the shipping build has the empty
// stubs at the end of this section.
