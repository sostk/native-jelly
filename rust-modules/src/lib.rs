//! plxnative-modules — the Rust app core, built as a staticlib and linked into the C
//! boot shim. The crate's C surface is tiny: C calls `plex_run` (port.rs), writes the fallback
//! image marker through `plx_crash_write_image_marker`, re-enters the native-crash spool through
//! `plx_sentry_spool_external`, and forwards the two Starfish callbacks (`sf_on_event`/
//! `acb_on_event`, player/mod.rs). Everything else is Rust-internal (the per-module `repr(C)`
//! shapes are migration legacy, not ABI).
mod abr; // client-managed fixed-session HLS controller: estimate, propose, prime, then commit
mod app; // run_application — the Rust app core / event loop (the entry inverted from main.c; port.rs's `plex_run` hands over to it)
mod appkit; // widgets shared by several screens, composed from `ui` over application types (the player HUD, the track menus, the Sources row model)
mod aq;
mod auth; // plex.tv login/boot flow controller (PIN/QR → discovery → who's-watching → install)
mod browse; // Library browse: per-section paged catalog (sparse store + off-thread page fetches)
mod capture; // dev live UI capture stream: own-GLES-frame grab → MPEG1/TS or JPEG → TCP (UI plane only)
mod coldstart; // retires old last-page bookmarks; authenticated cold boots now stay on Home
mod curlio; // the HTTPS media plane: a remote file pulled by byte range over libcurl-multi (stream.rs is the plaintext-socket twin)
mod dev; // the /tmp/plxnative-* trigger surface, behind one `devtriggers` feature — read it before adding a trigger
#[macro_use]
mod diag; // typed usage schema plus log/lab scrub, ring and zlib; native crashes have a separate allowlist
mod ff; // THE demuxer — the FFmpeg 9.0 this app BUNDLES and pins (majors 63/63/61), dlopen'd by absolute path beside the binary, never the television's
mod focusprobe; // dev: one diffable line naming everything app.rs's key ladder can move, logged when it changes
mod hls; // strict parser/auth/timeline for the measured one-variant PMS HLS shape
mod http; // the ONE door out of the control plane: dispatch a Plex REST request on its origin's scheme (stream.rs for http, net.rs/libcurl for https)
mod jf; // Jellyfin behind the plex::Client facade: seat registry, DTOs, DTO→PMS conversion, ops
mod lab; // Cloud Lab bridge: pinned diagnostic uploads + optional outbound command long-poll
mod metadata; // item detail data layer (detail page): full metadata + seasons/episodes + cast + related
mod person; // person/actor page data layer: the header handed in by the cast row + /library/people/{id}/media
mod collection; // collection page model: tag resolution, header metadata and paged members
mod player; // buffer-feed video engine (was playback.c) — step 5
mod plex; // typed Plex API layer (rust-modules/src/plex/) — one method per PMS operation (the live READ layer; playback ops still in route.rs)
mod pms;
// Pure RELEASE_LINE-parsing helpers, `include!`d verbatim by build.rs so `cargo test --lib`
// actually runs their unit tests (see the module for why). Nothing in the app itself calls
// them at runtime — the version rule they implement is applied once, at compile time, by
// build.rs — so they exist in THIS crate only for the test build; `#[cfg(test)]` here, not on
// the functions themselves, because build.rs's own separate compilation is never built with
// `--test` and needs them unconditionally.
#[cfg(test)]
