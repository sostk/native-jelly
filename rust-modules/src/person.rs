//! person — the actor/person page's data layer (the store `ui/person.rs` draws).
//!
//! Sibling of `metadata.rs` (the detail page's item store) and `browse.rs` (the Library's paged
//! catalog), and built on the same three pieces: [`nj_base::task::spawn_small`] + a `Mutex` mailbox
//! + a generation, applied on the MAIN thread by [`PersonState::pump`] once a frame. One
//! `PersonState` and rotated `Arc<PersonAdapter>` belong to each production Bridge; screens borrow
//! a `PersonView` through their frame `Cx`, so neither reads nor workers select process state.
//!
//! ## A filmography is a fact about a PERSON, not about a server
//!
//! **Every registered server is asked, and the shelves are the merge.** This page used to fetch
//! from exactly one — the machine whose credit row opened it — and present the result as the
//! person's filmography. With a share registered that is a lie in both directions: a person opened
//! from your own library hid everything of theirs on a friend's server, and (once a search screen
//! can surface the same actor from a borrowed source) *which server you happened to arrive
//! through* decided what their page showed. It is the same page either way now.
//!
//! **The join key is the `tagKey`, and only the `tagKey`** ([`resolve_local`]). [`Person::guid`] is
//! plex.tv's global person id; the numeric `personId` in [`Person::key`] is server-local exactly
//! like a `ratingKey` (docs/shared-servers.md §1) and addresses a *different person* on the next
//! machine. So every server but the origin costs one extra round trip — a `/hubs/search` for the
//! name, whose `actor` hub is joined back on the guid — before its filmography can be asked for at
//! all.
//!
//! ## The fetches, and their index space
//!
//! Three requests **per source**, plus TWO that are not per-source at all:
//!
//! * **[`K_RESOLVE`]** — `GET /hubs/search?query=<name>` on that server, joined on the `tagKey` to
//!   its own local `personId`. Skipped entirely for the ORIGIN server, which handed us that id in
//!   the credit row. A server that has never heard of them answers here, and that is an ANSWER: it
//!   contributes nothing, fails nobody, and shows no error.
//! * **[`K_MEDIA`]** — the shelves: `GET /library/people/{personId}/media` returns everything the
//!   person appears in across EVERY library section at once, no per-section `?actor=<id>` sweep.
//!   The rows are split into the Movies / Shows shelves by **each row's own `type`**; the
//!   container's `viewGroup` is a trap (it read `"movie"` on a response whose only row was a
//!   `show`). Each row is stamped with the source's `ServerId`, which is what makes a card open on
//!   the machine it came from.
//! * **[`K_ROLES`]** — the character names, one batched `GET /library/metadata/{that source's shelf
//!   keys}` ([`crate::catalog::Client::metadata_many`]). It exists because the shelf listing does NOT
//!   carry them: its rows have a `Role[]` whose entries hold only `tag`. It is the ONE fetch here
//!   that DEPENDS on another — it can only be addressed once that source's shelves have landed, and
//!   [`address`] expresses that by keying it on that source's shelf keys, which are empty until
//!   then. Per source, because a `ratingKey` csv means nothing on another machine, and filtered on
//!   the SOURCE's own local id, not the origin's.
//! * **[`F_PROFILE`]** — the biography, from plex.tv: `GET
//!   discover.provider.plex.tv/library/people/{tagKey}` over the TLS+DNS `net.rs` path (see
//!   `plex/discover.rs` for the wire facts). **Deliberately still single.** It is already GLOBAL —
//!   plex.tv answers about the person, not about anybody's library — so fanning it out would be the
//!   same request N times for one answer.
//! * **[`F_CREDITS`]** — the filmography, from the same host: `GET
//!   …/library/people/{tagKey}/credits` → `CreditGroup[]`. Global for exactly [`F_PROFILE`]'s
//!   reason and then some, since a person's CAREER is not a fact any server has an opinion about.
//!   What the servers contribute to it is the availability JOIN, and that rides on the [`K_MEDIA`]
//!   answers this page already makes — so it adds one request per person, not one per source. The
//!   screen is [`crate::ui::filmography`]; the display model it draws is [`filmography`].
//!
//! Every fetch's plumbing is indexed by ONE flat key ([`fx`]/[`un_fx`]): its mailbox and its
//! single-flight claim as one [`Fetch`] ([`FETCH`]), its retry countdown beside them ([`RETRY_CD`],
//! whose doc says why that one cannot join the struct). The key is the registry **slot** rather
//! than a position in [`Person::srcs`]: a slot is stable for the life of the process, so a landing
//! can never be applied to a different server because the source list moved under it.
//!
//! **The header still MOUNTS on what it was handed.** `Role[]` already carries the name and the
//! headshot (`plex::Tag`), so the page draws instantly and the plex.tv fields fade in under the
//! name when they land. That ordering is the whole degrade strategy: the biography request can
//! fail, or the person can be one plex.tv has never heard of, and the page must then read as
//! *finished* at portrait + name — never as a row of fields that failed to load. Nothing in the
//! header is a placeholder; each line is drawn only when it has content.
//!
//! **The three id spaces are not interchangeable.** [`Person::key`] is the ORIGIN server's local
//! `personId` (the numeric `Tag::id`, or its `tagKey` when that server omitted the number) and
//! addresses `/media` **on `Person::sid` only**; [`Src::local`] is the same thing for every other
//! source, resolved rather than given; [`Person::guid`] is the `tagKey` and is the ONLY thing
//! plex.tv answers to — the numeric id 404s there (`"Invalid value provided for metadataId!"`).
//! Keep all three; do not collapse them.

Cynthia Erivo is a British actress, singer and songwriter whose work spans the stage, the concert \
hall and the screen. She trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 2010 after an \
earlier spell reading music psychology, and spent her first professional years in ensemble and \
understudy work in London before the role that would define the next decade found her.\n\n\
That role was Celie in the Menier Chocolate Factory's 2013 revival of The Color Purple, a stripped \
back staging that traded spectacle for the voice at its centre. When the production transferred to \
Broadway in 2015 it won two Tony Awards, one of them hers; the cast recording took a Grammy, and a \
Daytime Emmy followed for a televised performance. Three of the four American entertainment awards \
in under three years left her one short of a set that fewer than twenty people have completed.\n\n\
Her screen career began in earnest with a run of ensemble thrillers before Harriet in 2019, in \
which she played Harriet Tubman and earned nominations for both Best Actress and Best Original \
Song in the same year. She has since moved between prestige television, animation and the kind of \
large studio musical that asks a performer to sing live on camera, a discipline she has spoken \
about as closer to theatre than to film.\n\n\
Alongside acting she writes and records her own music, and has been open about the relationship \
between the two: songs, she has said, are where the parts she plays go when the run ends. She \
continues to divide her time between London and New York.";
