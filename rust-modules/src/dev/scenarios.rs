//! Every dev-trigger ARM — the code that reads `/tmp/plxnative-*` through [`plx_base::devtrig::flag`] /
//! [`plx_base::devtrig::read`] / [`plx_base::devtrig::latched_flag!`] and reacts to it — gathered on one file (UI
//! restructure spec v4 §3.3 step 2 / §11, phase 10 lane P). A PURE MOVE: no trigger was renamed,
//! no timing changed, no ordering changed. Before this phase the arms were spread across four
//! loop files — `app/boot.rs` (read-once boot flags), `app/run.rs`'s `dev_scripts` and the
//! oscillator continuations embedded in its frame phases, `app/content.rs` (the detail-page
//! headless walk), and one pre-SDL flag in `app/mod.rs` — each reaching straight into `App`'s
//! fields. They still reach `App`'s fields, through `&mut` — [`Scenarios`] is what changed: it is
//! the ONE struct, owned by `App` as `app.scenarios`, that gathers every arm's own retry counter,
//! oscillator phase and boot-time latch, so a field used by no production code has exactly one
//! home instead of living beside `route`/`trail`/`pages` on `App` itself. A field genuine
//! production code also reads (`t0`, `refresh_hubs_at`) stayed on `App`, as the phase's own
//! instructions require.
//!
//! **Entry points, called from the loop at the exact positions the arms used to sit at:**
//! [`pre_boot`] (today's `app/mod.rs:451`, before SDL exists), the individual `at_boot`-style
//! functions below (each named for its trigger, called inline from `app::boot::boot` in the same
//! order the arms always ran in — several of them are read directly at the boot-decision call
//! site rather than through one grand entry point, because the boot gate's own control flow
//! — which `BootTo` a login/token/session resolves to — is not itself a dev arm and must not move
//! with it), [`advance_content_boot`] (today's `app/content.rs`'s `ContentBoot` machinery),
//! [`each_frame`] (today's `dev_scripts`, plus the oscillator continuations that used to be
//! embedded inline in `app/run.rs`'s `update`/`land_results`/`heartbeat` phases, called from this
//! file's `*_tick` functions at those same phase boundaries).
//!
//! **Not scenarios, deliberately left where they were:** the recorder/replay path
//! (`plxnative-rec`/`plxnative-recplay`, `app::clock`) is a DIFFERENT kind of thing — it observes
//! or reproduces a whole session and must never decide which screen a boot starts on (`dev.rs`'s
//! `DIAG` doc says why) — so its own machinery (`app::recorder::Recplay`) stays in
//! `app/recorder.rs`; only the two raw trigger reads run through the thin passthroughs
//! [`rec_trigger`] / [`recplay_trigger`] below, for the same reason every other read in this crate
//! goes through one door. The DIAG list itself stays in `dev.rs`.
