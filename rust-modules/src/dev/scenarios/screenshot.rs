//! The screenshot pipeline's arms — `make screenshots` (`tools/screenshots.py`), whose scene
//! manifest (`tests/screenshots/scenes.json`) names each documentation figure as a target STATE
//! and reaches it through these triggers and the older ones (`heropin`, `grid`, `itemmenu`,
//! `acct`, `detail`, `search`, `library`, `play`…), never through a key walk.
//!
//! Each arm here drives the SAME command path a user's key does (`LibraryCmd::FocusGrid` reseats
//! focus the way the grid's own navigation does; `LibraryCmd::OpenMenu` is OK on the toolbar
//! chip), and each logs one line when its state is REACHED rather than when it was asked for, so
//! the driver can verify from the event log that the picture it captured is the one the manifest
//! named. `libtype` chooses the listing (the TYPE menu's value) the others then act on. Every arm
//! gives up after [`CEILING_MS`] with a log line of its own, so a scene whose data never arrives
//! fails loudly instead of capturing the wrong screen.
//!
//! Dev-only, like every arm in [`super`]: the reads go through `devtrig::read`, which is `None` at
//! compile time without the `devtriggers` feature.
