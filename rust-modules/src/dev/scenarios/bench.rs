//! The stress-bench oscillators' own state — counted, deterministic twins of `navosc`/`modalosc`
//! (`/tmp/nativejelly-pushbench[=<n>[,<ratingKey>]]`, `/tmp/nativejelly-modalbench[=<n>]`). Where
//! those two bounce forever so a device FPS scene can sample a settled ramp, a bench runs a FIXED
//! `n` (default 100) push→settle→pop or present→settle→dismiss cycles through the real bridge
//! entry points, rotating a target list, logging one `bench:` event-log line per cycle
//! (`super::bench_frame_tick`'s doc has the wire format), and then stopping — the harness grades
//! the whole run, not a sampled window of an unbounded one.
//!
//! A third bench, [`DeepBench`] (`/tmp/nativejelly-deepbench[=<depth>[,<ratingKey>]]`), does not
//! round-trip: it pushes `depth` pages with no pop in between, then pops all the way back to the
//! root one page at a time, so the harness can grade whether a page transition's cost or a
//! session's memory holds flat as the real nav stack goes ninety-plus entries deep rather than
//! the shallow depth-1↔2 churn `PushBench` measures. Each PUSH or POP is its own `Start`/`Settle`
//! pair — one nav op per pair, not a round trip — so it reuses [`BenchClock`]/[`bench_advance`]
//! unchanged with `n = 2 * depth`.
//!
//! **This module is the pure half.** [`BenchClock`]/[`bench_advance`]/[`bench_target_index`]/
//! [`deep_step`] know nothing about `App`, a bridge call, or a target's name — they are driven by
//! a `now: u32` the caller supplies, which is what lets the unit tests below drive a whole run
//! with a fake clock in a few milliseconds instead of a live loop. The impure half — which bridge
//! call each target opens/closes, the frame-time accumulation, the `bench:`/`done` log lines — is
//! `dev::scenarios::push_bench_tick`/`modal_bench_tick`/`deep_bench_tick`/`bench_frame_tick`,
//! which hold the `&mut App` this module deliberately never sees.
