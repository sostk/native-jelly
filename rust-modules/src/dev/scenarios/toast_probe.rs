//! `/tmp/nativejelly-toast=<text>` — ask the television's notification service, in-process and jailed
//! as the app, whether it will show `<text>` as a system toast. A measurement, not the feature: the
//! product toast is `app::clock_notice`, and this trigger asks the same service with arbitrary
//! text, plain and as the app, logging each outcome.
//!
//! **Two attempts, each on its own log line, so a refusal is never silent:**
//!
//! 1. `toast-probe plain: …` — the plain anonymous call, `sourceId` set to this app's id.
//! 2. `toast-probe as-app: …` — the same payload through `LSCallFromApplicationOneReply`.
//!
//! Each line carries the service's whole reply (`reply=<json>`, a refusal's `errorText` included) or
//! the bus failure's `stage`/`code`/`detail`. The attempts run on a worker, [`LEAD_IN`] after boot
//! and [`GAP`] apart, so a screenshot can be timed against the log (a toast lives only a few
//! seconds). Read once at boot; absent from shipping builds with the rest of the trigger surface.
