//! `/tmp/nativejelly-clockfact=nokey|keychanged|engaged:<year>` — plant a wrong-clock fact at boot,
//! so the read-outs and the toast that read `net::keypin`'s facts can be looked at in the simulator
//! with no television, no certificate and no clock to change (issue #378).
//!
//! * `nokey` — [`keypin::Blocked::NoKey`]: a failed Home or Library names a wrong clock.
//! * `keychanged` — [`keypin::Blocked::KeyChanged`]: the same, for a server whose key changed.
//! * `engaged:<year>` — key mode engaged with the device believing `<year>`; `engaged` alone
//!   plants "year unknown". It raises `app::clock_notice`'s toast, which needs the TV's
//!   notification service and so only logs its attempt off-device.
//!
//! The fact is SYNTHETIC and says so in the log (`keypin::plant`): it is filed under a host no
//! session binds, so no projection clears it. Read once at boot; absent from shipping builds.
