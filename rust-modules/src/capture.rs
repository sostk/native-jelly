//! Dev/testing live UI capture stream: the app's own GLES frames, GPU-downscaled and
//! encoded to ONE client per wire mode (`tools/stream-screen.py --source app`).
//! Two hello-selected modes: **MPEG1-in-MPEG-TS** (raw TS, encoder in ff.rs's venc
//! section) and **JPEG** (`PXFR`-framed, NEON libjpeg-turbo). Both run ~30fps at
//! 960x540 — the MIN_GAP_MS cadence cap, with the UI still at 60fps — vs the ~3fps
//! external capture service. UI PLANE ONLY either way (the hardware video overlay is
//! invisible to glReadPixels; watching real playback still needs the service path).
//! GL work lives in `gfx::cap_cycle`; this module owns the trigger, the threads, the
//! single-slot mailbox, and the wire protocol.
//!
//! Enabled by the `nativejelly-capture` trigger (content: optional port, else [`default_port`] —
//! 8910 for the app users install, one higher for a developer build beside it), read
//! once at boot like every dev trigger — and excluded from `automated_boot`'s DIAG
//! list (dev.rs) so attaching a live view to an interactive session doesn't suppress
//! the who's-watching picker. With no client connected, `tick()` is one relaxed
//! atomic load; GL resources are allocated lazily on the first captured frame.
//!
//! Threading (the posters.rs pattern: statics + Condvar + join on shutdown):
//! - main/GL thread: `tick()` — capture into the mailbox (newest-wins, never blocks;
//!   a still-occupied slot or a <33ms gap just skips the frame, which self-paces
//!   capture to encoder throughput).
//! - `caplisten`: accept loop. Hello: `PXRQ w:u16 h:u16` (8B LE, legacy jpeg; 0,0 =
//!   default 480x270, quantized to 480x270/960x540 by width) or `PXR2 w h kind:u8
//!   rate:u8 pad:u16` (12B; kind 1 = MPEG1-in-TS at rate*100kbps, raw unframed TS on
//!   the socket — self-syncing 188B packets, encoder in ff.rs's venc section). TWO
//!   slots keyed by kind, LAST-WINS per slot: a new client displaces the old (after
//!   standby the old socket is a half-open zombie that would otherwise lock the real
//!   client out). The listener only `shutdown()`s the displaced fd — capenc is the
//!   SOLE closer of client fds, so a send in flight can never race a close and write
//!   into a recycled fd (a live PMS socket!). An mpeg client forces the 960x540 chain.
//! - `capenc`: waits on the mailbox, encodes JPEG q70 for the jpeg slot, sends one
//!   `PXFR` frame; MPEG1-encodes + TS-muxes the same frame for the mpeg slot.
//!   Encode is the NDK's NEON libjpeg-turbo (`libturbojpeg.so.0`, deployed next to
//!   the binary by `make deploy` and dlopen'd here) — tjCompress2 eats the RGBA
//!   buffer directly and TJFLAG_BOTTOMUP swallows the bottom-up parity, so there is
//!   no CPU strip/flip pass at all. If the .so is missing the slow pure-Rust
//!   encoder (RGBA->RGB strip + `image` crate) takes over — the stream still works,
//!   just at the old ~6fps@960. On a 5s idle timeout it resends the last frame
//!   (seq unchanged) as a keepalive so the host's deadness timer doesn't trip while
//!   the player route (no UI swaps) is up. MSG_NOSIGNAL on every send — SIGPIPE
//!   would kill the app. A stats line (fps, encode/read/cycle ms, KB/frame) logs
//!   every ~5s while frames flow.
//!
//! Wire formats, TV -> client (no client->server traffic after the hello):
//! - jpeg slot, LE: `"PXFR" | payload_len:u32 | seq:u32 | ticks_ms:u32 | <JPEG>`; a
//!   client resyncs by scanning for the magic.
//! - mpeg slot: raw MPEG-TS, no framing at all (188-byte packets are self-syncing on
//!   0x47, which is what jsmpeg's demuxer expects).
