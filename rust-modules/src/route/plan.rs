/// PURE: the local direct-play VIDEO test — the codec, the source's stated frame size and its
/// Dolby Vision layering must ALL clear what this device and this pipeline can actually show.
///
/// The codec half: h264 unconditionally (every webOS SoC decodes it), hevc only when the table
/// lists the decoder — anything else the pipeline cannot feed at all. The resolution half is the
/// local agreement with the profile's `*`-scoped `video.width`/`video.height` limitation: the
/// profile makes PMS transcode a 4K source down for a 1080p-bounded SoC, but when `/decision` is
/// unreachable the fallback never asks PMS, so without this test a 4K file with one
/// direct-playable audio track was fed verbatim to a decoder whose table says 1920x1088 — the
/// wrong-side failure devcaps' own doc names (issue #22's over-claim class), invisible on the
/// dev TV, whose bound is 4096x2176.
///
/// **The Dolby Vision half is the same shape of bug, found the same way, and it is NOT about the
/// decoder.** Every profile's base layer is ordinary HEVC and every one of them decodes here — so
/// a codec-name gate cannot see the difference, which is exactly why this one is needed. What
/// differs is whether the base layer MEANS anything on its own: Profile 8.1's does (it is HDR10,
/// and dropping the RPU costs only the dynamic metadata), Profile 5's does not (single-layer
/// IPT-PQ, no fallback — it decodes cleanly and displays in visibly wrong colours), and Profile
/// 7's is only half the picture.
///
/// **That half arrives here already DECIDED**, as a [`DvPresentation`] rather than as the raw
/// record, and that is the point: the same value the caller passes here is the value the Load
/// payload reads for its `DolbyHdrInfo` node. A stream we DECLARE is one the pipeline puts in
/// Dolby Vision mode, so Profile 5 direct-plays correctly and this gate must let it through; a
/// stream we do not declare falls back to `Dovi::base_layer_unusable`, the pre-declaration rule,
/// which carries the never-convict-on-silence reasoning. Taking the decision as an argument is
/// what makes "the gate and the payload can never disagree" checkable in one place —
/// [`Dovi::presentation`] — instead of being a coincidence between two functions.
///
/// **Refusing here is only half the work, and the other half is not in this function.** A refusal
/// sends the item down the transcode branch — but that branch's query grants PMS `directStream=1`,
/// permission to COPY the video rather than encode it, and the server takes it whenever the source
/// fits the caps: resolution, bitrate, and the profile's own limitation axes. None of those can say
/// "Dolby Vision", so a refused Profile 5 came back `Part.decision=transcode` with the video's own
/// decision `copy` — the same bitstream, the same wrong colours, one container down. `build_stream`
/// therefore also sets [`crate::catalog::TranscodeSpec::no_video_copy`], off `base_layer_unusable` and
/// never off this gate: a COPY carries no declaration, so it stays wrong even for a profile we are
/// happy to direct-play. The measurement is in `docs/pms-api.md` §"What the server actually does
/// with a Dolby Vision source". A server that cannot encode the result is then allowed to say so —
/// this PMS answers general code 2000, *"File is unplayable. DoVi (Profile 5) color space is not
/// supported."*, which [`DvPresentation::Refuse`] turns into the player's read-out. A read-out that
/// names the reason is the honest end of that road; a picture in the wrong colours is not.
///
/// Unknown dimensions (0) PASS: PMS omitting a Media attribute is not evidence of 4K, and
/// failing open is yesterday's behavior for every file the server never measured — the same
/// misread-degrades-to-assumed rule `devcaps::parse` applies, and `Dovi` applies it too.
