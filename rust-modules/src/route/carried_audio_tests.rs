//! Issue #266: `CarriedAudio` — the frozen audio-track snapshot that replaced the four
//! independent `audio_sid`/`audio_ordinal`/`acodec`/`immersive` fields it now carries together.
//! The offering policy has its own file (`plan_audio_enhancement_tests.rs`); these tests pin the
//! surrounding mechanics: what
//! `from_stream` actually reads off a `metadata::Stream`, and that `None` — "server default,
//! facts unknown" — survives every projection/pending/candidate round trip unchanged rather than
//! being turned into a confident `Some` by a struct-literal default somewhere along the way.
