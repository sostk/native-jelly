//! C3: the ONE bounded audio-conversion recovery a play request may make before its first
//! picture, and the only place native audio refusals are learned from.
//!
//! [`AudioRecovery`] is a pure `state + event -> step` value: it reads no global and performs no
//! IO. The pump (`player::pump::recover_refused_audio`, the driver) reads the facts of a failed
//! open into [`OpenFacts`], executes the [`Step`] it gets back (the learner's write through
//! `catalog::session`, the conversion through [`super::convert_refused_audio`]) and reports what
//! happened next as the following events.
//!
//! **The owner is the request.** One value lives in `PlaybackSession::audio_recovery`, and
//! `apply_plan` installs a fresh one with every plan, so a recovery, a counted Load or a pending
//! proof can never cross into the next request. The capability narrowing a conversion needs is
//! the attempt's own (`PlaybackSession::attempt_caps`), never the boot snapshot: a refusal this
//! request learned reaches the next one only as a stored row.
//!
//! **The rung.** It sits after a pending HLS->Original rollback (whose HLS route the failed open
//! owes the viewer) and before the cold Auto Original's HLS contingency and the failure read-out
//! (`player::pump::open_failure_action`). It converts only the audio the pipeline was fed natively,
//! keeps the chosen track, the subtitle and the request's position (a pending seek included), and
//! copies the video whenever the route's contract permits (a Dolby Vision `no_video_copy` stays
//! an encode). It is taken at most once per request, never under Forced Direct Play (the viewer
//! asked not to convert), never after a picture, and only for audio outside the codecs every set
//! decodes ([`suspect`]) — converting AAC to AAC rescues nothing.
//!
//! **What it teaches** (upstream #1034/#1061, refreshed against `b3d2b66c0`):
//! * a refusal that NAMES the audio (`type=18 num=200`) is recorded at once, applied from the next
//!   play start ([`Record::Named`]); once per request, whichever rung follows, Force and a pending
//!   rollback included;
//! * a refusal that names nothing (any other number, or the synchronous `sf_load == 0`) is an
//!   ambiguous one: it teaches only through a PROOF ([`Record::Proof`]) — the conversion landed
//!   with the server stating the audio converted and the video copied, and that route's own Load
//!   (exactly one, no other in between) showed the first picture. Two counted proofs apply
//!   (`catalog::session::LEARNED_REFUSAL_PROOFS`);
//! * a timeout, a video failure, cancellation and a failed conversion teach nothing, and a
//!   transport, HTTP or other demux failure never reaches the rung (the pump consults it only for
//!   a pipeline refusal and a refused Opus header). An Opus header the demuxer refused
//!   ([`OpenFailure::HeaderUnsupported`]) is an unsupported SOURCE: converted, never recorded.
