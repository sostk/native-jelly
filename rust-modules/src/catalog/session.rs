//! Persisted login session — what makes the client **offline-first**. After the one-time online
//! login (account token → server discovery → profile switch), the chosen server's verified
//! [`Origin`] and the profile's token are written here. A stable build can therefore resume a
//! stored HTTPS origin without plex.tv when it remains reachable; an explicit developer-trigger
//! build may also resume a plaintext HTTP origin for lab use. Lives in the writable app dir (device-only; never in the
//! repo). The token fields are secrets — this file's contents are never logged.
//!
//! ## One server, and then the ROSTER
//!
//! [`Session::server`] is still the primary — the one address `can_go_local` runs on and the one
//! `app.rs` boots against — and refresh keeps its origin/tier aligned with the roster. Beside it,
//! [`Session::sources`] records **every**
//! server discovery reached, ours and every share, each with its own address and its own
//! per-(user, server) token, because a shared server is a separate authority that answers 401 to
//! anybody else's credential (`docs/shared-servers.md` §2b). A single-server account writes one
//! entry there and behaves exactly as it always has.
//!
//! **Nothing here carries a timestamp**, deliberately: this TV's wall clock runs ~3 h skewed
//! (`docs/agent-reference.md`), so a stored "last seen" would be a number that cannot be compared with
//! anything and would invite an expiry rule built on it.
//!
//! ## The live read cache
//!
//! [`peek`] (and [`load`] on a hit) answers from an in-memory cache rather than [`IO`] — see
//! [`CACHE`] for the mechanism. The invariants that make it safe to trust:
//!
//! - A cached record is backed by a completed read under [`IO`] or a `Durable` write under `IO`.
//!   The separate `Revoked` arm is a local sign-out, never a claim about durable storage.
//!   Reads, refused updates, and routine preference writes cannot replace it; only an explicit
//!   proven credential write through `install_proven_locked` may restore a session.
//! - Only this module writes the session domain of the persisted record; every
//!   `persistence::commit_*`/`write_session`/`commit_cleared` caller here ends by calling exactly
//!   a read install, proven-write install, cache drop, or local revocation.
//! - `peek` never takes `IO`. A miss schedules one refresh on the bounded persistence FIFO and
//!   returns the last snapshot immediately. The worker reads and installs under `IO`; `CACHE`
//!   is never held across `IO`. Queued and in-flight reads cannot overwrite a later revocation.
//!   Cached views poll `VisibleSessionWatch` on Tick; `peek_settled` distinguishes recovery in
//!   progress from an authoritative empty session, so pending preferences need not flash defaults.
//! - Writers never read from the cache; they read the authority under `IO` (fence correctness),
//!   then install their own outcome over it.
//! - A `Locked`/`Blocked` read or fallback `Ready` during helper unavailability is transient:
//!   served for `LOCKED_RETRY` (about a second) after it finishes, then re-read on the next call
//!   rather than latched forever.
//! - [`clear`] (sign-out) drops the cached `Arc` immediately — it holds the very account/server
//!   tokens sign-out means to get rid of.
//! - Other domains of the same record (consent) are not in this cache and their writes never
//!   touch it. `async_persistence`'s own `CACHE`/`LOCKED_STATE` are a separate, currently-unwired
//!   engine (see its doc) — when it is wired, its coordinator must install into and drop THIS
//!   cache rather than keep a second copy of the session live.
