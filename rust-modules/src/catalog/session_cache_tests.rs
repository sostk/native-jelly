//! [`peek`]'s live [`CACHE`]: the detail page's per-frame preview tick calls it every frame
//! (`player::preview::enabled`), and repeated calls with no intervening write must not re-read the
//! session file — that re-read is a `recv(2)` round trip to the storage helper on the television,
//! measured at ~27 ms/frame and the whole gap between 60 fps and the 26 fps the detail page
//! actually drew (2026-09-18). A write must still be observed on the very next call, a refused or
//! non-durable write must never be mistaken for a fact about the file, and a Locked/Blocked read
//! must be retried rather than latched forever. Replaces `session_write_rev_tests.rs`.
