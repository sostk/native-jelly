//! The `Client` (immutable origin/token + identity) and the four centralisation
//! choke points every op file routes through:
//!   * `with_token` — the ONLY place `X-Plex-Token` is appended.
//!   * `urlenc_str` / `QueryBuilder` — the ONLY place a value is percent-encoded or a query
//!     string is assembled.
//!   * `get_json`/`get_bytes`/`get_void`/`put`/`post` — the ONLY code that issues a PMS request.
//!     They went straight at the raw socket in `nj_net::stream` until this layer learned to speak
//!     to a server that is not on the LAN; they go through [`crate::http`] now, which dispatches

//!     file knows there is more than one transport.
//! Plus `StreamUrl`, the built-playback-target return type for the demux/cue sockets.
//!
//! Fields + helpers are `pub(super)` (visible inside the `plex` module tree only): the op
//! files live in sibling submodules and add `impl Client` blocks, so they need to read the

//! A `Client` is ONE server. WHICH servers exist, which one is current, and how a `&'static
