//! The client-side hub-title override rule (issue #12): PMS localizes `Hub.title` server-side by
//! `X-Plex-Language`, but its per-string translation coverage for a tag like `be` is partial
//! (verified live 2026-09-28, `docs/pms-api.md` §3), so a Home screen mixed Belarusian titles
//! with untranslated ones. The fix is an unconditional client-side override for every
//! **standard** hub — one whose `hubIdentifier` is a stable, documented PMS identifier this
//! catalog knows a message for. A hub this table does not recognize (a custom collection shelf,
//! a promoted rail PMS mints with a different id, anything future) keeps `pms_title` verbatim,
//! exactly as before: there is no substitute catalog for server-owned text this app cannot
//! enumerate.
//!
//! Two call sites share this ONE table so neither can drift from the other's id list:
//! `crate::catalog_fetch::project` (Home's whole-catalog merge, one row per source) and
//! `crate::browse::section_hubs::parse_hubs` (one library's own `/hubs/sections/{id}` shelves).
//! They differ only in **scope** — see [`Scope`] — which is why this is a parameter rather than
//! two copies of the same match.

///   the library folded into the string ("Recently Added in {library}") or a household with two
///   TV libraries reads as one repeated "Recently Added" shelf.
/// - [`Scope::Section`] — `/hubs/sections/{id}`, already scoped to one library. PMS itself titles
///   the same `movie.recentlyadded.<id>` / `tv.recentlyadded.<id>` family plain "Recently Added"
///   here (measured live PMS 1.43.3 — the fixtures in `section_hubs.rs`'s `HUBS_JSON` and
