/// the two fast paths this client is built around become the wrong answer, and both have to go:
///
/// * **No direct play.** Direct play streams the file's own bytes, and a library's own bytes are
///   tens of Mbit/s (the share measured on 2026-08-11: 31 Mbit/s — `docs/shared-servers.md` §2)
///   down a 2 Mbit/s pipe. The server cannot rescue it, because nothing is being transcoded and
///   so there is nothing for it to fit; the cap arrives as a stall two minutes into the film,
///   with the AU queue draining and no error on any surface. Forcing the transcode branch turns
///   that into a `/decision` the server answers with something that fits.
/// * **No container REMUX either** — the half that is easy to miss, because a remux *feels* like
///   a concession already. It is not: a remux copies the codecs and deliberately sends **no
///   cap** (`transcode_query` below omits `videoResolution`/`maxVideoBitrate` on that branch,
///   because a cap is exactly what would force the re-encode it is trying to avoid). So it ships
///   the same bytes at the same rate one layer down, and stalls identically. Denying it leaves
///   the re-encode, which is the only flavor whose whole point is that the server picks the rate.
///
/// **Not a parameter, deliberately — THIS policy sends no number at all.** A cap is meaningless on
/// direct play (no encoder is running to obey it) and on the re-encode branch the server already
/// receives an upper bound it is free to come in far under. The relay's real ceiling is known to
/// the server, which is on the other end of the tunnel and applies it; this policy's whole job is
/// to stop asking for the two flavors that leave it no way to.
///
/// This paragraph used to end "[`TranscodeSpec`] has no bitrate field and this does not add one",
/// and the spec grew [`Ceiling`] on 2026-08-23 — so read it as being about the RELAY, which is
/// what it always was. A **user-chosen** ceiling (`route::Quality`) is a different input through
/// the identical mechanism: `route::quality_policy` returns this same [`LinkPolicy`],
/// `route::flavors_allowed` composes the two so the stricter wins per flavor, and only then does a
/// number reach `transcode_query`. Nothing about the relay tier changed — it still denies both
/// flavors unconditionally and still names no rate.
///
/// **No relay connection has been observed on a device by this codebase.** Before discovery racing,
/// the old chooser discarded every relay. Relay is now a second-phase candidate, but the 2 Mbit/s
/// figure and port-8443 convention remain Plex documentation rather than our measurement, and this
/// policy is **unverified against a real relay** — `docs/shared-servers.md` §7 question 5. What is
