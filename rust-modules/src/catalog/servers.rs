//! The SERVER REGISTRY — every PMS this session knows about, which one is CURRENT, and the
//! `&'static Client` handed to ~30 call sites outside this module.
//!
//! This replaces `client.rs`'s `static PLEX: OnceLock<Client>`: one server per process, forever,
//! whose second `install` could only swap a token because its address was frozen by the first.
//! That single fact is what made browsing a SECOND (shared) server impossible — not the UI, not
//! the ops. So the singleton becomes a table, and `client()` becomes "the current entry of it"
//! with its signature untouched, which is why nothing outside `plex/` changed in the commit that
//! introduced this file.
//!
//! **Keyed by `machineIdentifier`.** The server's own permanent id is the only identity that
//! survives it changing address (LAN ↔ remote, DHCP, a relay), so the table keys on it and an
//! address is just where that key currently answers. [`install`] doesn't know the id — its callers
//! (`app.rs`, `auth.rs`) have only a stored session origin — so it registers with an EMPTY id and
//! matches on the origin; a later [`register_origin`] that does know the id adopts that slot
//! instead of adding a second one for the same server.
//!
//! **An address here is an [`Origin`], not a `(host, port)` pair** — scheme included, and parsed
//! from the URL plex.tv advertised rather than rebuilt from the address behind it (`origin.rs` has
//! the reasoning; the one-line version is that a `plex.direct` certificate is issued for the NAME).
//! [`register`] and [`register_with_client_id`] keep the pair-shaped spelling for callers that
//! genuinely hold nothing else, and say `Origin::http` out loud when they do.
//!
//! ## Why an atomic pointer table and not an `RwLock<Vec<Arc<Client>>>`
//!
//! `client()` is a HOT path: `app::adapters::poster::built_key` calls it three times per key, for every
//! visible art tile, every frame (~25–40 tiles × 60 fps). An `RwLock` there buys nothing and
//! costs an atomic RMW pair per call plus a fairness stall whenever a login writes; an `Arc`
//! clone would be a refcount bump per call on top of changing every call site's type. So a read
//! is: one acquire load of `CURRENT`, one acquire load of a slot pointer, deref. No lock, no
//! refcount, no allocation. Writers (login, profile switch, adding a server) serialize on
//! `WRITE`, which no reader ever touches.
//!
//! **Each slot's `Client` is LEAKED, deliberately.** It is what makes `&'static Client` sound
//! without an `Arc`: the reference handed out at frame N must stay valid even if a re-point
//! lands at frame N+1 while a worker thread is mid-request with it. Re-pointing publishes a
//! NEW leaked `Client` and stores its pointer over the old one, so the worst case for a caller
//! holding the previous reference is one request to the address that server used to be at —
//! never a use-after-free. The leak is bounded by [`MAX_SERVERS`] pointers' worth of small
//! structs for the life of the process (a household has a handful of servers, and registration
//! happens on login / profile switch / server switch, never per frame), so "bounded and never
//! freed" is cheaper than the refcount it replaces.
//!
//! ## Signing out: slots are REVOKED, never freed and never reused
//!
//! Because nothing is freed, a sign-out cannot remove a server from the table — and until
//! [`revoke_all`] existed nothing tried, so the account that signed out stayed in the table with
//! its live per-server tokens and the next account browsed, searched and built Home from BOTH.
//! [`revoke_all`] raises a [`FLOOR`]: every slot below it is dead — invisible to [`ids`], resolved
//! to `None` by [`client_for`], and blanked to an empty token so a `&'static Client` grabbed before
//! the sign-out cannot dial with the old one either. [`revoke_for_profile_switch`] uses the same
//! token blanking without raising the floor: it temporarily deactivates this account's slots, then
//! the newly granted roster reactivates only the machines that profile may use.
//!
//! **A revoked slot number is never handed out again**, not even to the same `machineIdentifier`.
//! [`ServerId`]'s whole contract is that it names one server for the life of the process — it sits
//! in UI state, in routes, in queued jobs — and every per-server store in the app (`search`'s
//! mailboxes, `serverinfo`, `person`'s per-source records) is a flat array indexed by
//! [`ServerId::raw`]. Reusing a number would file the previous account's results under the new
//! account's server, which is the very leak this exists to close. The cost is that sign-out /
//! sign-in cycles consume slots: past [`MAX_SERVERS`] registration is refused and says so in the
//! log, which for a table of 16 and a household of one or two servers is a great many sign-outs
//! inside one process.
