//! **Which addresses of a server are worth dialling, and in what order.** Pure policy: this module
//! builds and ranks candidate URLs from what plex.tv already told us, and does no I/O at all — no
//! socket, no thread, no clock. That is deliberate, and it is what makes the rules below testable
//! on the dev Mac (`cargo test --lib`) rather than only on a television.
//!
//! The rules are not cosmetic. A server hands us several addresses and **at most one of them is
//! reachable from where we are standing**; measured live 2026-08-11 against a real share
//! (`docs/shared-servers.md` §2), two of its three advertised connections cost 8 s and a DNS
//! failure respectively, and the third answered in 115 ms. Picking is the feature.
//!
//! Three rules, each earned:
//!
//! 1. **Gate a `local` connection on a NON-owned server unless `publicAddressMatches`.**
//!    `Connection.local` means "this address is RFC1918", *not* "you are on that LAN" — the share
//!    advertises the OWNER's `172.20.x.x`. Dialling it from here costs the full 8 s TLS connect
//!    deadline before the public candidate gets a turn, and the worse outcome is that it succeeds:
//!    `172.20.x.x` may be a *different machine on our own LAN*. TLS and the identity response make
//!    that success safe to reject. Keep the advertised TLS URI, whose certificate and identity can
//!    authenticate the answer, but never synthesize its plaintext twin. `publicAddressMatches` is
//!    the field that means what `local` looks like it means — with it true we really are behind the
//!    same NAT, so the plaintext address is ours to use too.
//! 2. **No plain-HTTP candidate when the owner set `httpsRequired`.** It is their setting; a plain
//!    request to such a server is a refusal, not a connection.
//! 3. **Rank local → remote → relay, and TLS before plaintext inside a tier.** The location order
//!    is the one every Plex client with an order uses: relay is a 2 Mbit/s tunnel the server
//!    transcodes down to fit, a last resort and never a preference. The SCHEME order flipped when
//!    the TLS control plane landed — https is the only connection a certificate can authenticate
//!    and the only one that works from outside the LAN, so it now leads (see
//!    [`Scheme`](super::origin::Scheme), whose declaration order IS this ranking). Then IPv4 before
//!    IPv6, and a numeric literal before a HOSTNAME ([`is_numeric_address`]) — a WEAKER tiebreak
//!    than it was, because both transports resolve names now, and one that is still worth having:
//!    a literal costs no DNS round trip, and on a LAN with no route to the internet it is the only
//!    thing that resolves at all.
//!
//! ## What a real prober must still do (this module cannot)
//!
//! - **Verify `machineIdentifier` on the response before accepting a connection.** A candidate that
//!   answered is not the server we asked for — rule 1 explains exactly how a stranger's box answers
//!   a probe. [`ProbePlan::machine_id`] is what the answer must equal; anything else is
//!   [`Outcome::WrongServer`] and the candidate is discarded, not retried. `/identity` is the right
//!   probe path: it is unauthenticated, so it answers 200 to anything — useless as a token test and
//!   perfect as a reachability + identity test.
//! - **Treat `401` as its own state, never as "unreachable"** ([`Outcome::Unauthorized`]). A
//!   parallel direct candidate—or the relay fallback—may still verify the machine, so one response
//!   does not stop the race. If no candidate verifies, the `accessToken` or access policy is the
//!   final problem: refetch `/api/v2/resources` rather than reporting "can't reach nas-home" and
//!   sending the user to their friend's router.
//!
//! The racing itself (parallel dial, first good activates, final best may re-point once) lives in
//! `auth.rs`; it belongs above this file, which stays a function of the resource alone.
