# catalog/ — the catalog facade (Plex-shaped DTOs over Jellyfin)

This is **`catalog::Client`**: the typed data layer screens, stores and the player still speak.
Field names (`ratingKey`, `MediaContainer`, `Metadata`, hub identifiers such as `home.continue`)
are the screenshot/replay contract, not a live Plex protocol. **Product traffic is Jellyfin** —
implemented in `crate::jf` (REST + convert) and installed after `screens/jf_login.rs`. Do not add
plex.tv, `X-Plex-Token`, or PMS REST callers on the product path.

The HTTP client is `client.rs` (one server) and the registry that holds them is `servers.rs`.
Library/hubs/metadata reads (`library.rs`/`hubs.rs`/`models.rs`) and playback ops (`transcoder.rs`,
`timeline.rs`) stay here as the facade; `route/` holds playback *state* (`decision.rs`) + policy
(`plan.rs`), never a query string. Jellyfin endpoints belong in `jf/`.

Historical notes below describe the PlxNative PMS + plex.tv client this module was renamed from.
Treat them as design history for leftover types (`origin`, `grant`, `account`, `probe`) that may
still compile; they are not the product boot path.

## The guiding principle: direct-play first

The whole point of this client is that **the TV plays the library natively**. Prefer a **direct-play**
part over a transcode wherever the TV can decode it; when a transcode is unavoidable, request it as a
**progressive stream the existing demuxer already handles** (H264+AC3 MKV) rather than inventing a new
container/codec path. Every "just transcode it" shortcut pushes work onto the server *and* degrades
quality — reach for it only when direct-play genuinely can't work. See `[[server-hevc-encode-gating]]`
and the `soft-subs` note below for why "direct-play everything" keeps paying off.

## More than one server: the registry (`servers.rs`)

**A friend's shared server is not a second address, it is a second AUTHORITY** — its own
`machineIdentifier`, its own per-(user, server) `accessToken`, its own `ratingKey` space and its own
watch state. Measured live against a real share (`docs/shared-servers.md` §2): our own server's
token gets a **401** from it, and its section key `1` is a different library from our section key
`1`. So this layer is keyed on servers, not on one host and port.

`client()` and `client_opt()` still mean what they always did, they just mean **the CURRENT
credential-eligible server** now — which is why nothing outside `plex/` changed when the
`OnceLock<Client>` singleton became a table. `client_for(id)` is the multi-server addition;
`register_origin(machine_id, &Origin, token, Option<&ResolvePin>, ConnectionFacts)` puts a server
in the table. **`install(&Origin, token, Option<&ResolvePin>, ConnectionFacts)` is the SESSION
path** (boot, QR login, profile switch) and retargets when the origin may carry a credential — it
grew the fourth parameter in #95 step 8: `ConnectionFacts{tier, ip}` is
applied to the published `Client` INSIDE the same registration write that creates or re-points its
slot, never as a separate post-hoc `set_link`/`set_connection` call a caller could forget or a
re-point could race. `None` in either field means **leave unchanged**, not "set unknown" — a
same-origin retoken that knows nothing new about the connection passes `ConnectionFacts::default()`
and the client's prior tier/IP survive; only a re-point (a genuinely fresh `Client`, which
`Client::new` starts at `LINK_UNKNOWN`/`IP_UNKNOWN` regardless) or an explicit `Some` actually
changes what's stored. `register_origin` takes `ConnectionFacts` directly rather than keeping a
connection-less twin beside it; `register_captured_origin_with_connection` is the `pub(crate)` seam
that carries it through the other registration paths (dev boot, `install_captured_registry`'s
primary and extras, the endpoint/roster/candidate-activation handlers in `auth.rs`); every one of
them derives the IP family from the candidate's own advertised `address`, never `Origin::host()` —
a `plex.direct` origin's host is a certificate NAME `IpVersion::of_host` cannot parse as a literal,
which is why that used to read `unknown` on almost every real boot (issue #95's R3(a)).

**A server's address is an `Origin` — scheme + host + port — and it is PARSED FROM A URL, never
assembled from an address.** `net/origin.rs` is the type and the reasoning (it lives in the transport so the
transport can read it; `plex/origin.rs` re-exports it and keeps `CredentialPolicy`); the short version is that
plex.tv advertises a server's TLS origin as the `plex.direct` HOSTNAME (`Connection.uri`) while
`Connection.address` stays the dotted quad behind it, and the certificate is issued for the name —
so a control plane carrying only an address can never validate one, however much TLS is added
underneath it. `probe::Candidate::origin()` is the one derivation, and `Candidate::address` survives
only as what a log and the Sources panel SAY. Two invariants come with it: `Origin::host()` is
**always unbracketed** (it is the `getaddrinfo` node) while `Origin::authority()` **always**
brackets a v6 literal (it is URL serialization) — confusing the two makes URL construction keep
looking right while name resolution quietly stops working. `register(machine_id, host, port, token)`
and `Origin::http(host, port)` still exist and are honest about what they mean: **every caller of
either is a place that still assumes cleartext**, which is what makes them the grep for the TLS
work. The CONTROL plane no longer makes that assumption: `http.rs` sends an HTTPS origin through
libcurl. Neither does playback: `StreamUrl` preserves the scheme and `ff.rs` selects `stream.rs`
for plaintext or `curlio.rs` for HTTPS. One dev-only caller also still throws an origin away:
`metadata.rs`'s `alt_stand_in_slot` registers a stand-in from `c.host()`/`c.port()` and must move
to `register_origin`. (It was `ui/alt_sources.rs`'s until restructure phase 10 moved the *Also
available* store to the data layer beside the resolve that fills it.)

**A `plex.direct` origin is dialled at the address plex.tv advertised beside it, with no DNS.**
`origin::ResolvePin` (2026-09-05) is the offline-mode fix: the persisted origin for the household's
own server is normally `https://192-168-0-10.<hash>.plex.direct:32400`, a name only Plex's public
zone resolves, so a LAN whose uplink was down could not reach a server one hop away — and the
plaintext twin `probe::candidates` documents as "the offline fallback" cannot carry a token in a
store build (`http::credential_transport_allowed`; a consented `grant` needs a fresh plex.tv
resource list, which an offline boot does not have). A pin is built ONLY when the dashed label
encodes the stored `address` (v4 or the eight-group v6 spelling), so it is a pure function of the
hostname; `register_origin`/`install` take it, the `Client` carries it for the control plane, and
`net::resolve` holds an append-only table the media plane (`curlio`) consults by host and port.
TLS validation is untouched here: the name stays in the URL and in SNI. (The only relaxation of CA
verification on the ordinary request path, issue #378's key mode below, is a separate and narrower rule about a wrong clock; a pin
changes where an address comes from and nothing about what is trusted.) `/tmp/nativejelly-nowan` makes
every unpinned name fail as a dead resolver would, which is how the case is reproduced on a desk.
**Since issue #95 the DISCOVERY PROBE is pinned too, not only the winning `Client`.**
`auth::race_batch` builds a `ResolvePin` for each `https://…plex.direct` candidate from the same
`Candidate::address` this module already carries, and hands it down through `auth::get_identity` to
`http::request_probe`'s (or `request_probe_learning_key`'s) TLS arm — the identical mechanism `register_origin`/`install` use, run one
step earlier, at the DIAL that decides a winner rather than only after one is already decided. That
is what turns a router's DNS-rebind protection (which answers every `*.plex.direct` name with
NXDOMAIN, so the probe's own resolver never reaches the LAN candidate) from a permanent relay
detour into an ordinary pinned LAN HTTPS winner; the plaintext twin's own probe is unaffected — a
pin belongs to a TLS name, never to a literal — and a candidate whose dashed label does not encode
its `address` simply gets no pin and resolves through DNS exactly as before.

**The probe also learns each server's leaf public key (issue #380); issue #378's key mode reads it.** While
online, over a connection libcurl verified in full (`Tls::Ca`, never the lab's pinned mode), an
`/identity` answer that `auth::classify` accepts for the machine asked for makes
`ProbeReply::grade_learning` record that machine's pin — `sha256//<base64>`, the exact
`CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY` string `spki::pin_from_pem` makes of the chain's index-0 certificate, read
through `CURLINFO_CERTINFO` (`net::peer_leaf_pin`) only when the request opts in
(`http::request_probe_learning_key`; the option makes libcurl decode the whole chain, so no ordinary
request pays). **Only an origin that has a `ResolvePin` opts in** — `auth::get_identity` picks
`request_probe_learning_key` when it holds a pin and plain `http::request_probe` otherwise, the one
place the rule is spelled. The dashed `*.plex.direct` names are the only origins the offline fallback
can ever apply to, and a custom server-access URL behind a proxy with its own certificate would
otherwise rewrite the machine's single entry on every discovery. Plaintext, a failed verification,
a mismatched `machineIdentifier`, an origin without a pin and a relay route (skipped as a
conservative choice) learn nothing. It lives in `Session::server_key_pins`, one entry per
`machineIdentifier`, session-level like `plaintext_consent` (NOT in `ServerRef`/`SourceRef`/
`ProfileCreds`, which are cloned per profile), soft-parsed and skipped while empty.
**It is in the PUBLIC preferences, so sign-out forgets it by an explicit rule, not with the
credentials:** `Mutation::ClearTenure` retains `public.preferences` whole except the keys in
`storage::state::ACCOUNT_BOUND_PREFERENCES` (`server_key_pins`), so sign-out — and "Delete all
local data", which runs it first — leaves the stored record with no learned key, and the next account to sign in opens with none
(`migration_tests::helper_signout_forgets_the_learned_server_keys_and_the_next_account_inherits_none`).
`session::learn_server_key` queues the write only when the pin changed.
`Session::server_key_pin(machine_id)` is the accessor.

**Key mode (issue #378): the remembered key stands in for the chain-and-date check.** The television
has no battery clock, so a valid `*.plex.direct` certificate can read as expired (or not yet valid)
before NTP has run, and the strict handshake then fails with rc 60 and `CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT`
10 (expired) or 9 (not yet valid). When that is the failure libcurl reported, and `net::keypin` holds
a remembered key for that exact `host:port`, the request is repeated once with
`CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY` set to it, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` 0 and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` still 2.
What is relaxed is the chain-and-date check; what still holds is that the leaf's name matches the
host dialled and that its public key hashes to the remembered one (a different key is rc 90, never
served). **The security of key mode rests on the key pin plus the name check, and on nothing the date
check used to imply.** Three facts follow, and none of them is hidden: (1) verify result 9/10 does
NOT prove the date was the only problem, because OpenSSL stops at the first error it meets walking
the chain, so an untrusted issuer behind an expired leaf also reads as 10; (2) key mode engages for a
genuinely expired certificate on a CORRECT clock too, since the trigger is the verify result and
never a judgement about the clock; (3) the remembered key has no expiry of its own, it lasts as long
as the session that holds it. A different verify result (untrusted issuer reported first, wrong name,
revoked, a valid leaf) never enters key mode, and neither does plex.tv, a host with no remembered key,
or a plaintext URL. `net::keypin::apply` sets the pin FIRST and checks it: `VERIFYPEER` goes to 0
only after libcurl accepted the pin, so a libcurl that refuses the option leaves the request strict
and failed, and `confirm` then compares the presented leaf's key itself (via `CERTINFO`) in case a TLS
backend accepts the option and never enforces it. Every key-mode handle also sets
`CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT` and `CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE`, so it always does its own handshake (a reused
keep-alive connection has no certificate to confirm) at the price of one handshake per key-mode
request. A key-mode answer is never learned from (`peer_pin` is never read), so key mode cannot
rewrite what it is checking against.
**One table, filled once:** `net::keypin` is process-wide, keyed by lowercase `host:port`, with
replace semantics. `session::replace_cache` is the single choke point that projects the session
into it (`session::project_server_keys`: each machine's key bound to the hosts of the stored
`session.server` and `session.sources` that carry a `ResolvePin`); `servers::register_lazy` binds a
machine registered at runtime; a key `session::learn_server_key` learns reaches the table only when its
queued write is applied and projected (the projection is the only production source of a key; `register_lazy` only binds hosts);
sign-out empties it (revoked/missing/cleared sessions project nothing). Both stacks share
the decision and the option code: the control plane in `net::request_tls_evidence`, the media plane
in `curlio::CurlSource::start_range_until`, which every open, reopen and seek goes through. After a
key-mode success the host is LATCHED for 10 minutes on the monotonic clock (later requests skip the
doomed strict handshake; the timer does not slide; a strict success or a changed pin clears it; rc 90
in key mode clears it and is the failure). The log carries one line when a host first engages, with
the year the device believes it is, and one for rc 90, and never a pin or a host:port. The same
decisions also publish facts the app polls (`keypin::engaged`, `blocked_for(machine)`, `revision`;
per host and asked per machine; a host's fact is its latest strict outcome, cleared by its success,
a pin change or, for "no key", a later strict failure that is not about the date), and the first engagement of an app run raises ONE
television toast (`app::clock_notice`; never retried, host-tested only until the set accepts it).

**The who's-watching pick is seated from `Session::profiles` when plex.tv does not answer.** The
first real outage (2026-09-06, `docs/measurements/offline-picker-red-tv-2026-09-06.log`) got past
the pinned origin and then could seat nobody: every pick is a `POST /api/v2/home/users/{uuid}/switch`,
and the one no-network shortcut (re-picking the active, PIN-free profile) did not cover a house
whose active profile is the PIN-protected admin. So every ONLINE seating now writes a
`ProfileCreds` record — user, primary, roster, and for a protected profile a `PinVerifier`
(PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 under a random salt, `nj_base::sha256`; never the PIN) — and
`auth::switch_thread` reads `account::SwitchOutcome`: plex.tv's verdict (`Refused`) ends the
switch as before, `Unreachable` falls through to `auth::offline_activation`, which seats a cached
unprotected profile on the pick and a cached protected one on its PIN, and a profile this set has
never seated online says so: "No internet connection. Pick this profile once while online, and it
will work offline." (The QR screen carries the same sentence about signing in.) `account::plex_tv_recently_unreachable` (a 45 s
memo the picker's own roster refresh usually fills) sends the pick to the cache FIRST so an
outage does not cost a connect timeout per pick. Three simulator runs in `docs/measurements/
offline-picker-sim-*-2026-09-06.log`, and `tests/run.py`'s `offline_pick_cached` on the set.

**A candidate only becomes the LIVE origin if this build can put a token on it.** The probe race
used to activate "the first usable answer immediately", and on a LAN the plaintext twin answers
before the TLS handshake completes — so a store build re-pointed its live server to an origin it
then refused (`security: refused plaintext PMS credentials`) for the ~100 ms until the https winner
landed, and whatever was in flight (a hub fetch, the picker's first avatar) failed for good. Issue
#95's fix is that eligibility is decided once, at synthesis, not asked again at activation:
`probe::candidates` stamps each `Candidate::credential_eligible` from the `CredentialPolicy` the
plan was built with, and only an eligible answer can become `first`/`best`/get activated — a
verified plaintext answer in a store build does **not** count as reached and does not hold back the
relay leg. If nothing eligible verifies, the result is `Reach::InsecureOnly` (plan §4's precedence:
`At` > `InsecureOnly` > `Refused` > `No`), which becomes `Outcome::InsecureOnly` /
`Discovery::InsecureOnly` / `SourceState::InsecureOnly` ("Not secure") — a fifth sentence, told
apart from `Unreachable`, that **outranks a 401**. Before this it counted as reached, which was
issue #95 itself.

**"May a credential go to this origin" has ONE answer: `grant::credential_allowed`** (or
`grant::allowed_under` where a pure function receives the policy). It is the build's
`CredentialPolicy` OR a live `PlaintextGrant` for that exact origin (PLX-NATIVE-10). Whoever puts a
particular SERVER's token on an origin — registry and endpoint admission — asks
`grant::allowed_for(policy, machine_id, origin)`: a grant admits only the machine it was minted
for. A remembered (cached) origin asks `grant::remembered_allowed`: the policy alone, never a
grant. Nothing else
asks `CredentialPolicy::may_carry_credential` or `Origin::is_tls` for a credential decision —
`grep -rn may_carry_credential src/` finds only `grant.rs` (plus doc links). `probe::candidates`
stamps the policy half at synthesis, and `auth::settle_plaintext` adds the grant half after the
race. A Plex grant is minted only by discovery (a Jellyfin server's by `jf::plaintext`, after the person
allowed it and the server's anonymous `/System/Info/Public` named it at that origin — `grant`'s
*Jellyfin grants*), from a FRESH verdict `InsecureEvidence::
plaintext_eligibility` calls eligible, when the person's recorded answer (`Session::
plaintext_consent`, captured at the spawn site as `grant::PlaintextAsk`) allows it; it is bound to
{identity generation, network generation, machine, exact numeric origin}, never persisted, dies on
sign-in/sign-out, on every DID foreground (which queues each stranded server's endpoint
re-discovery, requested by `grant::UpgradeRetry::due`), on a refusal (which also moves the consent generation
a `PlaintextAsk` captured) and on a roster commit that does not install its (machine, origin) —
a roster commit moves no generation — and a stored `SourceRef` naming a
plaintext origin registers tokenless until discovery re-mints. Ending a grant re-grades the
registry (`servers::regrade_credentials` blanks every client a grant was carrying, `ON_GRANT`);
`grant::UpgradeRetry` re-discovers a granted server on the hub-retry backoff and the HTTPS
registration retires the grant (`auth::retire_grant_on_https`).

**Online primary selection also proves the token after it proves the machine.** `/identity` is
deliberately unauthenticated, so a fresh identity winner is only a known endpoint. Before sign-in,
rediscovery or a profile switch may select it as primary, auth sends `GET /library/sections`
through that source's exact origin, resolve pin, transport policy and per-machine token. A valid
empty sections container is success; 401/403, timeout, transport refusal and malformed JSON remain
distinct evidence, and primary selection continues with the next eligible endpoint/server.
Secondary servers keep the profile-specific grants plex.tv returned live and cached; their identity
probes refresh endpoint and reachability facts without making every secondary browse before it can
be registered. Direct identity candidates settle as one race, and a relay fallback receives its own
local/remote probe opportunity. Authenticated fallback attempts share a separate 20-second budget,
with each request still capped at 5 seconds for Local and 10 seconds for Remote/Relay. Only time
inside those authenticated requests is deducted: identity probing (including later direct/cached
or relay attempts) and inter-server pacing do not spend admission time. Offline cached-profile
seating keeps its existing PIN/cache contract.

Slots are keyed on `machineIdentifier` because that is the only identity that survives a server
changing address — and a registration that has *learned* an id **adopts** an address-only slot
instead of adding a second one for the same machine.

Three design choices carry the weight, and each is a prevented bug rather than a preference:

- **An atomic-pointer table, not an `RwLock`.** `client()` is a HOT path: `app::adapters::poster::built_key`
  calls it **three times per key, for every visible art tile, every frame** (~25–40 tiles × 60 fps).
  A read is one relaxed load, one acquire load, a deref — no lock, no refcount, no allocation. An
  `RwLock` would add an atomic RMW pair per call plus a fairness stall every time a login writes,
  and an `Arc` would change every call site's type to buy a refcount bump per tile per frame.
- **Each slot's `Client` is LEAKED, deliberately.** That is what makes handing out `&'static
  Client` sound without an `Arc`: the reference a worker took at frame N must still be valid when a
  re-point lands at frame N+1 with that worker mid-request. Re-pointing publishes a NEW leaked
  `Client` over the pointer, so the worst case for the old reference is **one request sent to where
  that server used to be** — never a dangling pointer, which is the failure that has no debugger on
  this device. The leak is bounded: a handful of small structs, written on login / profile switch /
  server switch, never per frame.
- **Token generations come from a process-global sequence, so no two clients ever share one.**
  `token_gen` was a single process-wide counter, which cannot express "server B's token changed".
  Its only reader is `app::adapters::poster::built_key`'s memo and that memo compares **one number** — so two
  servers whose generations happened to agree would mean that the moment `client()` started
  answering with B, the memo said nothing had changed and served B its cards from **A's memoised,
  token-bearing paths**. Uniqueness makes "did this number move" also answer "is this even the same
  server".

## Granted, pinned, reachable — three states, and never the same question

The whole shared-source feature rests on keeping these apart:

- **granted** — plex.tv's answer. `/api/v2/resources` says this account may use this server and
  hands over the `accessToken` that proves it. Not a setting of ours; it is the owner's decision.
- **pinned** — the only thing the USER controls, it governs **every browsing surface**, and it is
  **per Plex Home PROFILE**. The user reads it as **Favorite libraries**; the identifier and the
  persisted `Session::home_pins` key keep their names on purpose (renaming the key would break
  rollback, not upgrade). It governed **Home alone** until 2026-09-05 and this paragraph said so;
  the owner's direction was that the setting affects the whole app. What reads it: Home's shelves,
  the top tab STRIP (a type with no favourite library draws no pill), and the Library's Sources
  picker. What does NOT: the browse grid, sort, the A–Z rail and the item pages, which are all
  downstream of a library you already chose — and **Search**, which stays grant-scoped and only
  RANKS favourites first, because a browsing preference is not an authorization boundary and
  removing results would invent a false negative for a film the user owns and can play. The
  unscoped list survives as `browse::all_source_rows`, which is the Favorite libraries editor's, and
  is the only way a non-favourite comes back. The rules are `pins.rs` (pure); the store is keyed by
  the profile's `uuid`; the page that asks once is `AppArg::Onboard` (`Route::Onboard` before
  restructure phase 12 (D1) retired `enum Route`), first-run *Favorite
  libraries* — `ui::onboard` through phase 4, `screens::onboard`'s owned `OnboardScreen` since
  phase 5b (2026-09-07); reached again later from Settings it is a page of that family rather than
  this same route (`SettingsPage::Favourites` — the enum lives in `screens/family.rs`, not
  `screens/settings.rs` — hosting the same screen type). Owner's ruling, 2026-08-21 — "it
  is separate for each profile" — and it hung off the whole `Session` (one per install) before that.
- **reachable** — a fact about NOW: something answered at one of its addresses, *as the right
  machine*. It changes while nobody touches anything, and it is never a reason to forget the grant
  or the pin.

Collapsing any two of them produces a specific wrong behaviour rather than a vague one. A `401` is
the final answer only when no parallel direct or fallback relay candidate verifies the machine; at
that point reading it as "unreachable" sends the user to the router when the fix is to refetch
`/resources` or correct the access policy. An unreachable server read as un-granted drops the
source out of the Sources list, so there is nothing left to retry.
A pinned-but-dead source drawn as a shelf is a spinner that never ends — the design's answer is that
a dead source is **absent** from Home and states itself in its own library section instead.

## Gotchas that bite (all verified in code)

- **A hub's `title` is PMS's own localized text — except for the standard hubs, which this app
  now overrides client-side at BOTH scopes it draws hubs on.** `hubs.rs`/`models.rs`'s
  `Hub::title` still carries whatever PMS sent, but neither `screens/home/mod.rs` nor a library's
  own browse grid renders it verbatim: `plex::hub_title::localized_hub_title` is the ONE shared
  table both `pms.rs::project` (Home's `/hubs` merge) and `browse::section_hubs::parse_hubs` (a
  library's own `/hubs/sections/{id}`) call, so the two cannot drift apart, parameterized by a
  `hub_title::Scope` (`Home` / `Section`) because PMS itself titles the "Recently Added" family
  differently at the two endpoints. For a hubIdentifier the catalog recognizes it substitutes a
  client-side string, **unconditionally**, the same way `home.continue`'s title never came from
  PMS at all (`i18n::msg::browse_home_continue_watching()`, set where the dedicated
  `/hubs/continueWatching` deck becomes a `HubRow`):
  - Home: `home.ondeck`/`home.onDeck` → "On Deck", `home.playlists` → "Recent Playlists"; the 5
    whole-server `home.*.recent` ids → a per-type string ("Recently Added Movies") when the id
    names the household's ONLY hub of that type in the response (`pms.rs::project` counts
    `hubIdentifier` occurrences before choosing — `hub_identifier_counts`), else (PMS minted more
    than one, or the id is a numbered `movie.recentlyadded.<id>`/`show.recentlyadded.<id>`/
    `tv.recentlyadded.<id>`) → "Recently Added in {library}" using the hub's own
    `librarySectionTitle`.
  - Section: the same `*.recentlyadded.<id>` family → plain "Recently Added", no library name —
    the section page already is that library, and PMS itself drops the qualifier at this scope
    (§3a). A per-section deck (`*.inprogress.<id>`) and every id this catalog has not specifically
    enumerated keep PMS's title verbatim at this scope too.

  `client.rs::headers`/`pms_headers` still send the literal selected UI tag
  (`identity::language()`) as `X-Plex-Language` on every PMS operation, hubs included, which the
  `pms_headers_carry_the_literal_selected_ui_language_be_included` test pins for `en`/`es`/`be` —
  that header behavior is unchanged, only what each screen does with the *response* changed. A
  Home screen with SOME hub titles translated into the selected language and others not (issue
  #12, a Belarusian UI mixing `be` and ru/en titles) was PMS's own per-string translation coverage
  for that tag answering back on every shelf; it now answers back only on a hubIdentifier this
  catalog has never enumerated — a custom collection shelf (`custom.collection.*`), a rotating
  genre/actor rail, or a promoted rail under an id nothing here recognizes, which still renders
  `hub.title` verbatim because there is no substitute catalog for arbitrary server-owned text (and
  no live evidence any of those families need one). `metadata.rs`'s `CollectionShelf` is the one
  Hub-title consumer that deliberately does NOT go through this table: a collection's own name is
  server-owned exactly the way a movie's title is, not a standard shelf heading, so it keeps
  `h.title.clone()` verbatim by design. See `docs/pms-api.md` §3/§3a for the full table and the
  tests (`pms_multi_source_merge_tests.rs`:
  `a_recently_added_library_hub_renders_the_be_catalog_string_under_a_be_ui`,
  `one_movie_and_one_tv_library_get_the_natural_per_type_recently_added_titles`,
  `a_lone_movie_library_renders_the_be_per_type_catalog_string_under_a_be_ui`,
  `an_unrecognized_hub_identifier_keeps_the_pms_title_verbatim`; `section_hubs.rs`:
  `a_be_ui_localizes_the_section_recently_added_hub_and_leaves_an_unknown_one_alone`); don't infer
  a different PMS-side fallback chain from one field report without a live server to verify it
  against.
- **`Connection.local` does not mean what it looks like, and the cost is a probe deadline.** It means
  "this address is RFC1918", NOT "you are on that LAN" — a share advertises the *owner's*
  `172.20.x.x`. `publicAddressMatches` is the field that means the latter. For an unmatched
  non-owned connection, `probe.rs` retains only an advertised HTTPS URI and suppresses plaintext:
  TLS plus the `/identity` response can authenticate the answer, while plaintext could succeed
  against a different machine at the same address on our LAN. That is also why a probe must
  **verify `machineIdentifier` on the response** before accepting a connection, and why `probe.rs`
  is pure (no socket, no clock): the rules are then gradeable on the dev Mac.
- **A ceiling is answered by the transcode FLAVOR *first*, and only then by a parameter.** Plex's
  relay is a ~2 Mbit/s tunnel, so `transcoder::link_policy` denies direct play *and* the container
  remux over one — the remux is the half that is easy to miss, since it copies the codecs and
  deliberately sends no cap, i.e. the same bytes at the same rate one layer down. **No relay
  connection has ever been observed by this codebase**, so that policy is reasoned, not measured;
  read its doc before touching it.
  `TranscodeSpec` grew a `ceiling` field on 2026-08-23 and this bullet used to end "and must not
  grow one" — which was right about a LINK ceiling and wrong as a general rule. A **user-chosen**
  ceiling (`route::Quality`, the picker in the player's `…` menu, for LG checklist #43 CASE1) is a
  different input with the identical mechanism: `route::quality_policy` returns the same two flags
  `link_policy` does, `route::flavors_allowed` composes them so the stricter wins, and only once
  direct play and the remux are BOTH denied does a rate reach the WIRE. Note the field itself rides
  EVERY spec, remux included — `transcode_query` reads it on the re-encode branch alone, and the
  remux branch's silence is an invariant a host test pins, not a `None` you can rely on. The rule that
  survives unchanged is the ORDER: a number that is not preceded by a flavour refusal does nothing
  at all, because the flavour it would have bound is the one with no encoder in it.
- **Capture the server at the SPAWN SITE**, the rule the multi-server work inherits from
  `route::ResolveEnv` — whose doc says why in general: a worker reads no `static mut`, because the
  main thread reassigns those under it. "Which server is current" is exactly such a value, and a
  worker that asks *after* the user switched lands an answer belonging to the other machine's
  `ratingKey` space. Pass a `ServerId` (or the `&'static Client`) in with the job. One narrow
  exception exists today and is worth knowing rather than copying: `build_stream` reads
  `client_opt()` on the resolve worker. That is sound — the registry read is atomic and its clients
  are never freed — but it means "the current server", not "the server this play started from", and
  it is the line to change when a play can begin on a server that is not current.

- **Content negotiation: send `Accept: application/json` explicitly.** PMS returns **XML** for
  `Accept: */*` (or no Accept), and only JSON for an explicit `application/json`. A request that
  forgets it silently gets XML → the JSON parser finds no `Metadata` → **0 items, empty home**. The
  raw-socket `stream.rs` used to force `*/*` on every request; the client sends JSON Accept unless the
  caller overrides it (playback/part/photo endpoints ignore Accept).
- **PMS string-encodes numbers, so deserializers must be lenient.** Fields like `size`/`viewOffset`/
  `duration` arrive as JSON **strings** (`"1234"`) on some endpoints and **numbers** on others; some
  bools (`Stream.default`/`selected`) arrive as `true`/`false` *and* as `"1"`/`"0"`. Every numeric
  field goes through `de_i64`/`de_f64` (in `models.rs`) whose untagged enum accepts int **and** string
  **and** bool. Omitting a lenient adapter doesn't just drop one field — serde fails the **whole
  `MediaContainer`** parse → empty result. When you add a model field, use the lenient adapter.
- **The session file has FOUR writers and exactly one door for changing part of it.** `session.rs`'s
  `update(|s| …)` does the read-modify-write under the module's own lock and writes through a
  sibling tmp + `rename`; `save` is a whole-file REPLACE for the two flows that own the entire file
  (sign-in, profile switch). Reach for `update` for anything that touches one field — the roster,
  the search terms — because the others are workers and the two failures are both silent: a lost
  update resumes the next boot as the wrong profile, and a torn `O_TRUNC` write is an unparseable
  file, which is a QR code on the next boot rather than a stale roster. The lock (`IO`) is held
  across the write's `sync_all`, so **nothing per-frame may take it directly** — but a per-frame
  reader may now call `session::peek()`, because `peek()` is backed by a live in-memory read
  cache, not a per-call file transaction.
- **`session::peek()` is a write-through cache over the persisted session, not a fresh read.** A
  hit is one uncontended `Mutex` lock and an `Arc<Session>` clone — no `IO`, no helper round trip —
  which is what makes it safe to call every frame (`player::preview::enabled` does). The invariants
  that keep it correct, all in `session.rs`'s module doc and worth knowing before touching either
  the cache or a write path:
  - Cached records come from completed reads or durable writes under `IO`. `Revoked` separately
    suppresses credentials immediately during a queued sign-out, even if its disk clear fails.
    Reads and preference edits preserve it; only an explicit proven credential write ends it.
  - Only `session.rs` writes the session domain of the record; every `persistence::commit_*`/
    `write_session`/`commit_cleared` caller updates the cache through a read install, proven-write
    install, cache drop, or local revocation. Read installs cannot undo revocation.
  - `peek` never takes `IO`, including on a miss. It returns the previous snapshot and schedules
    one refresh on `storage_worker`'s bounded FIFO. The worker reads and installs under `IO`,
    then advances a visible-session generation only if the served content changed. The bridge
    observes it and invalidates on the frame thread. Cached views also observe it through
    `VisibleSessionWatch` (or include `visible_generation()` in their cache key) and rebuild;
    invalidating drawing alone cannot refresh a retained value. `peek_settled()` keeps transient
    reads distinct from an authoritative empty session. Unchanged retries remain quiet. A queued
    read cannot overwrite a newer write or sign-out.
  - Writers never read the cache to decide what to write — they always re-read the authority under
    `IO` first (the fence/OCC check), then install their own proven outcome. A miss can therefore
    never overwrite a newer concurrent write.
  - A `Locked`/`Blocked` read (keymanager unavailable, a helper hiccup) is cached only
    transiently, for `LOCKED_RETRY` (about a second) after completion — never latched forever the way a naive
    per-field cache once was (the bug PR #120's stopgap shipped and this cache replaced).
  - Sign-out (`clear()`) drops the cached `Arc` immediately; the tokens it held must not remain
    reachable in memory after a sign-out just because nothing had overwritten the cache yet.
  - `plex::session::async_persistence`'s Stage B coordinator is unwired and keeps its own,
    separate `CACHE` today; when it is wired up, it must install into/drop the cache above
    (`install_locked`/`drop_cache_locked`, under `IO`) instead of maintaining a second copy of the
    session.
- **Track selection is server-side, via `PUT /library/parts/{id}`** (set the chosen audio/subtitle
  stream + subtitle burn), **not** query params on the stream URL. The server re-selects for the next
  decision; the client re-requests the part. See `[[audio-subtitle-track-switching]]`.
- **Subtitles: the client renders them, and a conversion burns only what it must.** Direct play
  draws the file's own track. A conversion asks for the selected subtitle and the PlaybackInfo
  answer says how it arrives (`MediaStream.DeliveryMethod` → `jf::playback::SubtitleDelivery`): a
  text track as the server's extracted file (`External`, drawn by the sidecar renderer), a bitmap
  track muxed into the converted Matroska (`Embed`, ordinal 0 of the output), or burned
  (`Encode`). The ask never forces a burn. `docs/jellyfin-playback.md` "Subtitles" has the table.

## Where the bytes go next

This layer only *decides and locates*; the actual byte stream (direct-play or transcode) is pulled
through `stream.rs` or `curlio.rs`, demuxed by `ff.rs`, and fed to Starfish by the `player/` engine
— see `player/CLAUDE.md` for the Load-payload/codec and subtitle-rendering rules on the other side
of the handoff. The old hand-rolled `mkv.rs` path is retired.
