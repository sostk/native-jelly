//! **The Plex layer's door onto the origin types, and the credential policy that is about them.**
//!
//! [`Origin`] (scheme + host + port), [`Scheme`], [`ResolvePin`], [`split`], [`url_host`] and
//! [`plex_direct_literal`] are defined in [`nj_net::net::origin`] and re-exported here, so every
//! Plex caller keeps naming `plex::Origin` and `plex::origin::split`. They moved down because the
//! transport — `net`'s request funnel and `stream`'s redirect follower — has to read them, and a
//! transport must not name the layer above it (`docs/module-layers.md`, step L6). Their own
//! documentation, the bracket rule and the `plex.direct` pin rules included, is there.
//!
//! What stays is [`CredentialPolicy`]: whether a credential may ride an origin is a Plex decision
//! (`super::grant` holds the live half), and it only READS an [`Origin`].

/// **The build's half of "may a credential ride this origin".** The question itself has ONE
/// answer, `super::grant::credential_allowed` (or `grant::allowed_under` in a pure function that
/// receives this value): this policy, OR a live consented plaintext grant for that exact origin
/// (PLX-NATIVE-10). Every caller that used to carry its own `cfg!(feature = "devtriggers")` (the
/// http guard, the curlio media twin, the probe activation gate) now goes through it, and
/// [`CredentialPolicy::build`] is the ONLY place the cfg still lives.
///
/// A store build is [`CredentialPolicy::HttpsOnly`]: by policy a token may only ride a TLS origin
/// (a grant is the one exception, and it lives in `grant`, not here). A
/// developer build (`devtriggers`) is [`CredentialPolicy::AllowPlaintext`]: the rule exists so a
/// lane with no TLS server of its own can still exercise the credentialed path against a plain
/// `dev::DevServer` — unless `/tmp/nativejelly-storepolicy` was armed at boot, which
/// gives a developer build the store's `HttpsOnly` so the consent flow (reachable only under it)
/// can be exercised in the sim and on the TV. The trigger only ever tightens, and a store build
/// has no trigger to read. Nothing about WHICH origin is eligible ever depends on where the policy came
/// from — a pure function receives it as a parameter. [`build`](CredentialPolicy::build) itself is
/// no longer just the two discovery live edges (`auth::resolve_roster_live_while`,
/// `auth::probe_profile_resource_live`): the registry asks it too, at every write that admits an
/// origin — `servers::register_origin`, `servers::register_captured_origin_with_connection` and
/// `servers::register_pinned_with_client_id` — so a stored origin is graded by the same rule a
/// discovered one is, and the transport boundary (`http::credential_transport_allowed`) still asks
/// it a third time, per request, as the backstop if either ever admitted one wrongly.
