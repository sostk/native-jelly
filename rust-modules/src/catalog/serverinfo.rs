//! What the connected server says about ITSELF — its version and whether its owner holds a
//! **Plex Pass** — held as process state for the diagnostics surfaces.
//!
//! Exists because of issue #22: a free server cannot encode HEVC, dropped the video track, and
//! the app "had no idea such a thing existed" — the reviewer derived the cause from the server's
//! own transcoder logs. The Plex Pass audit (`docs/plex-pass-audit.md`) names the bug class this
//! kills: a claim true on the development environment (a Pass'd server) asserted as universal.
//! This module is the app finally *knowing*, so `app::diagnostics` can print it and
//! `player::error_shape` can name the cause in words.
//!
//! **Visibility only, never behavior.** Nothing here may feed a routing or profile decision —
//! see [`subscription`]'s doc for why that is a rule and not a gap. "Visibility" includes whether
//! a Plex Pass feature is OFFERED at all (issue #266's audio enhancement, `route::enhancements_offered`):
//! the subscription decides that a toggle exists, and never which flavour or profile a stream gets.
//!
//! **PER SERVER, keyed the way the registry is.** This was one process-global answer, justified
//! by "host/port fix at the first install (a later install is only a token swap)" — a premise
//! [`super::servers`] retired: the table re-targets the current server, and a household can hold
//! its own server and a friend's share at once. A single global would mean the stats panel and
//! `player::error_shape` describing SERVER A's build and Plex Pass while the user is looking at
//! (or failing to play) something from server B — issue #22's bug with the polarity flipped, a
//! claim true of the development environment asserted as universal. So state is an array indexed
//! by [`ServerId::raw`], the registry's own slot number, and every accessor comes in two forms:
//! `_of(id)` for a caller that knows which server it is talking about, and the bare form for one
//! that means "the current server" (which is what every reader meant when there was only one).
//!
//! One fetch per registration: `servers::register` calls [`refresh`] for the server it just
//! registered — own or shared — so no caller has to remember to. The fetch is `GET /` on that
//! PMS — probed live against PMS 1.43.3 (2026-08-10): the root `MediaContainer` carries
//! `"myPlexSubscription": true|false` and `"version": "1.43.3.10861-…"`. Both ride the ordinary
//! typed client (`get_json`, JSON Accept + the `with_token` choke point), so nothing new touches
//! the transport and no token can appear here or in the log line.
