//! `discover.provider.plex.tv` — the plex.tv **metadata provider**, i.e. the biography half of a
//! person that the local PMS simply does not have.
//!
//! This is a THIRD service, beside the PMS `Client` (raw socket, local, `library.rs`) and the
//! plex.tv account API (`account.rs`). It shares the account API's transport and identity headers
//! exactly — same [`nj_net::net`] libcurl HTTPS (DNS + TLS, which the raw PMS socket has neither of),
//! same `X-Plex-*` header set — so it is written as an `impl AccountClient` block here rather than
//! as a fourth client type, the same way `library.rs`/`hubs.rs` add `impl Client` blocks to the PMS
//! client. Every call is **blocking**; run it on a worker thread.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** `GET /library/people/{id}` on the LOCAL server returns only the tag record
//! (`{id, filter, tag, tagType, tagKey, thumb}`) — no summary, no dates. That fact was right, and
//! for a while it was recorded as "Plex has no biography", which was wrong: the biography lives
//! here. Verified live 2026-07-29 against Idina Menzel and Peter Sallis.
//!
//! Three wire facts worth keeping, each of which cost a probe:
//! * **Only the `tagKey` guid addresses a person here.** The numeric `Tag::id` PMS also accepts for
//!   `/library/people/{id}/media` returns `404 {"message":"Invalid value provided for metadataId!"}`
//!   — the two id spaces are the local library's and plex.tv's, and only the guid crosses.
//! * **`Accept: application/json` is load-bearing.** Without it the provider answers **XML**
//!   (`content-type: application/xml`), exactly like PMS does — [`AccountClient`]'s header set
//!   already sends it, which is one more reason to ride that client rather than hand-roll one.
//! * **An unknown person is a 200, not a 404** — `totalSize:0` with no `Metadata`. That is an
//!   ANSWER ("plex.tv has never heard of them"), not a failure, and [`AccountClient::person_profile`]
//!   maps it to a DEFAULT profile so the caller settles instead of retrying forever.
//!
//! The token is optional here (the endpoint answered 200 unauthenticated in the same probe), but we
//! send whatever the session holds anyway — an unauthenticated read is not a promise plex.tv has
//! made, and `AccountClient` already carries the token when there is one.
//!
//! **The filmography, and why it took a SCREEN rather than a fetch.** `GET
//! {DISCOVER}/library/people/{tagKey}/credits` answers 200 with `CreditGroup[]` —
//! `[{type,title,Credit:[{order, role, Metadata{…}}]}]`, e.g. Peter Sallis's `actor`(222) /
//! `appeared`(21) / `other`(3). This module doc used to say it was deliberately unmodelled, and
//! the reason it gave is still the whole design constraint rather than an objection that has been
//! withdrawn: those `Metadata` rows are **Discover** items, so their `ratingKey` is a plex.tv guid
//! and their `thumb` an `image.tmdb.org` URL, and nothing in them opens a local detail page by
//! itself. What made it shippable is [`crate::ui::filmography`] — a screen that says which credits
//! you actually hold, by joining each row's `guid` against the `/media` answers the person page
//! already has, and presses through to a detail page on exactly those. A row with no server behind
//! it is a provider fact and draws no chevron.
//!
//! Two counts here are NOT interchangeable, and spending the wrong one is a promise the list cannot
//! keep. [`CreditType`] (on the PROFILE) says 1745 actor credits; this endpoint returns 222. The
//! tabs and the Filmography entry row spend the GROUP's own count — the number of rows that
//! actually exist to be scrolled — never the profile's.
//!
//! **The container key is `CreditGroup`, and the group's own shape is not what the name suggests.**
//! Measured 2026-09-06 against a real response: `MediaContainer.CreditGroup[]`, each group carrying
//! `title` ("Actor") + `type` ("actor") + `Credit[]` — and **no `size`**, so a group's count IS its
//! row count. Each `Credit` is `{order, role, Metadata}` where `Metadata` is ONE item, and that item
//! carries **no `guid`**: its `ratingKey` is the bare catalog ID that PMS spells
//! `plex://movie/<id>`. See [`CreditItem::rating_key`], which is the join key, and
//! [`CreditItem::thumb`], which is an absolute URL on another host.
//!
//! **And unlike the profile, this call REQUIRES a token** (measured 2026-09-05: no `X-Plex-Token`
//! → `401 {"error":"Unauthorized","message":"You must provide a token!"}`, where
//! `/library/people/{guid}` is recorded above as answering 200 unauthenticated). The token that
//! satisfies it is the plex.tv ACCOUNT token, which is what makes the filmography unreachable on
//! any automated boot: those sign in with `/tmp/nativejelly-token`, a *server* token, and leave
//! `Session::account_token` empty. That is the same wall `/tmp/nativejelly-personbio` exists for, one
//! step further along — the biography degrades to a blank line, the filmography degrades to
//! nothing at all — and it is why `/tmp/nativejelly-personcredits` had to be written.
