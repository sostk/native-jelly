//! **May a credential go to this origin — the ONE answer, and the plaintext grants behind it.**
//!
//! Every layer that puts a Plex token on a request asks [`credential_allowed`] (or, in a pure
//! function that receives the build's policy as a parameter, [`allowed_under`]): the registry
//! when it admits an origin, endpoint admission, the control-plane transport (`crate::http`), the
//! media plane (`crate::curlio`, `crate::stream_redirect`'s plaintext hops, the player's stream
//! start). Nothing else re-derives the rule, and nothing asks `Origin::is_tls` for a credential
//! decision on its own.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! A TLS origin may always carry a credential. A plaintext origin may when the BUILD allows it
//! ([`CredentialPolicy::AllowPlaintext`], developer builds only — [`CredentialPolicy::build`] is
//! still the only `cfg!` for this), or when a live [`PlaintextGrant`] names that exact origin. A
//! store build therefore sends a token over plaintext to exactly the origins the person consented
//! to, on the network and under the identity they consented on — and to nothing else.
//!
//! ## What a grant is bound to
//!
//! A grant is minted only by discovery ([`mint`]), from a FRESH verdict — plex.tv's resources and
//! a tokenless `/identity` answer — that [`InsecureEvidence::plaintext_eligibility`] calls
//! eligible, and only when the person's recorded consent for that (account, server) allows it.
//! Consent is the ACCOUNT's ([`account_key`]): an answer is honoured only while the plex.tv
//! account that gave it is the one signed in, so a different account signing in on the same
//! television is asked again.
//! It names:
//!
//! * the server's `machineIdentifier` — a grant admits THAT server's credential ([`allowed_for`]),
//!   never another machine's that happens to register at the same address;
//! * the exact plaintext origin — scheme, NUMERIC private host and port — that verified; a name is
//!   never granted, because a resolver could answer it with anything;
//! * the **identity generation** it was minted under ([`identity_changed`]: sign-out, a sign-in
//!   starting). A roster replacement — a profile switch's commit, a roster refresh — moves no
//!   generation; it keeps only the grants for the exact `(server, origin)` pairs the new roster
//!   installs ([`roster_replaced`]);
//! * the **network generation** it was minted under ([`network_changed`]: the app returning to the
//!   foreground, where nothing proves the television is still on the network it consented on).
//!   Every server that loses its grant there is queued for a fresh endpoint discovery, which
//!   re-proves the network and, the consent being persisted, mints again without asking.
//!
//! A grant whose generations are not the current ones is dead: it admits nothing, and the table
//! drops it. Nothing about a grant is persisted — a session file that names a plaintext origin
//! reactivates nothing by itself (`plex::session::SourceRef`); the next discovery re-proves
//! eligibility and mints a fresh one, or the origin stays tokenless.
//!
//! ## Revocation
//!
//! [`revoke`], a refusing [`answer`], [`identity_changed`], [`network_changed`] and
//! [`roster_replaced`] change the table at once, and the authority is asked when a request STARTS: every request that starts after
//! the change — queued, retried, a cached token-bearing URL, a media reopen — is refused at the
//! transport, and the registry re-grades every published client
//! ([`super::servers::regrade_credentials`]), blanking the token of any whose origin may no
//! longer carry one. A request already on the wire is not interrupted: it completes (or fails)
//! with the credential it started with, and nothing after it gets a new one. A refusal also moves
//! the consent generation, so a discovery that captured *Allowed* before it cannot mint the grant
//! back when it settles; and a refusal whose write has not reached the disk is written again
//! until it has ([`UpgradeRetry::due`]), so a restart never reads back the *Allowed* it replaced —
//! for as long as the account that refused is signed in: [`identity_changed`] drops it, and a
//! write never lands in a session file that belongs to another account.
//!
//! A grant also lives only as long as a FRESH verdict keeps reaching its server: discovery
//! withdraws it when the latest probe of that server did not reach the granted origin
//! (`auth::publish_settled_probe`), and retires it when HTTPS verifies
//! (`auth::retire_grant_on_https`). Nothing here watches the network itself — the platform
//! offers this app no network-change signal it subscribes to — so the foreground return is the
//! one continuity break treated as a new network.
//!
//! ## Offers
//!
//! The table also holds what may be ASKED: a fresh eligible insecure-only verdict under the
//! current generations ([`offered`]). The consent surfaces — the sign-in read-out, Home's and the
//! Library's failure read-out, Settings' *Unencrypted connections* — read [`offers`]; an offer is
//! never a grant, and dies with the generations exactly as a grant does.
