//! **Which libraries feed Home — the rules, pure.**
//!
//! The store is [`browse`](crate::browse)'s section table (in memory, indexed by the app) and
//! [`Session::home_pins`](super::session::Session::home_pins) (on disk, keyed by profile). This
//! module is neither: it is the policy between them, kept free of both so every rule below is
//! graded by `cargo test --lib` rather than observed on a television.
//!
//! `browse.rs` referred to a `pin::resolve` for a week before one existed — the comment describing
//! this file was written when the pin default was hard-wired to `true` because deliverable F (the
//! first-run route) had nowhere to ask the question. It has one now, and these are its rules:
//!
//! * **Your HOUSEHOLD's libraries arrive On, a friend's arrive Off.** The point of asking is not
//!   to put a stranger's shelves on your front door unannounced (`Shared Sources.dc.html` §F).
//!   The household and not the account, because plex.tv answers a Plex Home managed profile with
//!   `owned:false` on the family's own server — so a rule written on raw ownership gave the
//!   household's own shelves a stranger's defaults for every profile but the admin's. The verdict
//!   is [`crate::catalog::is_household`]'s and arrives here as a bool; see [`LibRef::household`].
//! * **An account with no server of its OWN HOUSEHOLD is not a special case.** Every source it has
//!   is borrowed, so "a friend's arrives Off" would open the app on nothing at all; with nothing of
//!   the household's to prefer, a borrowed library is simply a library.
//! * **A recorded answer beats the default**, in both directions — which is why
//!   [`HomePins`](super::session::HomePins) records the Offs too. A library nobody was asked about
//!   (a share that answered late, one the owner created since) lands on its default instead of
//!   silently Off, and that is what makes "a share arriving later does not reopen this screen"
//!   honest rather than merely quiet.
//! * **Only an answer somebody GAVE is written down.** [`record`] takes one `Option` per library
//!   and skips the `None`s, so a default nobody chose keeps re-deriving instead of being frozen as
//!   if it were a decision — see [`answers`], which is the rule for which is which. Which rows
//!   those are is REPORTED by the editor that holds the draft (`BrowseCmd::ApplyPins`), never
//!   inferred from the values: an answer is still an answer when the default it was given against
//!   has since moved onto the same value.
//! * **Home is never empty.** The one state the control genuinely has no answer for, and the reason
//!   the Home editor's draft refuses to unpin the last library (`screens::onboard`'s
//!   `OnboardScreen::toggle_row`; the
//!   test-only `browse::toggle_pin` keeps the same floor). The same floor is applied here,
//!   because a *recorded* selection can be emptied without any toggle at all: unpin your own
//!   libraries in favour of a friend's, then lose the friend from the roster.
