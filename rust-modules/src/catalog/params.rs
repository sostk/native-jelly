/// **A ceiling is answered by choosing the FLAVOR, and only then by asking for a number.** The

/// here" until 2026-08-23, and the sentence was right about a LINK ceiling and wrong as a general
/// rule, because a link is not the only thing that can impose one. A **user-chosen** ceiling
/// (`route::Quality` — the picker behind the player's `…` menu, for LG checklist #43 CASE1) is a
/// different input with the identical mechanism: `route::quality_policy` returns the same
