//! browse — the Library screen's per-section paged catalog.
//!
//! Production ownership is in `stores::browse::BrowseStore`, one instance per app Bridge. This
//! module supplies the core state transitions and immutable publication types; every stateful
//! operation requires an explicit `BrowseState` or `BrowseStore` receiver.
//!
//! Sibling of `pms.rs`'s hub catalog, which stays hub-only (256-cap, rebuilt wholesale by
//! `pms`'s worker-driven hub catalog); this store pages arbitrarily large sections without blocking the
//! main loop. Data model: one [`SecItems`] per section — a PAGE-CHUNKED table sized to the
//! listing's `totalSize`, a page (`PAGE` items) allocated only when it lands (restructure phase
//! 4's O(result) rule) — filled page-by-page by ONE background fetch at a
//! time using the season-switch idiom from `metadata.rs` — [`nj_base::task::spawn_small`] + a
//! `Mutex` mailbox + generation atomics (a re-query supersedes in-flight landings), applied
//! on the main thread by [`pump`] once a frame while the Library screen is up.
//!
//! The sort/filter MENUS are server-driven: the first page of a section is requested with
//! `includeMeta=1` and the response's `Meta.Type[]` supplies the Sort entries; the genre
//! value list is fetched lazily (`kick_genres`) when the filter menu first opens. Nothing
//! menu-shaped is hardcoded, with one measured exception: PMS 1.43.4 never advertises a
//! play-count sort in `Meta.Type[].Sort` on any section type, yet it DOES honour
//! `sort=viewCount:desc`/`:asc` on movie and show sections (an unrecognised key 500s the whole
//! listing, so this is not something to guess at for a section type that hasn't been proven).
//! [`with_plays_sort`] appends that one client-side entry where [`SecKind`] proves it works,
//! and only once, in case a future server starts advertising the key itself (issue #146).
//!
//! The CHOSEN sort of a library's own listing is remembered across restarts, per profile, by
//! (machine id, section key) and by the sort's KEY, never its menu position
//! (`plex::session::Session::library_sorts`, issue #278). It is applied on the section's first
//! page only after that page's menu has offered the key again — the discovery request never
//! carries it, for the 500 above — and the unsorted discovery page is then never published
//! ([`fetch_listing_page`]). A key the menu no longer offers falls back silently to the default.
//!
//! [`BrowseState`] is main-thread-only; worker threads touch only their owning store adapter's
//! mailboxes + atomics and the `&'static` Plex client.
//!
//! ## The table addresses (SOURCE, section), not a section
//!
//! A section key is only unique within one server: measured 2026-08-11 against a real share, our
//! own server's section `1` and the friend's section `1` are different libraries, and each server
//! answers 401 to the other's token. So the table is a flat `Vec<BrowseSection>` whose every entry
//! names its [`BrowseSource`], and every fetch is issued through `client_for(source.sid)` captured
//! AT THE SPAWN SITE — never `client()` read inside a worker, which would dial whichever server
//! happened to be current when the thread got scheduled.
//!
//! **It grows by APPEND and never by rebuild**, which is what keeps the page mailbox sound. A page
//! landing is blamed on a section INDEX (`PageResult.sec`), so an index that moved under an
//! in-flight fetch would splice one library's items into another's store. The old
//! the old synchronous discovery's early-return was the only thing preventing that; appending is the property
//! that replaces it, and it holds for every source that lands later rather than only for the
//! second call.

    // only their library, because `ensure_sections` discovers the CURRENT server and the strip had
    // just been re-pointed at theirs.

// The consequence is the property B was written for: the strip is a constant width at one friend
// or at ten. Put source in the strip instead and three friends measure 2133px against a 1540 track.
// Source rides inside the library pill's own label instead, so adding people never reshapes this strip.
//
// **What DOES reshape it is the favourite switch, and that is the change of 2026-09-05.** Movies
// and TV Shows were permanent destinations — `tab_count` was a constant 2 and `tabs_gen` a
// constant 1 — because the switch governed Home alone. It governs the whole app now, so a type
// whose last favourite library is switched off draws no pill: keeping the pill and drawing an
// empty screen behind it is the "tab that leads to nothing" the design rejects, arrived at from
// the other direction, and the switch is the user's own instruction not to be shown that content.
//
// The cost is that a strip POSITION is no longer a stable name for a destination. That is why
// `ui::widgets::Pill::Section` carries a `SecKind` and not a tab index, and why anything holding a
// strip cursor across frames must hold a `Pill` rather than a `usize`.

/// Every type this product has a pill for, in strip order. A pill is only DRAWN when the
/// favourite set can fill it — see [`tab_kinds`] — so this is the vocabulary, not the strip.

// an older build then silently applies defaults).
//
// **It governed Home ALONE until 2026-09-05 and this header said so.** Owner's direction: the
// setting affects the whole app. Three browsing surfaces read it now — Home's shelves
// (`pms::item_pinned`), the top tab STRIP (`tab_has_favorite`: a type with no favourite draws no
// pill at all) and the Library's own Sources picker (`source_rows`). `all_source_rows` stays
// unscoped and is the Favorite libraries editor's list, which is the one way a non-favourite comes
// back. Search deliberately stays GRANT-scoped and only RANKS by this: a browsing preference is not
// an authorization boundary, and removing results would turn "I don't browse this often" into
// "this does not exist".

// The rules are `plex::pins` — pure, host-graded, and deliberately holding no store. This half is
// the plumbing: project the section table into what those rules take, apply what they answer, and
// persist an answer against the profile that gave it.
//
// **Per profile is the whole shape.** The persisted selection used to hang off the `Session`,
// which is one per INSTALL, so a household could hold exactly one opinion about a friend's films.
// Owner's ruling, 2026-08-21: "it is separate for each profile." A switch needs no code of its own
// to honour it — `install_pms` calls [`reset`], discovery re-runs, and [`resolve_pins`] reads the
// NEW profile's record — which is exactly why the resolve is a whole-table function rather than a
// per-row default applied once at append.

/// **The current profile's persisted answer, as last read from disk** — the half of the selection
/// the section table cannot express.
///
/// The table only ever holds sources that have answered, while Home/Library/Search/Onboard
/// enumerate the granted roster asynchronously. During that window a share can have no row here;
/// `pms::feeds_home` must still recover its recorded answer by machine identity.
/// Their answer is on disk keyed by machine, which is exactly the join that settles it.
///
/// `None` means "nothing has been read yet", never "nothing was recorded" — the same distinction
/// [`library_pins`] and `Session::home_pins` both turn on. Written by [`resolve_pins`] and
/// [`record_pins`], cleared by [`reset`]; never read from the file per frame.
