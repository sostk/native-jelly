//! **One library's own shelves** — the `Library Recommended` rows its server's owner arranged,
//! quoted rather than composed.
//!
//! `GET /hubs/sections/{id}` ([`crate::catalog::Client::library_hubs`], verified live 2026-09-05;
//! `docs/pms-api.md` §3a is the record and five of its findings contradict the OpenAPI spec). The
//! Library screen draws these above its A–Z grid, in one continuous scroll.
//!
//! ## Why this is a FIELD on `SecState` and not a store of its own
//!
//! The obvious shape was a sibling of [`crate::catalog_fetch`] keyed by `(ServerId, section_key)` with its
//! own LRU. [`super::SecState`] is *already* the per-library-section aggregate — it owns that
//! section's query, verdict, items, focus and scroll — so a second store meant a second section
//! identity, a second generation gate, a second mailbox and a second retry policy for one library,
//! plus a cache that would **survive a Plex Home profile switch** and show the next profile the
//! previous one's resume and watched state. [`super::reset`] already solves that, and `EPOCH`
//! already gates landings. One identity, not two that must agree.
//!
//! ## The publication machine, and why it is not just "commit when terminal"
//!
//! The grid and the hubs land independently, and **the shelf count sets the grid's absolute
//! offset** — a late 12-shelf landing would move a focused grid row by 6,588px. "Commit when the
//! fetch is terminal" does not work, because [`crate::catalog_fetch::backoff_secs`] is an INFINITE ladder
//! (2/4/8/16/30s and then 30s forever): terminal never arrives on a dead server, and an ordinary
//! fail-then-succeed would still shift the grid under a reader.
//!
//! So there are **two independent axes**, which is the thing to hold on to here. A *publication*
//! state ([`Publication`]) and a *fetch* state (idle / in flight / backing off) running underneath
//! it: zero shelves can be `Committed` while the ladder is still retrying, and a refresh can be in
//! flight over a `Committed` or `Staged` set.
//!
//! | [`Publication`] | Meaning | Effect on layout |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Fetching` | nothing published yet; the first attempt is out, inside a bounded first-paint window | not committed; the grid draws where it already is |
//! | `Staged` | a landing exists but publishing it would move a grid the user is looking at | held; nothing moves |
//! | `Committed` | the shelf set the current layout was built from | the document |
//!
//! The **first-paint window is a separate policy from the retry ladder** — when it expires the
//! section commits ZERO shelves and the page is usable, while the ladder keeps retrying underneath
//! and any later success arrives as `Staged`. A newer success replaces an older staged set; a
//! FAILURE preserves both the staged success and the last committed set, because a transient
//! failure must never be able to subtract shelves.
//!
//! That last rule is not an edge case here, it is the ORDINARY refresh path: §3a measured two of
//! these hubs changing identity between requests — the genre and actor/director shelves rotate
//! their subject on every call and sometimes answer empty — so a plain refetch legitimately returns
//! a different shelf count and different ids with nothing changed on the server.
//!
//! ## Who drives it
//!
//! [`kick`] is the only thing that issues a request. The owned Library emits `PublishShelves`;
//! the application combines its visibility flags with live press state and delivers addressed
//! `LibraryWork::Hubs` to `stores::browse`, which calls `kick` and gates staged publication.
//! It was dormant for one landing — deliberately, since a fetch is
//! production network, task and retry behaviour and "fetched but not drawn" would not have been
//! dormancy at all — and the screen that draws the shelves is what woke it.
