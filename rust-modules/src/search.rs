//! search — the search screen's data layer (the store the owned `screens::search::SearchScreen` draws).
//!
//! One query, fanned out across every registered source, merged into typed shelves and pumped once
//! a frame while the screen is up. The types down to [`shelves`] are what `screens::search::render`
//! draws;
//! everything below the *fetch plumbing* banner is the machine that fills them. [`terms`] is the
//! one predicate the screen shares with the store — see its doc before writing a second one.
//!
//! ## The endpoint, and what it actually returns
//!
//! `GET /hubs/search?query=…&limit=…` ([`crate::catalog::Client::search`], written long before this
//! screen and dead until now). The spec says it "is intended to be very fast, and called as the
//! user types", which is the design this store is built for. Three things were measured against
//! PMS 1.43.3 rather than taken from the spec, each of which decides something here:
//!
//! - **A one-character query returns every hub empty.** So [`MIN_QUERY`] is 2, and the first
//!   keystroke of every search costs no round trip at all.
//! - **Hub ORDER moves per query** — `sta` ranks people first, `star` ranks films first. So the
//!   shelf order here is FIXED ([`KINDS`]) and ranking is honoured only *inside* a shelf.
//!   Reordering shelves per keystroke would move the row under the user's focus while they type.
//! - **Items arrive in two different containers** — see [`crate::catalog::Hub::directory`]. That is
//!   why [`Item`] is an enum instead of one struct. Collections are asked for with
//!   `includeCollections=1`, which makes them full `Metadata[]` rows ([`Item::Collection`]) rather
//!   than tag rows; a server that ignores the flag still sends tags, which [`project`] turns into
//!   the same [`Item::Collection`] once folded.
//!
//! ## Multi-source
//!
//! Search is single-server: `/hubs/search` answers for the machine you asked, and
//! `docs/shared-servers.md` states that nothing aggregates server-side — the merge is the client's
//! job. So this fans out one query per [`crate::catalog::server_ids`] and merges into the shelves
//! below, which is why every [`Item`] carries its own `ServerId`.
//!
//! The merge is **round robin** ([`merge`]), not source-by-source the way Home groups its shelves.
//! Home groups because a shelf there BELONGS to a source and adjacency is what says so; a search
//! shelf is genuinely mixed (the deleted legacy `ui/search/results.rs`'s own reasoning, carried
//! onto the owned `screens::search::mod.rs`'s `OWNER_FLOOR`: the owner annotation follows FOCUS,
//! not a fixed shelf owner), so concatenating would bury a friend's best match behind
//! twenty-three worse ones of ours. There is no cross-server relevance score to sort on — the only
//! ranking any server hands over is the order of its own list — so taking one from each in turn is
//! the most each server's ranking can be honoured at once.
//!
//! A source that fails contributes nothing and **fails nobody else**: each has its own in-flight
//! claim, its own retry backoff and its own mailbox, and [`State`] is `Failed` only when every one
//! of them is.
//!
//! ## Favourites RANK here; they never filter
//!
//! The **Favorite libraries** switch governs every other browsing surface — Home's shelves, which
//! type pills the top strip draws, the Library's Sources picker — and this screen is the deliberate
//! exception. It stays **grant-scoped**: every library the account may reach is searched, and the
//! favourites only decide the ORDER ([`merge`], favourites first, each pass stable so the server's
//! own ranking survives inside it).
//!
//! The reason is that a favourite is a browsing preference, not an authorization boundary. Removing
//! a non-favourite library's hits turns "I don't browse this often" into "this does not exist": a
//! user searching by name for a film they own and can play gets nothing, with no explanation on
//! screen and no control anywhere that obviously undoes it. Plex's own Favorite Libraries feature
//! makes the same split.
//!
//! **Counts stay grant-wide**, and that is a second decision rather than a consequence: "12 films"
//! must keep meaning every film the user can play, or the count becomes a quieter version of the
//! same false negative. Two edges make it harder than it sounds and both are pinned by tests — the
//! visible cap must not truncate the FOLD (the cap bounds what is DRAWN, not what is COUNTED), and
//! a tag straddling a favourite and a non-favourite library ranks favourite with its whole count.
//!
//! The favourite table is a SNAPSHOT taken at the spawn site and watched by a second generation
//! ([`SearchState::fav_gen`]) beside the roster's — see that field for why a change re-arms the
//! query rather than re-sorting what is on screen.
//!
//! ## The idiom to copy
//!
//! `person.rs`, not `browse.rs`: generation + a **monotone** mailbox write + [`supersede`] + a
//! per-fetch in-flight flag and retry backoff, pumped once a frame. As-you-type guarantees
//! overlapping workers, and a monotone mailbox is what stops a slow answer for `wal` repopulating
//! the results for `wallace`. Debounce is `ui/detail.rs`'s `season_settle` accumulator. Two rules
//! that are easy to miss and both wedge the screen forever if missed: release the in-flight flag
//! when `spawn_small` REFUSES, and call [`nj_machine::idle::invalidate`] on every landing including
//! the failure branch.
//!
//! ## Ownership (`docs/stores-as-machines.md`)
//!
//! [`SearchState`] is the main-thread-only logical state (query, shelves, generation fences, per
//! source status/backoff/answer); [`SearchAdapter`] is the `Arc`'d worker-touched half (one
//! [`Fetch`] per registry slot — the in-flight claim plus the landing mailbox). A production
//! `Bridge` owns exactly one of each pair through `stores::search::SearchStore`, which is what
//! makes two `Bridge`s share neither a query, a landing nor a notice.
//! `SearchStore::run_with_directory` rotates `adapter` to a fresh `Arc` on `SearchCmd::Reset`, so
//! a worker spawned before the reset can only ever complete into the retired mailbox it captured.
