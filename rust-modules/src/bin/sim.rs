//! `nativejelly-sim` — the desktop UI simulator.
//!
//! The same application core the television runs, linked against a desktop SDL2 and desktop GL
//! instead of LG's. It draws the real interface, against a real Plex Media Server, on a laptop.
//!
//! **What it is for.** The television serializes the entire dev loop: one set, one app instance,
//! and two `tests/run.py` jobs kill each other's app. That makes every UI change a queue. Several
//! simulators can run at once — each with its own instance root (`NJ_RUNTIME_DIR`), so each
//! has its own trigger namespace, its own remote FIFO and its own event log — which is what lets
//! independent UI and data-layer work proceed in parallel.
//!
//! **What it is NOT.** There is no video. The 29-symbol media seam does not exist off-device, and
//! `player::ffi_host`'s `HostSink` reports the same "no video path" failure a television with no
//! usable ACB binding reports, so Play lands on the app's real failure read-out. Nor is it a substitute
//! for the device on anything the GPU decides: the `--fps` gates are calibrated to the SM9000's
//! Mali, and text rasterization here goes through a different FreeType. A green run on this binary
//! is evidence about a Mac. Layout, focus, navigation, and every byte of the Plex data layer are
//! the parts that do transfer — and they are most of the UI work.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   nativejelly-sim [pms-host] [pms-port]
//! Environment:
//!   NJ_PMS_HOST / NJ_PMS_PORT   server to talk to (argv wins)
//!   NJ_RUNTIME_DIR                     this instance's trigger/FIFO/log root
//!   NJ_APP_DIR                         where appfont*.ttf and the icons live (repo `pkg/`)
