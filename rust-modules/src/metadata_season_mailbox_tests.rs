//! The season mailbox: landing races and cross-server guards on the season fetch pipeline.

/// The whole season mailbox in one serial test — same shape and same reason as the detail one
/// above: the statics are global, so splitting this into parallel `#[test]`s would have them
/// racing each other rather than the code.
///
/// The FIRST block is the audit finding: `fetch_episodes` returned an empty Vec for BOTH "this
/// season has no episodes" and "the `/children` GET failed", and `pump_season` installed it
/// either way — so one transient PMS failure blanked a populated episode row, with no spinner
/// and no error, onto a tab that could then never be asked again. The blocks after it cover the
/// supersede / monotone / wrong-item guards this change rewrites; on their own they would pass
/// before and after, which is why they live inside the failing test rather than beside it.
