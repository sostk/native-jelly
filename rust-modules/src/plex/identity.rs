//! Who this client says it is — ONE set of constants for both Plex services.
//!
//! There are two independent transports here and they used to each hardcode their own identity:
//! [`account`](super::account) talks to plex.tv over libcurl and sends `X-Plex-*` as HEADERS, while
//! [`client`](super::client) talks to the PMS and sends them as QUERY PARAMETERS. Nothing kept the
//! two in step, and they had drifted on every field that mattered:
//!
//! | field       | plex.tv said        | the PMS said     |
//! |-------------|---------------------|------------------|
//! | Product     | `Plex for webOS`    | `PlxNative`      |
//! | Version     | `1.0`               | `0.1.0`          |
//! | Device      | `LG TV`             | `webOS`          |
//! | Device-Name | `Plex (LG webOS)`   | `Living Room TV` |
//! | Model       | `LG webOS TV`       | `49SM9000PLA`    |
//!
//! Two of those were release blockers rather than untidiness.
//!
//! **`Plex for webOS` is impersonation.** `Plex for <platform>` is Plex's own documented
//! first-party naming pattern (their sample value is `Plex for Roku`), and it appeared verbatim in
//! the authorized-devices list of the account this app signs into — on a platform where an official
//! Plex app exists. A server owner had no way to tell an unofficial client from Plex's own. This is
//! an unofficial client and must say so; that is also what makes the referential use of the Plex
//! name elsewhere defensible.
//!
//! **`49SM9000PLA` is the author's television.** It was accurate for exactly one device on earth
//! and reported as fact by every install.
//!
//! `Living Room TV` was the third: not an impersonation, but a claim about a room this app cannot
//! see, and identical across every install, so two users of the same shared server appeared under
//! one name.
//!
//! The client IDENTIFIER is deliberately not here — it is per-install, not per-build. It is minted
//! once from `/dev/urandom` and persisted by [`session`](super::session).
