//! **The focus fingerprint** — one line naming everything `app.rs`'s key ladder can move, written
//! to the event log only on the frames where it CHANGES.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The once/sec heartbeat (`app.rs`, the `loop=` line) publishes `route=`, `overlay=` and `pos=`.
//! Most of the key ladder's arms move focus *within* a screen without touching any of those three:
//! UP on the home grid, LEFT along the detail hero's action row, DOWN through an open popover. A
//! (route × key) characterization harness built on the heartbeat alone would therefore pin the
//! handful of arms that change route and be blind to the rest.
//!
//! This module is the missing instrument. It samples the read-only accessors each screen already
//! exposes, formats them into one ordered line, and logs that line when — and only when — it
//! differs from the last one. What a key press did is then the diff between the fingerprint before
//! it and the fingerprint after.
//!
//! # Rules this module keeps
//!
//! **Read-only.** Every field comes from a getter the screen already exposes for the app's own
//! use. This module adds no accessor to any screen and edits none, and it drains no one-shot
//! mailbox — `detail::take_open_request`, `detail::take_alt_open` and `person::take_request` are
//! deliberately untouched, because reading one would consume a navigation.
//!
//! **It must not touch [`nj_machine::idle`].** It never calls `invalidate()`. Reporting to the frame
//! gate would hold every screen presenting forever, which would destroy the very idle behaviour a
//! harness built on this is meant to be able to observe.
//!
//! **Redaction.** The event log is pasted into public issue threads (`app/diagnostics.rs`'s module doc has
//! the reasoning, and `dev.rs`'s `DevServer::describe` has the incident). So the line carries
//! indices, enum tags, booleans, and — as the only identity — rating keys and the registry SLOT
//! number of a server. No title, no path, no URL, no server name, address or `machineIdentifier`,
//! no token. The enforcement is structural rather than a matter of care: every value written here
//! is either a number, a bool, a `&'static str` tag chosen in this file, or a rating key that goes
//! through [`push_rk`], which copies ASCII alphanumerics and nothing else.
//!
//! **Diffable.** Fixed field order, one line, no timestamps, no addresses, and no float is ever
//! printed — the two spring positions that decide a branch (Home's grid-dive snap, and the target beside
//! it) are reduced to the booleans the code itself compares them as. A field's PRESENCE is a
//! function of [`Screen`] alone, so two lines for the same screen always carry the same keys.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! [`armed`] resolves its trigger once and answers from a `OnceLock` afterwards, so an unarmed
//! build or an unarmed boot pays one atomic load and a branch per frame. Armed, a frame pays the
//! accessor reads for the CURRENT screen only — the `match` on [`Screen`] never reaches another
//! screen's getters — plus one `String` build of 40–160 bytes.
//!
//! Measured on the dev Mac at `opt-level = 2` (2026-08-15, 50k builds per screen, host accessors
//! over empty stores): **39–223 ns** per frame on every screen except the player, where the line
//! costs **~7.3 µs**. That one number is worth knowing before adding a field: **~6.4 µs of it is a
//! single filesystem `stat`**, inside [`crate::appkit::player_hud::transport_hidden`] →
//! `player_hud::busy` → `devtrig::flag("failtest")`. The rest of the player's seventeen fields together
//! cost ~0.9 µs. It is paid deliberately: `transport_hidden` is the exact predicate
//! `PlayerScreen::handle_key` tests before any transport arm, and the alternative is a second
//! derivation of a rule that module keeps in one place. The player route is also the one route the idle gate excludes, so it draws
//! at full rate and 7 µs is ~0.04% of a 16.7 ms frame.
//!
//! # Arming it
//!
//! `touch /tmp/nativejelly-focus` on the television (or in `NJ_RUNTIME_DIR` under the
//! simulator), then read `focus ` lines out of `/tmp/nativejelly-events.log`. The trigger is listed
//! in [`crate::dev`]'s `DIAG` set, so arming the observer does not also change which screen the app
//! boots to — the same reasoning `nativejelly-noidle` carries, and it matters more here: a harness
//! that wants to characterize the who's-watching picker must not lose the picker by watching it.
//! `RELEASE=1` drops the `devtriggers` feature, `devtrig::flag` becomes `false`, and this whole surface
//! goes quiet.
