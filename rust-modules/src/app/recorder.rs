//! Controlled recording/replay over the production boot and frame loop (§5.3–5.5).
//!
//! `bootstrap::Initial` captures Session authority/entropy, consent, automation and pre-work
//! Home, Settings and synthetic content inputs. Replay validates the recording before native boot,
//! restores those inputs,
//! binds its primary Client explicitly, and supplies Home/Browse arrivals through Bridge's
//! ordinary dispatcher. Replay request executors do not launch data workers; the bound Client
//! also denies/counts transport attempts. Detail and Person replies are supplied at their
//! original store consumers; admissions retain the request identity and spawn answer.
//! Account and playback remain outside this contract.
//! Startup WILL/DID foreground is a bounded logical input. Replay resumes navigation without
//! native playback or network-grant authority; actual SDL still owns physical window safety.
//! Background lifecycle remains outside the accepted recording domain.
//! Page-capture GPU readiness is recorded before dispatch and supplied on replay. It drives the
//! ordinary motion/presentation gates; the final present decision is still computed and graded.
//! Physical window authority remains live and cannot be supplied by the recording.
//! Controlled Person requests keep captured authority; asynchronous ambient session-cache
//! recovery cannot retire or reissue them at an unrecorded frame.
//!
//! Supported effects carry complete private payloads, including screen-input time/source/edge
//! and focus identity. Missing/extra/changed effects or results prevent SAME. A codec error
//! invalidates the Writer and replay acceptance; equal unsupported markers are never matches.
//! Recorded keys and supplied keys use the same production controlled ingress, retaining the
//! original event timestamp and source rather than synthesizing a new SDL timestamp.
//!
//! AppFrameV4 combines press/route/overlay/focus/tree with cached Session, physical Consent and typed initial-input
//! digests. Private initial/effect data may contain credentials; shareable probes contain no
//! raw identity. Only explicit synthetic construction is eligible for fixture import.
//!
//! **Historical landing gate (phase 11, §3.3 step 3).** Before controlled initialization, the
//! stores fetched live during replay and the gate constrained when answers were observed.
//! Every landing SITE — Home's hubs through `bridge::take_hubs_results`, and
//! each legacy pump's mailbox take (`metadata` detail/season/alt-sources, `person`, `viewstate`,
//! `browse`'s four, `search`'s per-source slot) — consumes its mailbox through `nj_machine::landgate`,
//! which during a replay holds an EARLY arrival until the frame the recording consumed it on. A
//! LATE arrival is delivered at once and counted, exactly as before: holding cannot manufacture a
//! result that has not come. An arrival the recording never saw is `extra`; a recorded landing
//! this run never produced is `missing`, reported when the replay ends. All three ride the
//! verdict as `land_diffs`.
//!
//! Three things about the shape are deliberate, and each was a wrong turn first.
//! **(1) The gate wraps the TAKE, never the pump.** A pump both lands and spawns, so gating the
//! pump would have suppressed the request whose landing it was waiting for — turning every browse
//! and search landing into a guaranteed late one.
//! **(2) The schedule is per STORE and per FRAME, deduplicated on both sides** — one `land`
//! record per (frame, store), one cursor step per (frame, store) — so a store with five landing
//! sites needs no site identity of its own and the recording stays one line per frame per store.
//! **(3) It is a SCHEMA change** (`ui::rec::SCHEMA` 1 → 2): a schema-1 recording carries no `land`
//! records at all, so replaying one under the gate would grade nothing while looking as though it
//! graded everything. It is refused instead, and `tools/nativejelly-rec rerecord` is the verb.
//!
//! Measured on flow 12 (2026-09-10, three runs of three): the recording's single `async` record
//! sat on frame 1, every replay observed it on frame 0, and because a spring started one frame
//! earlier never re-converges bit for bit, 927 of 928 frames diverged.
//!
//! Arming is at boot only (`Writer::open` refuses any other frame). The directory is the runtime
//! root's `nativejelly-recordings/latest` (not `nativejelly-rec/`, which is the trigger FILE's own
//! name) — private, gitignored, refused by the outbound guard; a
//! committed fixture uses the full synthetic initializer and `tests/mock_pms.py`, then passes
//! `tools/nativejelly-rec`'s closed alphabet and the actual replay gate. This is not all-domain or
//! cross-target AppInit acceptance.

/// `PlayerOverlay{…}`, and the player itself now contributes state at all — its HUD timer, cursor
/// and scrub gesture were `static mut`s and `TX` atomics that no `LogicalState` could see, so a

/// contributes `screens::alt_sources::SHAPE` and `ARG_SHAPE` gains its `AltSources` variant; the
/// page's own `screens::detail::SHAPE` narrows its `panel:u8` at the same time, because which panel
/// is up is the CONTAINER's record now (`Navigation::write` writes every surface's argument, phase
/// and instance hash) and a second copy on the page would be two producers of one fact. The
/// *Track information* sheet is the second bump: `screens::tracks_panel::SHAPE` joins the

        // rerecorded, because a recording taken before this hashed the picker's cursor nowhere at
        // all — its UP/DOWN moved a `static mut TABLE` no `LogicalState` could see.
        // Phase 10, the Detail page's *Track information* sheet: `ARG_SHAPE` gains
        // `TracksPanel{page:i32}` and `TracksPanelScreen` joins the inventory. The same transition
        // for the same reason — a fixture recorded against 0xb4a9_96a9_e8f6_0b37 hashed that
        // sheet's PAGE nowhere, and paging it moves nothing else in the app, so a replay of one
        // graded the sheet appearing and disappearing with a hole between.
        // Phase 10: the PROFILE MENU is an owned surface. `ARG_SHAPE` loses
        // `Account{over:BarHost{…}}` (the route it rode on is deleted) and gains `AccountMenu`,
        // and the menu's own state — its header, its row set and its cursor — joins the inventory
        // for the first time (`screens::account_menu::SHAPE`). Another schema transition rather
        // than a rebaseline: the rows and the selection were `static mut ROWS`/`TABLE`, which no
        // `LogicalState` could see, so a recording taken before this came back `SAME` for a replay
        // that landed on a DIFFERENT row of the menu.
        // Phase 10 again: the ITEM CONTEXT MENU is an owned surface too. `ARG_SHAPE` loses
        // `ItemMenu{over:MenuHost{…}}` and gains `ItemMenu{sid,rk,kind,host,focus,anchor,…}` —
        // which is the six `static mut`s the popover carried, promoted to the entry's argument —
        // and the panel's own rows, actions and cursor join the inventory
        // (`screens::item_menu::SHAPE`). `PlayerScreen` also SHRINKS in the same commit: its
        // `held: HeldKey` had had no producer since phase 9 and went with the loop's client-side
        // repeat timer, so `player::SHAPE` loses `held:{sym,down_sym}`. A schema transition on all
        // three counts, so the recordings are refused and rerecorded rather than rebaselined.
        // **The MERGE of those two lanes is itself a third shape, and neither lane's own pin
        // describes it.** The page-panel lane pinned 0xcbf9_7184_91da_329c over an `ARG_SHAPE`
        // that still carried `Account{over:BarHost{…}}`/`ItemMenu{over:MenuHost{…}}` in its
        // `Route` alphabet; the shared-modal lane pinned 0x732f_34cd_7c07_6197 over one with no
        // `AltSources`/`TracksPanel` in it. The union has all four surfaces, one `Route` alphabet
        // with neither menu in it, and canon tags 6/7 for the two Detail panels against 8/9 for
        // the two menus — so BOTH of those values must be refused here, exactly as the values
        // before them are.
        //
        // **Phase 10, lane A: the pin SPLITS, and this half stops moving when a screen lands.**
        // `state_fp()` is [`APP_SHAPES`] folded in front of `screens::registry::SCREEN_SHAPES`,
        // and the screen half carries its own pin in that module
        // (`the_screen_shape_inventory_is_pinned`) — because the criterion this phase proves is
        // that a new screen touches the registry and not this file. What is asserted here is the
        // LOOP's own list. The values above are the history of the COMBINED one and are kept: every
        // recording ever refused was refused against one of them, and `state_fp()` still reports a
        // combined value (0x6a5c_ca67_6290_b770 at the moment of the split, unchanged by it —
        // the move preserved both the order and the strings).
        // AppFrameV2 adds Session's cached digest. AppFrameV4 adds the physical Consent owner;
        // both predecessor censuses remain pinned separately below, and recordings on either
        // combined shape are explicitly refused.
        //
        // **Household evidence moves it to 0x6c07_e505_2de6_63b8.** `ControlledHomeInitV2{…
