//! The frame loop — phase 1b-ii's THIN COORDINATOR (restructure spec §13).
//!
//! `run` is the one `while app.running` loop; each phase of an iteration is a function below,
//! cut VERBATIM out of `nj_run`'s former body at the eight `FRAMEDROP` stamps (spec §8.4) so
//! that a diff of this commit is moves and renames only — `app.<field>` for what used to be a
//! loop-local, `fr.<field>` ([`Frame`]) for the handful of per-iteration values that cross a
//! phase boundary. Nothing is reordered;
//! the positional frame points the restructure names (NAV COMMIT, `opaque_route`, the present
//! decision, `clear_opaque_region` inside [`draw`], the swap) are the labelled lines of `run`
//! itself, which is why they are not folded into a phase function.
//!
//! Phase 2 replaces this loop with `ui::dispatch`'s ten-step algorithm (spec §3.3); the phase
//! names here are that algorithm's, mapped onto today's order (`navcommit` still runs BEFORE
//! `tick_drain` on this loop, and the `FRAMEDROP` line prints them in the spec's order).
//!
//! **Phase 5b is where the replacement stopped being a shadow.** The Settings family — the root,
//! Legal and its documents, Privacy & data, the first-run consent question and Favourite libraries
//! in both its modes — is now OWNED by the dispatcher, and this loop asks it four questions and
//! obeys one queue:
//!
//! * `Dispatcher::owns_input` — asked by the key, pointer, click and wheel arms alike. When it is
//!   true the arm pushes an `InputEvent` onto `app.inputs` and `continue`s; the ladders see
//!   nothing. Four hand-written modal arms and their ordering left this file with it.
//! * `bridge::host_frozen` / `host_replaced` — the container's fold, replacing the pairs of
//!   `is_open()` / `host_ground_ready()` reads the update and draw phases each had to keep in step.
//! * `bridge::page_owned` — whether the dispatcher draws the top PAGE too, folded with
//!   `host_replaced` into `bridge::page_plan` (`Owned` / `LegacyThenSurfaces` / `SurfacesOnly`),
//!   which is what the page closure and `Dispatcher::draw`'s single call per frame both read.
//! * `Bridge::take_reqs` — what an owned screen asked this loop to do (`loop_requests`), because
//!   the machines that own sign-in and the app's real stack are not on the dispatcher yet.
//!
//! **Phase 10 moved the boot-trigger scripts out of this file.** Where this loop used to call a
//! local `dev_scripts` and hold each arm's own retry counters and oscillator phases as fields on
//! `App` directly (`app.dev.<flag>`), it now calls [`crate::dev::scenarios::each_frame`] — one
//! call at the same position `dev_scripts` occupied — and the per-arm state lives on
//! `app.scenarios`. The oscillator continuations invoked from `update()` (`nav_osc_tick`,
//! `hero_osc_tick`, `search_osc_tick`, …) and the replay-after-EOS check in `playback_tick` moved
//! the same way; see `dev::scenarios`'s own module doc for the full inventory.

    // A screen with nothing moving on it does not need to be re-sent to the panel. This
    // skips `glViewport`…`SDL_GL_SwapWindow` WHOLESALE — it is not dirty-RECTANGLE
    // tracking, which `ui/mod.rs`'s renderer doc rejects: when this says yes, the frame
    // below is byte-for-byte the immediate-mode frame it always was, clear and all.
    //
    // Measured cost of not doing this (2026-07-31): a still Home grid burns 16.0% of one
    // A53 core here plus ~19.4 points inside `surface-manager`, which must blend our
    // 1080p surface on every present — a charge that measured identical on three
    // different screens, so it is per-PRESENT, not per-pixel. ~35 points of a core to
    // re-send an unchanged picture, on a fan-less SoC that sits on Home for hours.
    //
    // **The exclusion is the BOUND PLANE, not the player ROUTE** (spec §9, phase 9).
    // `system.rs::clear_opaque_region` documents the hardware video plane as *slaved* to this
    // wayland surface, and "we stop presenting while a plane is slaved to it" is a claim about
    // this compositor that reading cannot settle — so while the plane is bound the gate
    // answers `true` unconditionally, and that term now lives INSIDE `should_present`, fed by
    // `Player::set_video_plane_bound`'s edges and by nothing else.
    //
    // What that changes is the frames on either side of a playback. Pre-bind (the spinner
    // while the route resolves and the Load is in flight) and post-unbind (the HUD fading out,
    // the failure read-out) are ORDINARY idle frames: nothing is slaved to the surface, so the
    // 35-points-of-a-core argument applies to them exactly as it does to Home — and every
    // player-side animator that advances from a clock has to report, or it freezes. Playback
    // itself still spends ~99% of its time with the HUD auto-hidden, where the frame is
    // already 0 draw calls.
    //
    // **The foreground demand is taken ONCE and has TWO terms** (spec §3.3 step 8): the
    // gate above, and whether the frame budget holds queued prepare work. The second term is what makes
    // the upload step below legal on the presenting side of the decision — a texture waiting
    // to be uploaded is itself a reason to present, so nothing sits in the queue behind a
    // settled screen. It was inert before phase 11: nothing in the product ever published a
    // queue to the budget, so `has_queued_work()` was permanently false and the upload had to
    // run BEFORE the decision (and invalidate) to happen at all.

    // Lifecycle is a hard outer gate: even noidle, a bound plane or queued uploads must
    // not reach EGL/Mali while SDL's window is backgrounded.
    //
    // A third term goes FIRST and short-circuits the other two: a page capture still in flight on
    // the GPU (`gfx::SNAPSHOT_THIS_FRAME`'s doc). Presenting now would only wait a whole vsync for
    // a buffer; not asking `should_present` leaves its damage and motion for the frame that does.
    // The simulator's settled capture (`NJ_SHOT_SETTLE`): once nothing has changed for the
    // asked-for quiet, invalidate so the NEXT present is the settled frame and `maybe_capture`
    // takes it. Before the decision below, so that invalidate selects this very frame.
