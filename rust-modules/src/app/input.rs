//! out of `app.rs` verbatim in phase 1a (a pure move; `pub(crate)` widening only).
//!
//! **Phase 5b (2026-09-07) took the consent and settings arms out of this file.** The Settings
//! family — Settings root, Legal, first-run/Settings consent, the Home-sources editor — is now

//! file keeps of consent is only the boot-time GATE deciding *when* to open the screen
//! (`maybe_ask_consent`), never an arm that reads its keys.

//! **Phase 6 (2026-09-07) did the same to the QR sign-in and the who's-watching picker.** Both

/// **`from_home` no longer decides anything here.** It selected `app::nav::menu_leave`, whose whole
/// body was `if from_home { trail.reset() }` — spending the history behind Home because the menu on
/// the root is the user acting on the root. Home IS the container's root, and a menu opened on it
/// is opened with nothing above that root, so the reset was a no-op in the only case that could
/// reach it; expressing it as a `Root(Home)` op would have been actively wrong, since the `Push`

// ---- the key ladder: one function per arm ------------------------------------------------------
//
// The run loop's key handler is a LADDER: a key-up, a hardware auto-repeat and the preamble every
// fresh press runs; then the DISPATCHER's arm and the route-scoped ones after it, each
// `continue`ing; then one chained `else if` on key identity. Each arm's BODY is a function here,
// in the order the ladder tries them — bar the ones with no body to name (the dispatcher's arm is
// one `app.inputs.push`, the pointer-hidden arm is empty). No count is given, deliberately: three
// arms left this ladder in phase 5b alone and every remaining player arm left it in phase 12, and
// a number here rots without anything failing.
//
// Every guard, every `continue` and the order itself stay at the CALL SITE, because the order is
// part of the behaviour: an earlier guard subsumes later ones it overlaps with, and that is only
// legible while the tests sit in one list, in order, in one place. (The clearest example used to
// be `key_player_failed`, whose guard deliberately subsumed every player arm below it; the whole
// group is `PlayerScreen`'s since phase 12, where the same precedence is the FIRST test in
// `handle_key` rather than the height of an arm in a chain.)
//
// No host test executes any of this: it runs inside the SDL event loop. The gate over it is
// `tools/keytable.py`, which drives the simulator through (screen x key) and diffs the focus
// fingerprint each press produces against a recorded table.

/// A key-up: the reliable release (this remote sends exactly one per press). Retires this sym from
/// the physically-down slot and springs a deferred grid-card press back.
///
/// It cleared a second slot — `HeldKey::sym`, the client-side hold-repeat's own — until phase 10
/// deleted that timer with its last consumer (the item menu). What is left is `down_sym`, which is
/// a fact about the PHYSICAL key rather than about whoever read it, and the press machine's
/// release, which is a fact about the LOOP's own deferred press. **Both are why this still runs
/// unconditionally, above the tree-ownership question**: a key the ladders never saw go down would
/// otherwise look held for as long as a surface was up.
///
/// **The scrub half is gone** (restructure phase 12, PX-PLAYER). It ran on
/// `PlayerScreen::scrub` — a field of a screen that has owned the whole gesture since it began
/// answering `HitSource::Engine`, and which arms its own `TAP_COMMIT_MS` debounce on
/// `Edge::Up` — so the two together issued TWO seeks for one tap. The commit, the debounce and
/// the reveal-cancel are `screens::player::PlayerScreen::key_scrub_release`'s now, and
/// `repause_at` reaches `commit_seek` through `PlayerReq::CommitSeek` instead of through here.

/// GUIDE, INFO, a universal remote's extra half — raised the transport over playback and cancelled
/// a press the user was in the middle of, and neither is a thing "the app ignored that key" is

/// Search's Backspace/Clear both classify as `Other` and are then taken by hand — so making the
/// variant inert would break all of them. `is_bound` is the superset that answers the actual
/// question.
///
/// Three things stay UNCONDITIONAL and each for its own reason. `down_sym` is bookkeeping

/// would each arrive as a fresh press (`state & 0x100 != 0 && sym == app.down_sym` in the
