//! Playback orchestration from the app core's side: the scrub/seek/position accessors, the
//! start/exit/finish of a playback, and the performers behind the requests the player page raises
//! ([`player_requests`]). Moved out of `app.rs` verbatim in phase 1a (a pure move; `pub(crate)`
//! widening only).
//!
//! **The HUD's timer, its cursor, the scrub gesture and the repeat gates are no longer here.**
//! Restructure phase 9 moved them into the player's own `Screen` instance
//! (`crate::screens::player`), with the types and the pure predicates in
//! `crate::screens::player::input`; this module re-exports the few names the loop still spells
//! unqualified. What that changed for a reader of the code below: `hud_until()`/`set_hud`/
//! `extend_hud`/`scrub()`/`set_scrub` are gone as free functions, because the values they read and
//! wrote are fields of a screen now (§2.3), and every arm that touches them takes that screen.
//!
//! **And the player's KEY HANDLERS are no longer here either** (phase 12, PX-PLAYER).
//! `key_player_failed`, `key_player_updown`, `key_scrub` and `seed_scrub` are deleted, not moved:
//! `PlayerScreen::step` had been answering the same keys through the dispatcher since the page
//! began reporting `FocusSource::Engine`, and these four went on writing that page's `hud`/`scrub`
//! from the loop beside it. What is left of the player here is the half a screen may not do —
//! [`commit_seek`], [`exit_player`], [`activate_player_row`], the transport toggle — each reached
//! through a `PlayerReq`.

// The list is what the LOOP still spells, and phase 12 (PX-PLAYER) is why it is short: the scrub
