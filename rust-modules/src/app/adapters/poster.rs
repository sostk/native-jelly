//! The application's SOURCE half of image caching (restructure spec §10): interning
//! `(server, path, w, h, png)` into an opaque [`PosterKey`] (a slot index), the transcode request
//! path and its token, the fetch + decode workers, the disk tier (`imgcache`), the prefetch gate
//! and the slot LRU. It delivers a decoded image as `tex::PosterReady` and holds NO texture: GL
//! residency is the library's [`crate::ui::tex::TexCache`], reached through `ui::tex`'s free
//! functions, and the seam between the two halves is the key. The library never names this
//! module; it sees it as the [`tex::Source`] installed at [`init`].
//!
//! A slot's lifecycle: EMPTY → WANT (claimed by a draw's miss or a prefetch) → LOADING (a worker
//! fetches + decodes off the lock) → DECODED (pixels waiting on the main thread) → READY (the
//! pixels were handed to the cache by [`drain_decoded`]; the cache uploads them in PREPARE),
//! EVICTED (the render cache could not keep that key resident, through rejection or pressure), or
//! FAILED / RETRY (a transient fetch parked under bounded backoff). EVICTED does NOT re-arm on
//! a prefetch: [`lookup`]'s `P_EVICTED` branch answers a `Touch::Warm` probe with dormancy before
//! the cooldown gate is even reached, so a background prefetch walking past an evicted key never
//! revives it. Only a `Touch::Draw` probe re-arms the slot — so a poster or backdrop that lost
//! residency off-screen does not quietly reappear before something asks to show it again; the pop
//! that eviction caused stays on screen until the draw that wants the key re-requests it. The
//! source cannot offer another upload from retained pixels because ownership moved to the render
//! cache and retaining a second CPU copy of the entire 44 MiB GL pool would defeat the memory
//! ceiling. A later demand follows the shared disk-first path for all reusable artwork: a usable
//! disk hit supplies compressed bytes, which still need decoding and uploading. A disk miss
//! needs a network fetch. Re-arming therefore still has a cost, bounded by the residency
//! thrash guard, the 250 ms–8 s cooldown backoff and the Draw-only gate above. A READY slot
//! recycled by [`victim`] frees its cache entry on the way out.
//!
//! Rust port of the old src/posters.c; rewritten on std::sync (a `Mutex<Store>` + `Condvar` +
//! two `task::spawn` workers). The decoded-pixel pointer is stored as an address (usize) so the
//! shared `Store` stays `Send`.
//!
//! ## Every entry point names a SERVER, and none of them assumes one
//!
//! Artwork is per-server in the strongest sense: `/photo/:/transcode?url=…` is a path on ONE
//! PMS, its `url=` is that server's own thumb key, and the token baked into it is that server's
//! grant. With a friend's shared server merged into one Home, "the current server" is the wrong
//! host for half the tiles on screen — so a [`ServerId`] rides every call, sits in the slot as
//! the other half of its identity, and is what the worker dials. Nothing in this file reads
//! `plex::client()`; a caller that genuinely means "the server I am browsing" says so by passing
//! `plex::current_server()`, at the call site, where it is visible.
//!
//! The server is a FIELD on the slot, not a prefix on the key, deliberately: keys already run
//! ~140 bytes (an ordinary relative thumb) to ~177 (an absolute headshot — see [`built_key`])
//! into a fixed [`PT_KEYLEN`]-byte array (see [`Pslot::key`]), and a `u16` compare is also the
//! cheaper half of the per-frame identity scan, so it goes first.

/// that particular cycle happen at all: it will not evict an entry drawn in the current or the

/// arrival outright (a steady skeleton, `PosterSource::unresident`'s `refused` case) rather than

/// its cooldown clears is still churning fetch/decode/upload without ever landing — this guard
/// paces how often that retry is allowed to turn, the same shape of problem the original review
/// named even though the mechanism producing it changed.
///
/// The guard is two pure decisions, both keyed off wall-clock ticks so they cost nothing under the
/// store lock and are host-testable without a real elapsed second (mirrors [`retry_due`] and the
/// residency log's own throttle):
///
/// - [`evict_was_rapid`]: was the PREVIOUS eviction of this key recent enough that this new one is
///   a continuation of an ongoing churn episode, rather than an isolated, ordinary LRU turnover?
///   Ten seconds comfortably exceeds one fetch+decode+upload round trip (the window this guard has
///   to see through), so a slot that settles for that long always gets treated as fresh again —
///   the window is sized against the round trip, not against how a person actually browses, so a
///   user who leaves a screen and comes back inside ten seconds can still land inside an ongoing
///   episode and pay whatever cooldown was already running, with no sustained overload involved.
/// - [`evict_backoff`]: given consecutive rapid re-evictions, how long does the NEXT re-arm wait?
///   Deliberately its own schedule rather than a reuse of [`retry_backoff`] — that one paces
///   retries against a server that may be down, capped at 30 s; this one paces retries against a
///   cache that is merely full, and a screen whose working set has genuinely settled should feel
///   that within a few seconds, not thirty.
///
/// **What the bound actually guarantees.** A key's FIRST eviction always has `evicted_at == None`
/// beforehand, so [`evict_was_rapid`] answers `false`, `evict_attempts` stays 0, and no cooldown is
/// set at all — the ordinary one-eviction-then-recovery case this PR exists to fix re-arms on the
/// very next Draw probe, exactly as before. Only a key that is evicted AGAIN inside the thrash
/// window — proof that something is still churning it — pays a cooldown, and that cooldown is
/// bounded ([`evict_backoff`] caps at 8 s): a Draw probe of the key is guaranteed another turn to

// server B's card be built from A's memoised, token-bearing path — a request to B carrying A's
// grant, which is a 401 at best. And the generation was one number for the whole memo, flushed
// when "the" token changed; with a table of servers there is no such number, so each entry
// remembers the generation it was built at and is rebuilt when THAT server's token moves.
