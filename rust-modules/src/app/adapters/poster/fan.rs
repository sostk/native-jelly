//! The collection FAN: what a collection shows when its thumb is the server's generated 2×2
//! composite (`/library/collections/{rk}/composite/{stamp}`), laid out as `Collections.dc.html`
//! G1 draws it. The first three members' posters are fanned in the UPPER part of the tile as
//! rounded cards with a rim and a soft shadow — the second rotated left behind, the third rotated
//! right behind, the first upright on top — over a four-corner gradient combined from their
//! `UltraBlurColors` (top-left from the left poster, top-right from the right one, both bottom
//! corners from the front one), with a bottom scrim so the collection's name, which the card sets
//! LIVE in the free lower part (`ui::collection_tile::draw_fan_name`), stays legible. The name is
//! never baked.
//!
//! **Rendered once.** The poster worker bakes on the CPU into ONE image, persists it as PNG under
//! a stamp-keyed [`nj_platform::imgcache::classify_baked`] entry, and delivers it as an ordinary
//! decoded poster through the store's normal admission, upload and LRU. The members' pixels live
//! only for the duration of one bake on one worker (three ~375 KB decodes plus the 540 KB output)
//! and never become GL textures. A warm disk hit decodes the baked PNG and fetches nothing.
//!
//! A custom poster (`/library/metadata/{rk}/thumb/…`) is untouched: only a path that
//! [`crate::catalog::collections::composite_parts`] reads as a composite is rerouted, at key
//! build time, to the synthetic `/plx/fan/{rk}/{stamp}` key this module parses back. The server's
//! composite is never a fallback: no usable member art is [`Got::Final`].
