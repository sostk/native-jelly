/// **The Library's Sort/Filter menu freezes the page under it, as its legacy `Popover` did.**
///
/// The reproduction of the `fps:library-switch` regression (restructure phase 8, device-measured
/// `loop=` 43-45 against a floor of 45, sustained 58 ms frames with `draw=57`). `sync_host` listed
/// the host-caching styles by hand and left `Style::Compact` out, so the one production Compact
/// surface — this menu — took no `HOST_USERS` share, `popover::host::page_pass` short-circuited on
/// `users() == 0`, and the whole library page (ambient wash, shelves, poster grid, every string on
/// it) was re-rendered on every frame the menu was open. Eight of the scene's fourteen steps hold
/// one open.
///
/// It grades the COUNTER rather than a frame time, because no host test draws a pixel: the counter
/// is the single bit that arms the freeze, and `modal::surface_policy` had said `HostRender::Cached`
/// for Compact all along.

/// **A page that MOVES under an open panel is the HOST moving** (spec §4.4, §15.1) — the sibling

/// direction and passed for the wrong reason while this one failed.
///
/// The reproduction, measured against the broken build (14 consecutive frames):
/// `moving=true page_moving=false` — the Library's own scroll spring in flight while the Sort menu
/// fades out, with `idle::page_moving()` reading FALSE for every one of them.
/// `frame_with_results` wrapped the WHOLE dispatcher frame in `popover::own_motion` while any
/// surface was up, so every spring an owned page stepped inside that frame was attributed to the
/// panel. `surface_up()` counts a `Closing` surface, and a `Closing` surface has already handed
/// input back to the page — which is exactly the state `popover::host_refresh`'s `fading_only`
/// term exists for. So the one signal that re-takes the frozen snapshot for a page the user is
/// driving again was suppressed by construction, and the panel's fade showed a stale picture of a
/// scrolling page.
///
/// **It has to be the LIBRARY, and it has to be `idle`.** The dispatcher keeps a motion ledger of
/// its own (`Present::page_moving`, reported as `FrameReport::underlay_moving`), but a screen only
/// reaches it by calling `fx.note(PresentEvent::Motion)` — which `screens::library` never does. It
/// animates through `crate::ui::Spring`, i.e. `gfx::spring`, which reports to `nj_machine::idle` and
/// nowhere else; `report.underlay_moving` is false on every frame below. `idle::page_moving()` is
/// the only witness there is.
