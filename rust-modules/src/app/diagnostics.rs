//! **Stats for nerds** — the on-screen diagnostics read-out, toggled from the player's `…` overflow
//! popover ([`crate::appkit::more_menu`]) and, since 2026-08-29, from the account menu
//! ([`crate::screens::account_menu`]) on every other route.
//!
//! # Where this lives, and why it is not a screen (restructure phase 10)
//!
//! It was `ui/stats.rs` and nine `static mut`s. It is `app/` because of what it is WRITTEN FROM —
//! `player::Diag`, `route`, `plex::identity`, `tv`, `devcaps`, `surface`: application facts, not
//! a design-system vocabulary — and its state is now one `App` field, [`Diagnostics`]. `ui/` keeps
//! what it always drew with (`widgets::FieldList` is still the list primitive).
//!
//! **Spec §13 files it as "a `ModalStack` instance" and that is the wrong shape**, decided in phase
//! 10 rather than deferred again. Two properties rule it out and both are stated at their own call
//! sites below: the panel takes NO KEYS AT ALL (see [`ON`]), so it can never be an input owner,
//! which is the whole of what a surface IS; and it draws at TWO z-positions — genuinely last on the
//! player route WHEN NONE OF THE PLAYER'S OWN PANELS IS OPEN (`bridge::player_diagnostics_visible`
//! skips the draw entirely instead, rather than reordering it, while one is — issue #163: `More`
//! carries this panel's own toggle, so painting over it hid the control), and over the page but
//! UNDER the account/item menus everywhere else, because on that path the menu carrying its own
//! off-switch sits in its corner. One entry in a z-ordered stack cannot express "sometimes above,
//! sometimes below, and sometimes not drawn at all".
//!
//! It was PLAYER-ONLY until then, and this doc said so: `app.rs` drew it inside the player branch,
//! so a toggle offered anywhere else would have ticked a box and shown nothing. The gap that
//! paragraph named — *"starts but finds no server", which never reaches a player* — is the report
//! this app most often needs from a stranger and was the one it could not produce. The draw call
//! now runs on both sides of `app.rs`'s player/non-player split, and the `else` half covers every
//! other route at once, so no route can be forgotten. The two positions differ deliberately: on the
//! player it is genuinely last EXCEPT while one of the player's own panels is open, and off it the
//! panel draws over the PAGE but UNDER the app's modal surfaces — because on that path something
//! sits in its corner, namely the account popover that carries the row turning it off. Drawn last
//! it hid its own off-switch — the same failure the player route grew once `More` gained the very
//! same kind of row (issue #163), fixed there by skipping the draw rather than reordering it.
//!
//! **Off the player the panel shows a DIFFERENT set of rows, and that is not a decoration.** Every
//! pipeline row reads a [`crate::player::Diag`] that has never been filled in, so all nine of them
//! report a zero — `stream never opened`, `no callbacks`, `NOTHING demuxed` — and most carry a
//! fault tint. Photographed on a Home screen where nothing is wrong, that is a picture of a broken
//! app, which is the exact opposite of what this panel is for. So when nothing has been asked to
//! play this session ([`never_played`]) the list is [`device_rows`] instead: what the SET is, what
//! its decoder claims, and what the server said — the facts a "it just does not work on my TV"
//! report needs and no log a stranger can reach will ever carry.
//!
//! # Why this exists, which is not why YouTube's does
//!
//! YouTube ships one so power users can argue about bitrate. This one is a support channel. The app
//! is reviewed and used on televisions nobody here owns — the webOS 6/10 playback failure that
//! prompted it was reported from hardware we cannot buy — and **every other diagnostic surface in
//! this codebase is compiled out of the build a user installs**: the ~40 `/tmp/nativejelly-*`
//! triggers, the remote FIFO and the capture stream all sit behind the `devtriggers` feature, which
//! `RELEASE=1` drops. What is left is "ssh in as root and send us `/tmp/nativejelly-events.log`",
//! which asks a stranger for shell access to their own television.
//!
//! A panel they can open with the remote and photograph with a phone needs none of that. So this
//! ships in RELEASE builds, and it opens no `/tmp` path, listens on no socket and reads no trigger —
//! it is a product feature, not a debug surface, and it must stay that way.
//!
//! # The photograph is the output format, and it dictates the design
//!
//! Three consequences, all of them load-bearing:
//!
//! **It must remain complete in a phone photo.** This is an engineering instrument opened on
//! purpose, so it uses the diagnostics-only 20px face over a near-black opaque ground: density and
//! stable coordinates matter more here than the product UI's couch-copy scale. No value is elided.
//! Pixel wrapping is cached with the 2 Hz snapshot, the panel grows to the measured lines, and an
//! oversized opaque token is split rather than losing its suffix. Severity is still carried by a
//! WORD as well as colour because a phone camera chroma-subsamples the result.
//!
//! **It must not become the screen.** It is a wide, shallow card inside the full overscan-safe
//! width, leaving most of the picture and the whole transport visible. Its two columns have fixed
//! schemas: stream/output on the left and delivery/control on the right. Manual, Auto/Original and
//! Auto/HLS replace values in place; they never remove rows and slide unrelated evidence around.
//! It never scrolls — a read-out that needs two photographs cannot be compared at one instant.
//!
//! **It must hold still.** Values are sampled at [`SAMPLE_MS`] and held, not read per frame. A
//! number that changes between the viewfinder and the shutter is a number the report cannot be
//! trusted on, and re-rendering ~20 volatile strings a frame would also thrash the whole-string
//! glyph cache, which is a measured failure mode in this repo rather than a worry.
//!
//! # What may never appear on it
//!
//! A photograph cannot be audited, edited, redacted, or scanned by anyone's secret detection — and
//! it lands in a public issue thread that is archived and indexed. So this panel is deliberately a
//! **strict subset** of what the event log records, with tighter rules, and the rules are
//! structural rather than a matter of care:
//!
//! * **No field is ever a URL or a path.** The PMS token rides in the query string of every
//!   playback and image URL, appended at one choke point in `plex::client`, so a URL-shaped field
//!   is a guaranteed credential leak rather than a possible one. Anything URL-derived is decomposed
//!   into non-secret parts (mode, endpoint KIND, throughput) before it can reach a draw call.
//! * **No credential, at any length.** Tokens are omitted, never masked: a PMS token is short,
//!   unstructured and shape-indistinguishable from an ordinary opaque id, so no reader will spot
//!   one and no prefix of it is safe to show.
//! * **No stable identity.** The server's friendly name defaults to the owner's hostname (commonly
//!   their real first name), and its `machineIdentifier` is a permanent household fingerprint that
//!   would link every photograph one person ever posts. Neither is shown, and neither is the
//!   address: nothing about a firmware playback bug depends on what the server is called or where
//!   it sits.
//! * **No viewing identity.** What is playing appears only as its technical shape — dimensions,
//!   position, duration, byte size, direct-play vs transcode. The title, episode title and summary
//!   are omitted: no playback bug depends on them, and they are what turns an anonymous technical
//!   photograph into an attributable one.
//!
//! The enforcement is structural: every row is built by [`pipeline_rows`]/[`model_rows`] from one
//! [`crate::player::Diag`] snapshot and a small set of route facts. The compositor's opaque window
//! id is reduced to `window ready`/`NO WINDOW`; the only server-derived text is the PMS release and
//! Pass state, never its name or address. There is no generic "push a string to diagnostics" path,
//! so adding a field is a deliberate edit to the file that carries these rules.
