/// what the host simulator links — has `SDL_KeyboardEvent { type, timestamp, windowID,
/// state:u8@12, repeat:u8@13, pad, pad, keysym{ scancode:u32@16, sym:i32@20, … } }`, so
/// every field the app reads is at a different offset and there is no webOS keycode at all.
/// Reading the fork's offsets out of a stock event yields the window id as a keystate and
/// a scancode as a sym — plausible-looking garbage rather than a crash.
///
/// `cfg!` rather than `#[cfg]` deliberately: both arms stay compiled on both platforms, so
/// the one nobody is currently building cannot rot. This is the single site that knows the
/// layout — `rd_u32`'s callers elsewhere read pointer events, whose offsets already agree.
///
/// **The `wcode` this returns is LG's SCANCODE**, which is worth saying because the name suggests
/// otherwise. Every field measured off the dev set is the SDL scancode of the key beside it —
/// backspace 42, Clear 156, ◀/▶ 80/79, OK 40 — so the fork's shift puts an ordinary
/// `SDL_Keysym { scancode, sym }` at +20/+24 rather than inventing a webOS keycode namespace. That
/// is why the codes above SDL's own range (450 play, 482 back, 505 exit) carry no sym at all: they
/// are LG-private scancodes the keymap has no keycode for. `docs/remote-keys.md` has the account.
///
/// # The simulator's carrier moved, because the old one was silently DEAD
///
/// A synthetic press from the remote FIFO has to get its wcode across `SDL_PushEvent`, and on the
/// host that queue is not SDL2's: macOS `libSDL2` is **sdl2-compat forwarding into SDL3**, so every
/// pushed event is converted out and back. Measured 2026-08-23 by dumping the polled bytes of a
/// press whose every spare field carried a distinct value:
///
/// | field                        | offset | survives |
/// |------------------------------|--------|----------|
/// | `windowID`                   |  +8    | yes      |
/// | `padding2` / `padding3`      | +14/15 | no       |
/// | `keysym.scancode`            | +16    | **no** — comes back 0 |
/// | `keysym.mod`                 | +24    | yes      |
/// | `keysym.unused`              | +28    | **no** — comes back 1 |
///
/// It used to be `unused`, so **every wcode-ONLY token was dead**: `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `ff`,
/// `rew`, `playpause`, `exit`, `chup`, `chdown` all decoded as wcode 1 and did nothing at all, and
/// `tests/keytable.json` recorded three of them as `moved: false` — which reads as "that key does
/// nothing on that screen" and actually meant the press never arrived. An instrument silent by
/// construction: prove it can see the thing before reading its silence.
///
/// `scancode` would have been the honest home (it is what a wcode IS) and it is the one field the
/// compat layer recomputes. So a synthetic press carries the value in `mod` and a MARKER in
/// `windowID` ([`SYNTH_WINDOW`]) — two fields, because the value alone cannot say whether it is
/// one: a real press puts its modifier bitmask in `mod`, so `mod != 0` means "shift is down" at
/// least as often as it means "injected". The marker restores the priority the `unused` field used
/// to express — **injected first, the desktop stand-in only as a fallback** — which is load-bearing
/// and not a preference: `host_wcode(8)` is BACK, while `remote_token_key`'s `backspace` token is
/// `(8, 42)`, so asking the stand-in first turns the panel's delete key into a navigation.
