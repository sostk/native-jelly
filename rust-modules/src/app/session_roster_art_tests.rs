//! **A roster commit must not blank the poster it does not change.** The session owner decides
//! what a roster result commits (its half is `auth::owner`'s scenario functions, which build the
//! commit plan); the registry changes that plan carries are executed here, under a poster slot
//! that is RESIDENT for the server, and the poster adapter
//! (`adapters::poster::resident_art_survives_for_test`) says whether that art still answers a draw
//! afterwards. The poster is an app adapter, so the grading lives in this layer.
