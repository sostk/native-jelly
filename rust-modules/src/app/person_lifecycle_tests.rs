//! Person page lifecycle across the deferred `AppFx::Store` effect queue (review round 1, P1):
//! Enter/Uncover decide whether to emit `Open` by reading the store synchronously, but Close and
//! Open are both deferred effects applied AFTER screen event delivery in the same drain. A stack
//! eviction (`ui::containers::stack::evict`, `CAP`) delivers `Unmount` to the evicted body — which
//! queues `Close` — in the SAME `Push` drain that mounts and `Enter(Fresh)`es a new page for the
//! same person identity. The new page's `Enter(Fresh)` observes the store still holding the
//! (soon-to-be-closed) identity and skips `Open`; the queued `Close` then lands after, leaving the
//! store empty under a page that never re-requests it.

/// Reproduces the exact sequence from the review finding: a Person A body sits at the bottom of a
/// `CAP`-full stack; the user reopens actor A's cast credit, whose `Push` evicts the bottom body
/// (queuing `Close` for the identity it still holds) in the same drain that mounts and
/// `Enter(Fresh)`s the new Person A page. The store must end up holding the person again.
