//! **The bridge between the legacy loop and the dispatcher** (restructure spec §14, phase 5b —
//! the shadow of phase 3b grown into the seam the migration crosses screen by screen).
//!
//! What lives here: the application's `Host` ([`AppHost`]) — its screen argument [`AppArg`],
//! which since phase 12 (D1) is the WHOLE page alphabet rather than a wrapper around a second one;
//! the mounter's one `match` ([`AppMounter`]); the rig the dispatcher borrows ([`Bridge`]: the real
//! `TtfMeasure`, the store deliveries of phase 4, the consent MACHINE, the loop requests an owned
//! screen makes); [`frame`], which the loop calls once per iteration with the inputs it collected
//! for the dispatcher; and — the part D1 added — **the loop's navigations as container ops**
//! ([`nav_root`], [`nav_push`], [`nav_pop`], [`nav_pop_to`], [`nav_cancel`], [`nav_tab`],
//! [`show_page`], [`open_detail`], [`switch_profile`], [`background`], [`foreground`]). Those are
//! the seam: the `Route` enum, `app/nav.rs` and `ui/trail.rs` were a SECOND navigation system
//! kept in step with this one by a per-frame `sync_page`, and every place the two could disagree
//! was a bug nobody could see. There is one authority now, and it is the container.
//!
//! The coexistence contract (§14), stated once:
//! - **Input.** The loop's ladders ask [`Dispatcher::owns_input`] before their first arm. While a
//!   surface is up, or the top page is an owned one, every key, pointer move, click and wheel is
//!   an `InputEvent` for the dispatcher and the ladders see nothing. Otherwise the ladders answer
//!   as they always did and the dispatcher receives no input.
//! - **Draw.** The loop draws the tree at the positional point its own frame reserves for the
//!   Settings family (after the page and the compact popovers, under the dev glass), on ITS
//!   present gate: [`Dispatcher::draw`]. Owned pages are drawn in the page closure instead.
//!   Navigation presentation is captured into `DrawFrame` once per pass; surfaces keep their own
//!   appear alpha. The dispatcher's own gate wanting a present becomes `idle::invalidate`.
//! - **The host under a surface.** The dispatcher's host fold is the loop's freeze/skip decision
//!   (`host_frozen`/`host_replaced`), and the surface's phases drive `popover`'s host-user
//!   counters ([`sync_host`]) so the FrameCache snapshot and the tab glass behave exactly as they
//!   did under the legacy `Popover`.
//! - **Words.** The heartbeat's `overlay=` reads the topmost surface's `Screen::name`
//!   ([`overlay_word`]), so the fps tier's word table is unchanged (§15.3).
//! - **The three privileged calls.** `ls2_pump`'s rig hook is still a no-op (3b's reason: the
//!   dispatcher does not yet run a phase this early in the frame). `opaque_route` and
//!   `clear_opaque_region` stopped being no-ops in phase 9 — the rig's hooks are real, but they
//!   delegate to `app/run.rs::rig_opaque_route`/`rig_clear_opaque_region` rather than naming
//!   `nj_platform::tv::window::` here, which is what keeps the OS-facing call text in one file (D4;
//!   `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `frame` gate).
