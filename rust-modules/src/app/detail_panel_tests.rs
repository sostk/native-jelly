/// **A Detail page's own panel PARKS across a push and comes back the same instance.**
///
/// The property that makes a page-owned surface page-owned (spec §6.2, `Navigation.covered_modals`):
/// present a panel on Detail, push Person over it, pop back, and the panel is still there — same
/// `InstanceId`, same cursor, same rows — rather than a fresh mount or nothing at all.
///
/// **Written against the broken behaviour first, and simulated rather than historical.** The legacy
/// panel was a module-level `static mut POP`, so this cannot be compiled against it at all: `POP`
/// belonged to the process, not to the page, and the question "which page's panel is this" had no
/// answer to assert on. The red was produced by narrowing `Navigation::commit`'s park branch to do
/// nothing (drop the `covered_modals.push`), which is exactly the defect this property guards:
/// with it, the surface is torn down by the orphan sweep on the push and the pop comes back with an
/// empty modal stack — `assert_eq!(d.nav.modals.surfaces.len(), 1)` fails at 0.
