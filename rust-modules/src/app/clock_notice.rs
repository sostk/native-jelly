//! Tell the viewer, once per app run, that the television's clock is wrong and the app is serving
//! the server by its remembered key (issue #378's key mode).
//!
//! `net::keypin` publishes the fact ([`keypin::engaged`], and a [`keypin::revision`] that moves
//! when any fact changes); this is the one consumer that acts on it, through the television's own
//! toast ([`nj_platform::tv::toast`]). It is polled from the frame loop, so it works on every route:
//! at an offline cold boot key mode first engages during the startup connect, long before any
//! screen could carry a read-out of its own.
//!
//! **Once per run, and never retried.** The flag is set when the attempt is MADE, not when it is
//! accepted: a television that refuses the toast would otherwise be asked again on every
//! revision, and a person who did not see the first one is not helped by the fortieth. The latch
//! lapsing and re-engaging (every ten minutes of key mode) changes nothing here, because
//! `engaged` records the first engagement and the flag is already down.
//!
//! The toast call blocks for an LS2 round trip, so the message is built here, on the frame thread
//! (the locale is read from it), and the call runs on a small worker.
