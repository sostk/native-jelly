    //! or a modal question, back where the platform call now goes. [`after_cancel`] is pure,
    //! because its callers reach `auth`/`tv`, neither of which a unit test wants to drive.
    //!
    //! **Phase 6 retired the other half this module doc used to describe** — `onboarding_back`,
    //! `OnboardBack` and their five tests, which pinned issues #16-#18's rule as it was reached from
    //! the legacy `key_onboarding` key ladder. The RULE did not change (the Session adapter
    //! performs the `after_cancel` policy those tests exercised); what moved is WHO decides "is this press the screen's own
    //! modal or the app's root" — since phase 6 that is `screens::login`/`screens::profiles`'s own
    //! job, reading their own focus-engine state (a PIN pad's open flag, on the owned
    //! `ProfilesScreen`) that this module cannot see and must not reach into (`app/` never names a
    //! sibling `screens/` module's internals). A host test of that half now belongs beside the
    //! screens that make the decision, not here.
    //!
    //! What NO host test can say is that the television actually shows its launcher and that the
    //! process survives it. That is the port's device half of `tv::home::go_home` — `gohome: SAM accepted`, a
    //! capture of the launcher (on webOS 4 a RIBBON over the still-running app, so no lifecycle
    //! event at all) and `fuser` reporting one pid throughout — and it is why this file's
    //! `home_requests` counter grades the DECISION and never the outcome.
