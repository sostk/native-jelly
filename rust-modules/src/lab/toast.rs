//! The lab upload's read-out: **"Uploading diagnostics…" → "Diagnostics uploaded" or a reason**.
//!
//! Lab builds only (`crate::lab`, which owns it — it was `ui/lab_toast.rs` until the UI library
//! had to stop naming the lab's upload state), and it is the only thing this feature ever puts on
//! screen. Its whole job is to answer, in a rented Cloud Test Lab hour with no console and no log,
//! the one question a tester has after pressing the button: *did anything happen*. A silent
//! trigger and a trigger that is not delivered at all look identical, and one of those is a bug in
//! this feature while the other is the colour-button question (`docs/lab-diagnostics.md` §7) — so
//! the read-out appears the moment the press is TAKEN, before the network is involved, and then
//! changes.
//!
//! # Where it sits, and why not where the other read-out sits
//!
//! Top RIGHT normally; immediately BELOW the diagnostics read-out when both are shown — its frame
//! arrives as a parameter (`app::diagnostics`, phase 10). The diagnostics panel is
//! the state, the toast is whether the state got out, and neither may cover the other. Both stay
//! inside the overscan frame (`consts::MARGIN_X`) because a lab set is one nobody here can measure,
//! so nothing may rely on the panel showing every pixel.
//!
//! It takes NO KEYS: it is not a route, not a modal and has no dismiss. Every key keeps doing what
//! it did, which matters when the upload is triggered from the playback failure read-out — the
//! screen a tester most wants a snapshot of, and one whose own key arm swallows everything.
