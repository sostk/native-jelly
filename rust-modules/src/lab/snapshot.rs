//! The uploaded document: **one envelope line, then one JSON record per ring line** (JSONL).
//!
//! The consumer is a coding agent, not a person, so the format is machine-readable end to end and
//! the envelope carries the structured state that no log line states in one place. It is built in
//! this one file on purpose — that is what makes "what may appear in an upload" a rule with a
//! single edit point rather than a habit spread over the modules that produce the data.
//!
//! # What may appear, and what may not
//!
//! The envelope is assembled from [`crate::player::Diag`], [`nj_platform::tv::device`] and
//! [`nj_platform::devcaps`], whose fields are numbers, bools, enums and short platform strings.
//! `app::diagnostics`'s module doc states the rule those types already live under and the reasoning
//! behind each clause; it applies here unchanged and for a stronger reason, since an upload
//! crosses the public internet rather than a room:
//!
//! * **no URL and no path** — the PMS token rides in the query string of every playback and image
//!   URL, so a URL-shaped field is a guaranteed credential leak rather than a possible one;
//! * **no credential at any length** — omitted, never masked, because a PMS token is short and
//!   shape-indistinguishable from an ordinary opaque id;
//! * **no stable identity** — not the server's friendly name (commonly the owner's first name),
//!   not its `machineIdentifier` (a permanent household fingerprint), not its address;
//! * **no viewing identity** — what is playing appears only as its technical shape.
//!
//! # Defence in depth: [`scrub`]
//!
//! Ring records are ordinary log lines, and the log's own policy — *no call site formats a URL into
//! a line* — has been violated before (`nj_base::eventlog::redact_tokens`'s doc carries that history: one
//! `-> {url}` in `route::retranscode`, reached by an ordinary audio-track switch, live for months).
//! So every record passes a second, broader pass on the way out. It is deliberately not the same
//! function as the log's: that one is a hot-path backstop for one parameter name, this one is a
//! wider sweep that runs once per upload on a worker thread and can afford to be thorough.
