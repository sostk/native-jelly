//! The upload itself: **snapshot on the main thread, send on a worker**.
//!
//! # The split, and why it is exactly here
//!
//! [`crate::player::diag`] is main-thread by contract — the panel it was written for must not tell
//! a story that never happened, so the whole struct is one instant's read. Everything after that
//! (scrub, serialise, gzip, TLS, the blocking POST) is unbounded work on a link we do not control,
//! and none of it may touch the SDL loop: the feed pump, the ACB control calls and the render all
//! live there. So [`request`] samples and hands off, and the worker never calls back into the app
//! except through atomics.
//!
//! `task::spawn_small` rather than `thread::spawn`, for this crate's usual reason: a refused spawn
//! is a return value here, not a panic that kills the app (`task.rs`, and the `RLIMIT_NPROC`
//! measurement in `tools/threadprobe.c`). A refusal shows in the toast as a failure, which is the
//! honest reading.
//!
//! # Single flight
//!
//! One upload at a time, refused rather than queued. The trigger is a button a tester presses when
//! nothing appears to be happening, so the realistic input is four presses in two seconds; a queue
//! would answer that by sending four near-identical documents over a link that was already the
//! reason nothing appeared to happen.
