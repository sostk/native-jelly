//! **Lab Diagnostics** — the app pushing its own log off a television nobody here can reach.
//!
//! LG Cloud Test Lab rents physical sets on webOS/SoC combinations we do not own. It gives a
//! picture and a virtual remote, and **no console, no ssh, no stdout and no way to download a
//! file**. So a bug can be reproduced on a k8hpp webOS 10 set, watched happening, and the agent
//! fixing it cannot see one line of `nativejelly-events.log`. Every other diagnostic surface in this
//! repository assumes ssh (`crate::dev`'s ~44 `/tmp` triggers, the remote FIFO, the capture
//! listener, `make -s print-eventlog`) and is therefore unreachable there.
//!
//! This module is the bridge: a **bounded ring of the log lines the app already writes**, plus the
//! structured state `crate::player::Diag` already carries, uploaded over pinned TLS to a receiver
//! on the developer's Mac (`tools/nativejelly-lab`), triggered by a remote button, a menu row or the
//! optional authenticated command channel. `docs/lab-diagnostics.md` is the design note; read it
//! before extending any of this.
//!
//! # Three rules, all structural rather than a matter of care
//!
//! 1. **It is not in any build a user can install.** The whole module is behind the
//!    `lab-diagnostics` cargo feature, which — unlike `devtools`/`devtriggers` — is **not in the
//!    default set at all**, so a release build cannot acquire it by forgetting a flag. Without the
//!    feature every entry point below is a compile-time no-op: no ring, no allocation, no key arm,
//!    no config read, no socket, no thread.
//! 2. **Call sites carry no `#[cfg]`.** The event log's tap, `app.rs`'s key ladder,
//!    `ui::consts::is_bound` and the two menus all call plain functions that fold away (`labcfg`'s
//!    two answers, for `ui/`, `appkit/` and `screens/`). That is `nj_base::devtrig`'s shape and it is
//!    deliberate: hand-written `#[cfg]` PAIRS at call sites are the one hazard
//!    `.claude/hooks/release-config-check.py` exists for, and the gating lives in two files
//!    (`lab/mod.rs`, `labcfg/mod.rs`) instead of eight.
//! 3. **Nothing enters the payload that is not already allowed on a photograph.** The envelope is
//!    built from `Diag`, `tv::device::Info` and `devcaps::Caps` — numbers, bools, enums and short
//!    platform strings — under the same no-URL / no-credential / no-identity rule `app::diagnostics`
//!    states at length, and every ring record passes [`snapshot::scrub`] on the way out on top of
//!    the `redact_tokens` it already passed on the way in. See [`snapshot`].
//!
//! # What it deliberately is not
//!
//! Not analytics, not a crash service and not general device administration. Lab Control can ask
//! this app to replay only its bounded synthetic-input/test token grammar; it cannot invoke a
//! shell, read a file, call an arbitrary URL or control webOS outside this SDL process. Both
//! directions are initiated by the television as pinned, authenticated HTTPS POSTs.

// `lab.json`'s reader, `is_trigger_key` and `menu_row_enabled` live in `nj_platform::labcfg` (platform):
// `ui/` and `screens/` ask those two questions and may not name this module.
