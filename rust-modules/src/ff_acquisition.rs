//! **One acquisition policy, not two independently-optional parameters, and sealed against the
//! bypass that caused it.** `hls_demux_segment` used to take `(ReserveDeadlineState,
//! Option<StallGuard>)`, and every combination of the two compiled — including "no reserve
//! deadline AND no stall guard", which is exactly what `hls_prefetch_same_encoder`'s same-encoder
//! lookahead built (`ReserveDeadlineState::new(None, false), None`, unconditionally). That is how
//! a rung-20000 link collapse to 500 kbps (`pipe_abr_down_collapse`, segment 11, 5.4 MB) ran
//! 86.8 s and froze the picture for ~84s: the lookahead fetched that very segment and never
//! evaluated a terminal-reserve abort at all, because nothing forced it to.
//!
//! Replacing the pair with one required, role-typed argument was the first fix; it was not
//! enough on its own, because `ff` is one module and `SegmentAcquisition::Active { stall: None,
//! .. }` was just as constructible by hand inside `ff` as the two-parameter call it replaced.
//! This module is the second half: `SegmentAcquisition`'s payload lives in a private inner enum
//! (`Policy`) that `ff` cannot name, so the only way `ff` can produce an `Active` acquisition at
//! all is [`SegmentAcquisition::for_cursor`] — which is also the only place the
//! `arm_active_stall_guard` evaluation runs, from inputs it samples itself rather than inputs a
//! caller hands it.
