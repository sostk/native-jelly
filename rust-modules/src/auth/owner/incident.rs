//! * **Permission is an INPUT, not a read.** This owner is pure and replayable, so the consent
//!   decision reaches it as [`Command::ResolveIncident`], sent by the screen that would present the
//!   offer, together with the `consent::revision` it was derived at. An Offered incident is
//!   re-resolved whenever that revision moves: a Yes at the onboarding scope turns it into a
//!   standing send, a No drops it.
//! * **Dedup is per LAUNCH, keyed on (flow, kind, link).** A resolved key is remembered in
//!   `SessionInit::incidents_seen`; `restart_login` mints a new epoch on every *Try again*, and a
//!   per-epoch key would ask the same question after every press. The failure already held keeps
//!   its offer and its answer, while its separate read-out context advances to the current run. A
//!   seen key coming back after a DIFFERENT failure is raised again — the read-out must never show
//!   another failure's Details — but resolved quietly: OnRequest,
//!   behind Details only, never the alert and never a standing send.
//! * **A newer incident supersedes** whatever is held — never a second alert. A reply for the
//!   superseded one is fenced by its id.
//! * **Every sign-in ending names its incident** (`SessionMachine::fail_login`): a worker's
//!   failure carries its own evidence, an ending inside the app raises
//!   `IncidentKind::Internal`, and an ending the report does not cover retires what is held.
//! * **Declined forgets the report context.** *Details → Send report* builds one at press time
//!   from the key ([`IncidentReport::AtPress`]), or from the still-visible save warning’s closed
//!   failure classification and diagnostic snapshot. The local warning keeps only those closed
//!   fields regardless of consent; both report paths reconstruct the same evidence from them.
//! * **A stalled wait is offered through Details only** (`IncidentKind::alert_eligible`,
//!   `IncidentKind::standing_eligible`): the QR code is still on screen, possibly mid-scan, so no
//!   permission puts the alert over it, and none sends it automatically. Granted and undetermined
//!   both resolve it to OnRequest — the status line and *Details → Send report*, a one-off sent
//!   only on that press. Declined still drops it. OnRequest is re-resolved on a revision move, so
//!   a later No forgets its evidence just as it would an Offered one's.
//! * **Queued is not delivered.** Both lanes hand back the report's event id when they TAKE it;
//!   what became of it afterwards is observed by the session adapter (`telemetry::delivery`) and
//!   arrives as [`IncidentDelivery::Held`], [`IncidentDelivery::Delivered`] or
//!   [`IncidentDelivery::Undelivered`], each fenced by the id AND the receipt it is about. The
//!   screen only renders the state; it never samples telemetry.
//! * Sign-out and *Delete all local data* erase the offer and the seen keys with everything else.
