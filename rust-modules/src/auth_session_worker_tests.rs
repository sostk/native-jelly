/// **The invariant phase 6 exists to establish, pinned by reading the source.** Nothing else

/// compiles cleanly, passes every OTHER test in this file (none of them spin up a real worker
/// thread against a real plex.tv — see the module doc), and only misbehaves on a device, under
/// contention nobody happened to be watching for. Modelled on `eventlog::scrub`'s
/// `no_log_call_site_interpolates_viewing_content`, which pins its own "the mechanism is that
/// nobody writes it" claim the same way.
///
/// **What this test actually checks, restated after a reviewer found the gap in the stronger
/// sentence this comment used to make ("no `with_ctl` call at all", full stop).** That claim
/// was true of the two DIRECT spellings this test greped for and false of a WRAPPED one: the
/// reviewer added `set_error_if_live(epoch, "…")` to `login_thread` — the exact pre-phase-6
/// call [`LoginProgress::Failed`]'s doc says is retired — and it reached `with_ctl` two hops
/// down (`set_error_if_live` → `set_error` → `with_ctl`) while this test kept reporting green,
/// because a two-hop wrapper call is neither `with_ctl(` nor `CTL.lock(` in the CALLER's own
/// text. Three checks run per function now, not two: the original direct-spelling pair, PLUS
/// [`calls_a_function_prefixed`] against `set_`, the naming family every `Ctl`-writing setter
/// in this file already belongs to — which catches `set_error_if_live(` (and `set_error(` on
/// its own) by the family, not by a name typed into this test.
///
/// **What is still NOT proven, and this says so rather than overclaiming again:** a wrapper
/// that reached `Ctl` under a name outside the `set_` convention would still slip past a
/// textual scan — closing that fully needs a real call-graph walk (or moving `Ctl` behind an
/// interface a worker's module cannot name at all), not a longer prefix list. This is a
/// materially stronger gate than the one it replaces, scoped to say exactly that.
///
/// This original QR-specific guard stays beside the broader R2A boundary below because it also
/// scans the helper chain called by login discovery. Profile, roster and endpoint workers are
/// covered by [`all_auth_worker_bodies_are_observation_only`].
