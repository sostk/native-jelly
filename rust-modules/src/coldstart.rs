//! Retirement of the old persisted last-page bookmark.
//!
//! A cold boot now always settles on the route selected by the credential flow: normally Home.
//! Home's Hero and Continue Watching rows are the product's single resume affordance; reopening a
//! previous Detail or Library route here would compete with them and make Home's primary content
//! redundant. This policy does not affect the live app-switch lifecycle in `app.rs`: an in-process
//! playback can still be suspended and resumed while the app remains alive.
//!
//! Builds before 2026-09-01 wrote `lastplace.json` beside the persisted session. Keep this tiny
//! one-shot cleanup until those installations have had a chance to upgrade, so the retired route
//! and its server identifier do not remain on disk indefinitely. No new bookmark is ever written.
