//! The **Skip Intro / Skip Credits** control. While the playhead sits inside one of the playing
//! leaf's server markers (`metadata::playing_markers`, fetched with `?includeMarkers=1`) this
//! button TAKES THE PLACE of the transport's Subtitles/Audio discs — same row, same right edge,
//! same height — and the discs return the moment the segment ends.
//!
//! Replacing them rather than joining them is the design call: one wide unmissable target in the
//! spot the eye already goes for transport controls. The cost is that CC/Audio are unreachable for
//! the length of the segment, and that the button only exists while the HUD is up — which is why
//! `app.rs` RAISES the HUD once when a segment begins and parks focus here, so a bare OK still
//! skips in one press instead of three.
