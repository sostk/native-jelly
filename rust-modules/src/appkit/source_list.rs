//! **The Sources ROW MODEL** — one list of libraries grouped by server, drawn on two surfaces.
//!
//! The Library toolbar's Source panel (`screens::library::menu`, deliverable A) and the Favorite libraries
//! editor — first run, and its Settings twin (`crate::screens::onboard`, deliverable F) — show
//! the SAME list:
//! your servers, each server's libraries, and which of them are favorites. The canvas says so in as
//! many words — F "is the same list as A's On Home level, in the flow's own frame rather than a
//! panel" — so it is one builder, and the two screens differ only in the frame around it, in the
//! LEVEL they ask for, and in whether the roster-refresh row rides along.
//!
//! **They no longer differ in a control.** The panel used to carry a `TabPill::segment` pair at its
//! top swapping its own two levels; the levels are now a property of the SURFACE, one each and
//! fixed — the panel is a picker, the editor is the switches — so there is nothing to swap and the
//! pills are gone. That was never only a tidy-up: with the switch governing the whole app rather
//! than Home alone, a picker that could turn into an editor would let a library be un-favourited
//! from inside the list of favourites and then vanish out of it under the cursor.
//!
//! Building it twice would have been the ordinary thing to do and the wrong one: the two would
//! have drifted on exactly the details that make the list readable — which column carries a mark,
//! which carries a word, what an unreachable group says and where it says it — and each drift
//! would read as a bug on whichever screen you saw second.
//!
//! Pure over its inputs, so it is host-testable without a live section table (which is also why
//! `browse` hands out owned [`SrcGroup`](crate::browse::SrcGroup)/[`SrcRow`](crate::browse::SrcRow)
//! projections rather than borrows of its statics).
