//! In-player modal track menu: audio + subtitle pickers over the video, rendered on the reusable
//! animated `TableView` (Apple-TV "settings" look — a sliding pill selection, section header with
//! a codec accessory, per-row badges, a leading checkmark on the active track). app.rs routes
//! D-pad/OK/BACK here while the menu is open; LEFT/RIGHT switch between the Audio and Subtitles
//! panels on a root (on the Subtitles tab LEFT pops a sub-page and RIGHT on a Nav row enters it;
//! BACK pops a sub-page before it dismisses). The selection commit (native audio switch / server transcode / burn) is unchanged
//! from the previous procedural version — only the presentation moved onto the table.
//!
//! **The Subtitles panel is grouped, not one flat list** (plan `subtitle-menu-capsule` §3,
//! `/tmp/dsplayer/player.html:1104-1162`): Off and every single-track "yours" language sit under
//! one "Subtitles" header; a "yours" language with several tracks gets its own section (header =
//! language, `accessory("N tracks")`), ranked full < SDH < forced < commentary; everything else is
//! ONE "Other languages" row (a drill-in to [`TrackPage::OtherLanguages`], one row per language
//! A-Z; a multi-track language there drills in again to [`TrackPage::Language`], its tracks
//! ranked); and a headerless section holds Timing and Style. That
//! grouping is a pure DATA model, `metadata::sub_layout` (host-tested without a
//! `PlaybackSession`/`MetadataView` fixture); this module only turns it into `TableView` sections
//! ([`table_form`]) and answers focus/OK by the focused row's [`TrackRow`] identity. "Yours" is
//! the pref language (if the play resolved under one), the playing audio's language, and the
//! current subtitle's own language, in that order (`route::cur_sub_pref_lang`, carried in by
//! `screens::player::overlay`).
//!
//! **Both tabs are keyed declarative forms** (`ui::form`, `docs/player-submenus.md`): each row is
//! declared once with its semantic [`TrackRow`] identity, a stable [`RowKey`] (a family base plus
//! the track's index in the playing item's list, which is fixed for the item's lifetime, never the
//! list position), its kind and its [`Row`]. The focus layer's element is the row's key, so a row
//! added above another (a subtitle offered mid-play, the enhancement pair returning) moves no key,
//! and a rebuild restores the viewer's row by id.
//!
//! **Timing** is a single value row that reads out the current offset (no chevron: it is a
//! hand-off, not a page); OK on it does not step anything here — it returns
//! [`TrackOk::OpenTiming`], which `screens::player::overlay`'s `activate` turns into a hand-off: it
//! dismisses this panel and presents the Timing capsule overlay (`OverlayKind::Timing`,
//! `appkit::timing_capsule`) in its place. The row is dim and inert while subtitles are Off (OK there
//! neither opens the capsule nor closes the panel), and Timing together with Style is omitted
//! while the playing conversion burns the subtitle into the picture (`route::client_renders_subtitle`),
//! where no client-side offset or style can reach; a conversion that delivers it softly keeps both. When the live route is instead this app's OWN Plex Pass audio-enhancement
//! Burn (M7), both stay visible — dim, with a one-line reason (`Row::note`) — so the viewer who
//! turned Boost dialog / Normalize loudness on sees why the control is locked rather than finding
//! it simply gone.
//!
//! **Style is a drill-in, and the Subtitles tab is a page stack** (`docs/player-submenus.md`). The
//! Style row is a [`RowKind::Nav`] onto [`TrackPage::Style`], whose Size, Position and Color rows
//! each read out their current value and push a picker page ([`TrackPage::Picker`]) of
//! [`RowKind::Choice`] rows with the current rung checked. A push remembers the opener's id and the
//! scroll ([`page_stack::Saved`]); a pop ([`TrackMenuState::pop`], LEFT or BACK, or a click on the title band,
//! whose pointer-only stop is [`TITLE_KEY`]) restores both, so focus returns to the row that opened
//! the page by id. OK or RIGHT on a Nav row pushes ([`TrackMenuState::on_right`]); LEFT on the root
//! is still the tab switch and BACK on the root dismisses. Every page opens on an explicit id
//! ([`TrackMenuState::page_initial`]). A picker pick commits live and leaves the panel and page
//! open ([`TrackOk::Commit`]'s `keep_open`), so a run of picks is felt at once.
//!
//! **What Style can reach depends on the active renderer** ([`SubRenderer`]): only the client's
//! plain-text caption follows Size and Position, so under an image (PGS/VobSub) or native ASS/SSA
//! subtitle those two rows are dim, focusable and inert, with a separate note each. Color stays
//! live under every renderer: the subtitle ink tints bitmaps and ASS alike. Size and Position are
//! persisted by `route::select_subtitle_size` / `select_subtitle_position` (live value first, a
//! persist-only write second); Color by `player::set_subtitle_tone`.
//!
//! **A sub-page never outlives the root it was built on.** The root's [`SubSig`] — subs
//! fingerprint, active index, renderer kind, transcoding, own-burn and enhancement route — is
//! stored when the root is built and compared on every live poll; a mismatch refreshes the root in
//! place, and a sub-page in place too — it pops straight to the root only when its availability no
//! longer holds (the renderer, or whether Style is shown / locked). The replay canon
//! ([`TrackMenuState::canon`]) carries the tab, the page path with each return key, and the
//! selected key.
//!
//! **The Other languages flow** is data-driven by [`TrackMenuState::other`] (one `OtherLang` per
//! language, from the same `sub_layout` answer as the root), so a page lists exactly what its
//! opener promised. A language is identified by the Plex stream id of its first track in the item's
//! FULL list ([`LangId`], carried by [`TrackRow::OpenLang`] and [`TrackPage::Language`]), never a
//! list position, so tracks leaving or arriving cannot relabel an open page. A track pick on any
//! page commits and dismisses like a root pick. A page whose listing is gone (the language left the
//! offered list) pops to the root ([`TrackMenuState::pages_hold`]); a language page that drops to a
//! single track stays open, and popping it lands on that track's direct row.
