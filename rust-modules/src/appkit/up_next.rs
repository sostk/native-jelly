//! **Up Next** — the next-episode tile in the transport HUD (`Player Screen.dc.html`, the control
//! row's third occupant). It appears when the playing episode reaches a FINAL credits marker (one
//! that runs to the end of the item) and the PlayQueue has another episode behind it, under the
//! default Next episode preference (Up Next countdown): the next episode's still, its address and
//! name, and a countdown that starts it on its own.
//!
//! The data is `route::up_next()` — lifted from the `continuous=1` PlayQueue that every playback
//! already creates, so nothing here asks the server what plays next.
//!
//! It TAKES THE PLACE of the transport's Subtitles/Audio discs — the same control row the Skip
//! button uses, the same right edge — with the still and its caption stacked directly above. The
//! countdown is the primary button's own fill sweep (`Button::progress`), so the control and the
//! timer are one object rather than a button beside a rail.
//!
//! **Two buttons, and they are deliberately not equals** (the design's own note): *Next Episode*
//! takes the [`ctrl_slot`](crate::appkit::player_hud::ctrl_slot) width — the floor that keeps the row
//! from visibly shrinking when it appears — while *Watch Credits* takes only its own label's, since
//! a second full-width capsule would read as a pair of equals when one continues watching and the
//! other does nothing at all. They are laid out in that spatial order, so LEFT reaches Watch
//! Credits and RIGHT returns.
//!
//! It is HUD furniture, not an overlay: playback keeps running underneath and the credits keep
//! rolling. That is what makes the countdown honest — `app.rs` holds the HUD up for as long as it
//! is armed, so the timer is never running behind a hidden transport.
//!
//! **The row's cursor is not kept here.** It is `hud_nav.btn`, exactly as it is for the discs, so
//! LEFT/RIGHT need no special case and [`ControlSlot::items`](crate::appkit::player_hud::ControlSlot)
//! answers for the clamp. This module owns the countdown and nothing else — which is also why the
//! cancel rule lives at `app.rs`'s one frame block rather than being spread across the key arms.
//!
//! *(A full-screen post-play CARD — show poster, DISPLAY title, countdown ring — was built for the
//! cross-show case and lives at commit `84ff9328`. It is not here because its trigger does not
//! exist: `continuous=1` is per-show, and a final episode returns `totalCount=1`, so the queue
//! never hands us a different show. Sourcing it from Continue Watching is the owner's call.)*
