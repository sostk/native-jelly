/// menu's rows and `search::recents`' per-profile store all read it, and a picker that has
/// announced a profile boundary must not be standing over a process that still knows who was
/// watching. The generation bump is what makes the second half take effect; see `session::current`.

/// tile with no network), which is not a credential boundary, since that path refuses a tile CACHED
/// as protected and every such PIN still goes to plex.tv.
///
/// So a RESTART re-attaches through the BOOT GATE rather than through this one, and what happens
/// there is that gate's policy, not this one's: with a roster of more than one it raises a picker
/// unless Automatically Sign In is on and a profile is already seated
/// ([`crate::catalog::session::Session::boot_shows_picker`]), and with a roster of one or none
/// `app.rs` installs the stored profile directly, PIN or no PIN. Two known staleness/policy gaps
/// sit behind that sentence and are deliberately NOT closed here — the single-user boot restore,
/// and the fact that `protected` is read from a CACHED roster that plex.tv may have moved on from.
/// Both are older than this rule, both are one owner decision about what to do with no network,
/// and the obvious fix for the first (gating boot on [`Session::active_profile_is_protected`]) is
/// worse than the bug: that predicate answers TRUE for an empty or unknown roster by design, so it
/// would put a PIN screen in front of every single-account user who has no PIN at all.
/// Automatically Sign In is the explicit opt-in that extends the single-user restore to a
/// multi-user roster, PIN included.

/// The previous profile's per-user PMS token also stays installed in the server registry. It has to

/// — which is the precise claim, since background pumps and those avatar requests do still consume
/// the retained client — and the only ways off the screen are choosing a tile (which re-points the

/// path: the QR sign-in. So before this existed the roster was learned exactly once, at sign-in,
/// and never again — which meant:
///
/// * an account signed in before shared servers shipped had `sources: []` forever, and every share
///   was invisible on every boot no matter how many times the app was relaunched (owner-reported,
///   2026-08-14: the libraries were there under the dev credential trigger and gone on a real
///   launch — the persisted roster on the device was an empty array);
/// * and a friend sharing a library TOMORROW would never appear either, because nobody signs in
///   again. A grant is not a one-time fact, so neither is discovery of it.
///
/// Best-effort and non-destructive: on any failure the persisted roster stays exactly as it was, so
/// a boot with plex.tv unreachable still browses whatever was already known. A successful refresh
/// replaces the credential cache with the authoritative granted roster. Fresh authenticated
/// admission selects the primary; secondary grants remain live on identity-verified or cached
/// endpoints. It preserves the current primary only when that endpoint was admitted; otherwise it
/// promotes the preferred admitted survivor so `current` cannot be stranded on cached metadata.
///
/// Persists only when the roster actually CHANGED, because the session file is on flash and a
/// rewrite per boot buys nothing.
///
/// **Its credential-bearing result is committed for the account OWNER only, and that is a
/// correctness gate rather than a policy.** The worker still probes on every stored boot so fresh,
/// credential-free reachability facts survive; the session owner rejects Activate/Install and the
/// Reconcile credential patch when [`Session::active_profile_is_admin`] is false.
/// The one credential this can ask plex.tv with is [`Session::account_token`], which belongs to the
/// admin and is never replaced by a Plex Home switch — so every `accessToken` in the answer is the
/// ADMIN's per-(user, server) grant. Installing those while a managed profile is watching swaps the
/// wrong identity's token into every registered `Client` in place (that swap is what the ~30 call
/// sites holding a `&'static Client` are built to follow) and then persists it: browsing and
/// scrobbling as the account owner from someone else's profile. For a RESTRICTED profile it is
/// worse than wrong, it is a re-grant — [`retoken`] had already blanked and hidden the servers that
/// profile was not given, and this puts them back.
///
/// Re-keying the answer for the active profile afterwards is not available: the switch keeps that
/// user's account token as [`UserRef::plex_tv_token`] in protected storage for account-service
/// reads such as the audio-language preference, but this function cannot make the live
/// `/api/v2/resources` round trip that produces per-server tokens. It therefore does not use the
/// stored credential to re-fetch or re-key the roster here. So the honest answer is to skip, and
/// the cost is named: a share granted while a managed profile is signed in appears when someone
/// next switches profile (the switch re-keys the whole roster from its own response) or signs in
