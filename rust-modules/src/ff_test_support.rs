// None on Darwin, so a test naming it would pass without executing one line of it), but the

// -- the AVIO callbacks under teardown -------------------------------------------------
//
// These drive `read_cb`/`seek_cb` directly, which works on the host precisely because neither
// one touches FFmpeg: they are plain `extern "C"` fns over an `AvioState`, whose every field
// (an HttpStream, an AuQueue, two CStrings, three integers) is ordinary Rust. So long as a
// test stays off `av_*`, the callbacks link and run here exactly as they do on the TV.

/// A loopback PMS stand-in that COUNTS both accepted connections and requests served — the
/// observables that matter, since "did the callback go back to the server" is the whole
/// question and no return value can answer it.
///
/// **Why two counters.** Sequential HLS/media GETs now reuse a keep-alive fd, so a new
/// request is no longer a new connection. The accept count still answers "did we dial",
/// which is what teardown and Range-seek tests care about (`seek_cb` still `http_close`s
/// first). libcurl keeps the connection in its multi handle's cache; HLS HTTPS now holds
/// that multi across playlist and segment URLs. The request count is what moves when reuse
/// works.
///
/// Each connection gets its own handler thread and is served keep-alive; the accept count is
/// bumped BEFORE the reply is written, so it is already final by the time any `http_open`
/// against this listener can return — every assertion below is causally ordered behind that,
/// and needs no sleep and no timing margin.
