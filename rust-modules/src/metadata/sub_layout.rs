//! **The Subtitles panel's row model** (plan `subtitle-menu-capsule` §3,
//! `/tmp/dsplayer/player.html:1104-1162`): which tracks are "yours", how they group by language,
//! in what order the sections and rows fall, and what each row MEANS — all pure over plain values
//! (the playing item's streams, the demuxer's own tags, "your languages"), so every rule here is
//! host-tested without a `PlaybackSession`, a store or a `TableView`.
//!
//! `appkit::track_menu` turns a [`sub_sections`] answer into a keyed form (labels, badges, the
//! checkmark, the Timing and Style read-outs) and reads a focused row back through
//! [`SubRow::target`]. The model deliberately carries no checked track, offset or tone: those are
//! read-outs, so changing one never re-groups the list.
//!
//! The shape: Off and every single-track "yours" language sit under one "Subtitles" header; a
//! "yours" language with several tracks gets its own section, ranked full < SDH < forced <
//! commentary; everything else is "Other languages", ONE row on the root (a drill-in; the page behind it is
//! [`SubModel::other`], one [`OtherLang`] per language, sorted by name); and a headerless section holds Timing and Style (both omitted
//! under transcode). "Yours" is the pref language (if the play resolved under
//! one), the playing audio's language, and the current subtitle's own language, in that order
//! (`route::cur_sub_pref_lang`, gathered by `screens::player::overlay`).
