//! mock's `parseTrackName` (`player.html:430-460`), which the design record settles as the
//! reference for the language-grouped Subtitles panel (`docs/../subtitle-menu-capsule` plan §1).
//!
//! A track's title from PMS mixes two different questions run together: what KIND of track it
//! is (a fixed, small vocabulary — FORCED, SDH, "full", a commentary track) and WHOSE it is (free
//! text: "iTunes", "DVD R5", "Е. Воронин"). The kind becomes a badge, or nothing at all when it
//! only restates that every unmarked track already is ("full"/"Полные"); what is left is the
//! SOURCE, and that is the detail line a Subtitles row draws under its language.
//!
//! Pure: strings and flags in, [`SubLabel`] out. No `metadata::Stream`, no `ui::` type — so it is
//! reachable from `screens::tracks_panel` (which never imports `ui::`) as well as
//! `appkit::track_menu` (which already names `crate::metadata`).

/// A track's kind, in the SINGLE priority a Subtitles-panel row cares about (rank, badge, and the
