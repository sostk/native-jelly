//! Which codepoints a font file can actually draw — read straight out of its `cmap`.
//!
//! Two callers, for the same reason. `text.rs` asks it per character to decide
//! which link of the fallback chain renders a run; the test module at the bottom of THIS file
//! asks it of the shipped `pkg/appfont*.ttf` and asserts a **declared codepoint set**, inside
//! `make check`, in milliseconds, with no television and no GL context.
//!
//! ## Why the gate exists
//!
//! `pkg/appfont.ttf` covers 2853 codepoints — Latin, Cyrillic, Greek — and **zero** Hangul, Kana
//! or Han. A Plex library with Korean, Japanese or Chinese titles rendered 100 % tofu, and every
//! test tier this project has was structurally blind to it: the host suite draws nothing, the
//! simulator renders through a different rasterizer, and the device FPS scenes grade `loop=`.
//! Coverage is not a rendering question at all — it is a property of a file on disk — so it
//! belongs in the cheapest tier, and this is it.
//!
//! The same defect class already shipped once, visibly: subtitle convention wraps a sung line in
//! U+2669–U+266C, Inter carries none of them, and a panel capture of the Family Guy theme read
//! `▯NO GLYPH▯ It seems today`. `tools/cut-inter.py` synthesizes those four; nothing asserted it
//! until now.
//!
//! ## Why the cmap and not `TTF_GlyphIsProvided`
//!
//! SDL2_ttf does expose a coverage query, and it is the wrong tool twice over. `TTF_GlyphIsProvided`
//! takes a **`Uint16`**, so it cannot be asked about anything above U+FFFF; and the 32-bit
//! `TTF_GlyphIsProvided32` is declared in the NDK's header, exported by the NDK's
//! `libSDL2_ttf-2.0.so.0.18.0`, and present on **none of the 14 firmware inventories** — the NDK is
//! 2.0.18 and every television ships 2.0.10 or 2.0.14
//! (`tools/fwcompat.py --lib libSDL2_ttf-2.0.so.0 --grep '32$'` returns zero matches on all 14).
//! It would therefore have compiled, linked and passed `make check`, then failed at the first
//! coverage query on every set. `text.rs`'s `extern` block carries the general form of that trap.
//!
//! Either one also needs an open `TTF_Font` — a size, a GL-adjacent init and a device — which is
//! precisely what a host gate must not need. Parsing the cmap answers the same question from the
//! file alone.
//!
//! ## What it reads
//!
//! Only the sfnt table directory and the `cmap` table, by seek — never the whole file. That
//! matters: `pkg/appfont-cjk.ttf` is 21 MB and its cmap is 233 KB. Unicode subtable formats 4, 6,
//! 12 and 13 are decoded and **unioned**; a mapping to glyph 0 is not coverage and is excluded,
//! which is the difference between "the cmap has an entry" and "the font can draw it".
