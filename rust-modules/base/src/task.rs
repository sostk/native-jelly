//! The thread seam: where work leaves the main thread ([`spawn`]), and what cannot follow it
//! ([`MainThread`]).
//!
//! `std::thread::spawn` **panics** when the OS refuses the thread — it unwraps `Builder::spawn`,
//! whose `Err` is `pthread_create`'s EAGAIN (glibc returns it when `allocate_stack` cannot `mmap`
//! the stack, or `clone(2)` hits `RLIMIT_NPROC`/`threads-max`). Almost every worker here is
//! started from the SDL loop, so that panic unwinds out of `nj_run` through the C shim and
//! takes the app down. It would also fail at the worst possible moment: the caller has just armed
//! an in-flight flag, so had the app survived, the screen would sit on a spinner that can never
//! resolve.
//!
//! **Measured on the target, not estimated** (`tools/threadprobe.c`, 2026-07-28, run under the
//! app's own uid — the first version of this note guessed and was wrong about which limit binds):
//!
//! | stack | refused at | binding limit |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 2 MB (the platform default) | **2043 threads** | `RLIMIT_AS` — the full AArch32 4 GB space |
//! | 256 KB (`spawn_small`) | **3745 threads** | `RLIMIT_NPROC`, which is 3746 |
//!
//! Both refusals are EAGAIN, exactly the error `spawn` unwraps. Against that, the app runs **31
//! threads at playback peak** (13 at Home) and peaks at 363 MB of `VmSize` — ~66x and ~11x
//! headroom. So this module is not fixing something that happens; it is refusing to let an
//! unreachable-but-unrecoverable branch exist, for the price of a return value.
//!
//! The table is also why [`SMALL_STACK`] is not a micro-optimisation: which limit you hit depends
//! on the stack size, and the crossover sits between these two values. A 2 MB stack spends address
//! space (the scarcer resource here at 1/2043 per thread); 256 KB spends a thread slot instead.
//!
//! Both entry points below report the refusal instead of panicking. Releasing the armed flag
//! stays with the caller — a latch is a property of the screen, not of the thread.
//!
//! **This is what step 3 of `docs/async-model-decision.md` became.** That step adopted a generic
//! `task::Job<T>` — generation guard, monotone one-slot mailbox, single-flight, cancel — to
//! replace the hand-rolled worker idiom. By the time its turn came, the idiom had already landed
//! by hand at five sites and been device-verified, so `Job` would have been a pure refactor of
//! working code; the re-evaluation declined it and is logged in the decision doc. What that
//! re-evaluation turned up instead is the divergence above: of the five copies of the idiom, only
//! two handled a refused spawn. The piece worth sharing was the spawn, not the mailbox.
//!
//! **This module is also the allowlist boundary of `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `threads` gate**
//! (restructure spec §15.2, phase 12): every `std::thread::spawn` call outside this file, in
//! production code, is a violation — checked file by file across the whole crate, with a
//! `#[cfg(test)] mod` block excluded (a unit test's own mock TCP/HTTP peer stands in for a real
//! peer and is not a worker). Verified 2026-09-10: it is already empty, i.e. every real worker
//! this crate spawns — the demux/media threads, `aq`, `stream`, `imgcache`, `ff`, `http`, `auth`,
//! `curlio`/`route::decision`, the Plex client/transcoder, `browse`, `player`, `nj_machine::present`,
//! `nj_machine::landgate` — already calls [`spawn`]/[`spawn_small`], not `std::thread::spawn` directly.
//! `ci/allow/threads.txt` is that gate's allowlist and it, too, is empty for the same reason; a
//! new production `thread::spawn` outside this file fails CI rather than waiting for a review.

///
/// It gates the two things in `player/` that were main-thread-confined by comment only:
///
/// * **the ACB/Starfish seam** — `player::ffi`'s wrappers. The raw `extern "C"` block is private
///   to that module, so the token is the only way in. Bind order (`setMediaId` → `LOADED` →
///   `setMediaVideoData` → `setDisplayWindow` → `PLAYING`) is a sequence of calls with no
///   locking behind it; a second thread stepping into the middle of it corrupts the sink.
/// * **the native session slot** — `App.adapters.player`. Until phase 9 that was
///   `player::engine::ENGINE`, a `static mut` handed out as `&'static mut` with worker threads
///   holding raw pointers into the boxes it owns: two live `&mut` to it is instant UB, and the
///   token was the only thing standing between the code and one. It is a FIELD now, so the token
///   is CONSUMED into `player::adapter::PlayerAdapter` and `&mut PlayerAdapter` is the
///   proof instead — one the borrow checker keeps rather than one a caller can satisfy twice.
///
/// The one deliberate hole: `assume` is callable, so `unsafe { MainThread::assume() }` inside a
/// worker would defeat this. That is the ceiling of the pattern, not an oversight — what it buys
/// is that the mistake has to be *written*, in an `unsafe` block, instead of happening by
