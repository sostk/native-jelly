//! The `/tmp` developer-trigger PRIMITIVES: the one door onto `/tmp/nativejelly-*`.
//!
//! This app is driven headlessly by ~44 files under `/tmp/nativejelly-*`: which screen to boot to,
//! which item to play, which URL to stream, whether to auto-press OK, which PMS token to use.
//! That is how `tests/run.py` and every capture scene work, and it is not going away. This module
//! is the READ side of that surface — [`flag`], [`read`], [`read_sample`], the per-process latch
//! [`latched_flag!`], and the handful of triggers whose answer is a plain value ([`no_wan`],
//! [`holdload_delay_ms`], [`guard_log_only`]). It names no application type, so every layer can
//! call it. What a trigger DOES once read — the arms that boot a screen, press a key, feed the
//! player a URL — is `dev` and its `scenarios`, which names the app and sits above
//! everything; a typed trigger (a value that needs an upper layer's type to parse into) lives next
//! to the one lower-layer module that consumes it, parsed from [`read`].
//!
//! It must not exist in a public build. `/tmp` is the SHARED system `/tmp` in the production jail
//! too (mode 1777, both jail profiles), so on an ordinary user's TV every one of those files is a
//! behaviour switch any co-resident process can throw. Three are outright takeovers:
//! `nativejelly-token` beats the signed-in session (`app.rs`'s boot gate), `nativejelly-servers` hands
//! the app a whole additional server — an address AND the token to trust it with — and
//! `nativejelly-url` replaces the stream the player feeds.
//!
//! So every read goes through here, and here is `#[cfg]`-gated on the `devtriggers` feature. In a
//! `--no-default-features` build [`flag`] is `false` and [`read`] is `None` at COMPILE time, so
//! no trigger can be armed. Storage and diagnostics still use runtime files; none are developer
//! triggers.
//!
//! That does NOT keep a trigger's NAME out of the binary. A branch behind `flag`/`read` usually
//! folds away, but not reliably: once the answer is carried through a struct field (the
//! `nobudget` flag on `DevFlags`), the optimizer may keep the branch and its string literals
//! in a release build, and `ci/check-package.py` fails the package because it greps the shipped
//! bytes for every trigger name `dev`'s `DIAG` list and [`CONTROLLED`] declare. So every
//! statement whose literal names a trigger (a log line saying `/tmp/nativejelly-…`) carries its own
//! `#[cfg(feature = "devtriggers")]`. Never rely on constant folding for this.
//!
//! **Never open a `/tmp` path directly.** The grep that audits this (`/tmp/nativejelly-` outside
//! `dev` and the unconditional log sinks, `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `tmppath`) is the only thing
//! keeping the property true. A trigger's bare name is the argument to [`flag`] / [`read`] and the
//! `nativejelly-` prefix is added in [`path`], so no literal path exists to find.

/// The triggers a CONTROLLED boot (`app::bootstrap`: the recorder, a replay, an explicit
/// `app-init`) may carry, as bare names. Anything else armed on a recording boot makes its typed
/// initial unsupported, so a replay cannot silently run under a trigger it never modelled.
