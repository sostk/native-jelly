//! The bounded diagnostic ring — **the log this app already writes, kept in memory**.
//!
//! There is no second logging system here and no new call site anywhere: `crate::eventlog::log` is the ONE
//! sink every diagnostic line in the app passes through, and this taps it one line below
//! `redact_tokens`. So the ring is by construction a strict subset of `nativejelly-events.log`, with
//! the shipped credential backstop already applied, and a module that starts logging tomorrow is
//! in the snapshot with no change here.
//!
//! # Two caps, not one
//!
//! A record count alone is not a bound: one `feed` line is ~40 bytes and one Load payload line can
//! be several hundred, so 4000 records is anywhere between 160 KB and megabytes. Both caps are
//! enforced on every insert and the older half of the ring is evicted until both hold. The device
//! declares a `requiredMemory` budget in `appinfo.json` and shares one `/tmp`-less jail with the
//! video pipeline; an unbounded debug buffer is exactly the sort of thing that turns a reproducible
//! bug into an unreproducible OOM.
//!
//! **Eviction is counted and reported.** `dropped` rides in the envelope, because "the window was
//! too small" and "nothing happened before the bug" are the same silence otherwise — and the whole
//! promise of this feature is that pressing the button after reproducing a fault still captures
//! what led to it.
//!
//! # Cost on the paths it sits on
//!
//! One `Mutex` lock, one `String` allocation and a `VecDeque::push_back` per logged line. The log
//! is written a few times a second at most and never per frame (`crate::eventlog::log`'s own note), and the
//! lock is never held across an I/O call: [`take`] clones the whole buffer out under the lock and
//! serialises outside it.
