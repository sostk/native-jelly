//! What we are actually drawing into — as opposed to what we asked for, or what the panel is.
//!
//! # Three different numbers, and picking the wrong one breaks a working television
//!
//! The UI is authored at a fixed **1920x1080 logical** canvas: every theme token, every layout
//! constant, every font size on the `theme::size` ladder is in those units, and the text/icon
//! crispness contract (`gfx::snap`) assumes 1:1 texels. That canvas is not going to change, and
//! it should not — see [`scale`] for why rendering at panel resolution is the wrong trade.
//!
//! What can change is the **drawable**: the pixel buffer GL renders into. Today it is 1920x1080
//! because that is what `SDL_CreateWindow` asks for and webOS grants, on a 4K panel that composites
//! the result up to 3840x2160 in hardware, for free. That is the right arrangement and this module
//! exists to keep it working, not to replace it.
//!
//! The trap is the third number. **`SDL_webOSGetPanelResolution` reports the PANEL** — 3840x2160
//! on a 2019 4K set whose UI surface is 1080p. It is present on every webOS release, which makes
//! it an inviting answer to "what resolution are we on", and it is the wrong one: sizing the UI
//! from it would render a 4K interface into a 1080p buffer on hardware that has run correctly for
//! the life of this project. It is logged here for diagnosis and used for nothing.
//!
//! # What this actually guards against
//!
//! `glViewport(0, 0, 1920, 1080)` on a drawable that is not 1920x1080 puts the entire interface in
//! the bottom-left corner of the screen. Nothing errors; the app runs; a quarter of the panel has
//! a UI on it. Since the app has never run on webOS 5+, whether a newer compositor grants exactly
//! the surface we request is an assumption — and it is a cheap one to stop making.
