//! Bind a TV library at RUNTIME instead of at link time, by SONAME candidate list.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Everything the app links names its library in `DT_NEEDED`, and the dynamic loader treats a
//! missing entry as fatal: the process dies at `exec()`, before `main`, before the event log is
//! open. That is exactly the failure a webOS 5 television gives today — `libAcbAPI.so.1` was
//! deleted at 5.0 and every FFmpeg SONAME moved a major — and it presents to the user as "the
//! app does nothing", with no log line to read and nothing to report.
//!
//! `DT_NEEDED` also cannot express "either of these". One binary cannot depend on
//! `libavformat.so.57` *and* `libavformat.so.58`; naming both means both must be present, which
//! is true on no firmware ever shipped. So a single binary that runs on both eras has to resolve
//! those libraries itself. That is all this module does.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! It is not a general dynamic-loading framework and it is not for libraries that exist
//! everywhere. `libSDL2`, `libGLESv2`, `libglib-2.0`, `libluna-service2`, `libwayland-client`,
//! `libplayerAPIs` and `libpf-1.0` are present with the same SONAME on every release from 4.4.2
//! through 11.2.0 (`tools/fwcompat.py --inventory` will show you), so they stay linked normally
//! and keep real link-time symbol checking. Moving a library here TRADES that checking away for
//! version tolerance, and is only worth it where the version actually varies.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! [`dynlib!`] takes a block shaped exactly like the `extern "C"` block it replaces and emits an
//! `unsafe fn` of the same name and signature for each entry, so call sites do not change. The
//! generated `load()` is all-or-nothing: it resolves every symbol or it
//! reports which are missing and leaves the table empty. Callers must gate on that result —
//! `ff::boot()` does, and `ff::demux()` refuses when it failed.
//!
//! Calling a wrapper whose symbol never resolved is a bug in that gating, not a recoverable
//! condition, so it logs the symbol name and panics rather than jumping through a null pointer.
//! The alternative — returning a per-signature sentinel — would let a missing symbol travel as a
//! plausible-looking value into the media pipeline, which is the harder failure to diagnose of
//! the two, on a device where diagnosis means reading a log over ssh.
