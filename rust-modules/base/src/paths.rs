//! Where the app's own files live — resolved at runtime, never hardcoded.
//!
//! webOS installs a native app under ONE of two prefixes, and which one is not ours to choose:
//!
//! | installed by | app dir | jail profile |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | LG Developer Mode (`ares-install`) | `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/<id>` | `jail_native_devmode.conf` |
//! | webOS Homebrew Channel | `/media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/<id>` | `jail_native.conf` |
//!
//! The two jails differ in what is WRITABLE, which is the part that bites:
//! `jail_native_devmode.conf` does `mount rw /media/developer` + `mount ro /media/internal`;
//! `jail_native.conf` does the opposite and contains no `/media/developer` at all. So a path that
//! is correct under one install is missing under the other.
//!
//! Both failures used to be silent. Hardcoded font paths fell through to the system DroidSans
//! while `init_text` still logged `ok=1` — the whole `theme::size` ladder rendered in a face with
//! no bold companion, so every bold rung became synthetic emboldening applied after grid-fitting.
//! The session file's `open` returned ENOENT into a best-effort `save()` that dropped it, so the
//! user re-did the QR sign-in on every boot with a fresh client id each time.
//!
//! `/proc/self/exe` is the answer, not `$HOME`: LG's own jail conf sets `HOME` **twice** (once to
//! `$APPDIR`, once to `/media/developer`) and which one survives differs between the two profiles.
//! `/proc` is `mount rw` in both, and read from inside the jail the link resolves jail-relative —
//! exactly the path the app must use. Kodi's `CPlatformWebOS::GetHomePath()` does the same thing.

/// POLICES a mismatch — the usual claim, and a plausible one — is a firmware behaviour nothing in
/// this repository can settle; `docs/two-installs.md` §6 keeps it on the device list rather than

///
///   * `pkg/plxnative` stays ONE artifact. Nothing about the flavour reaches codegen, so there is
///     no second `--target-dir`, no second stamp, and no way for `make deploy` to ship a binary

/// on the theory that a future layout may make it writable; the legacy in-app-dir path comes next
/// and is read-only in practice (migration).
///

/// above, and that order is load-bearing.** A 2026-09-20 report from an unrooted webOS 4.4.3 set

/// candidate path` — none of `/media/developer`, `/media/internal` or the app dir accepted the
/// write on that jail. But the app's own event log was reaching
/// `/tmp/<app id>/plxnative-events.log` on that same television: `/tmp` is `mount rw, mode 1777`
/// in both jail profiles and the per-install runtime root under it is app-owned (see
/// [`runtime_dir`]), so it is the one thing this jail class guarantees is writable. It is offered
/// last, never first, because `/tmp` is swept on reboot — a save that lands only here is NOT
/// durable, and every candidate ahead of it that DOES survive a reboot must keep winning exactly
