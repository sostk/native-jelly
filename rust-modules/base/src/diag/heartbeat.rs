//! `Instruments` — the frame's own measurement (restructure spec §8.4): the eight phase stamps
//! over the frame algorithm's steps, the per-second `worstframe=`/`worstprep=` peaks the heartbeat
//! carries, and the `FRAMEDROP` line. Lifted out of `app/run.rs` in phase 2 so the loop reads as
//! its algorithm and the instrument is one value with one owner (`App.instr`).
//!
//! The wire formats are the harness's contract (`tests/run.py`: `FRAMEDROP_RE`, `WORST_RE`,
//! `FPS_RE`) and are byte-identical to what the loop wrote before this module existed: the
//! FRAMEDROP fields in the spec's order (ingest results tick_drain navcommit prepare draw capture
//! swap), `worstframe=` LAST of the graded fields on the heartbeat. Phase 11 added the rest of
//! §8.4: `coldopen` (its own line, once per screen mount, UNARMED), and `carried=`/`dropped=`/
//! `budget=`/`evicted_hot=` after `worstprep=` — see [`Instruments::heartbeat_tail`] for the wire
//! order and why nothing may be inserted ahead of `fps=` or `worstframe=`.
//!
//! Phase timing and present-to-present pacing are armed, and the split is the measurement's
//! cost: the eight phases and the two peaks need a clock read per phase, so they hide behind
//! `nativejelly-framedrop`; every other field is a counter somebody already keeps, so it prints in
//! every build. The one §8.4 names and this module does NOT have is `allocs=` — see
//! `heartbeat_tail`'s doc for why a counting allocator was not invented to fill it.
//!
//! Armed by `nativejelly-framedrop[=<ms>]`; unarmed, every stamp is the frame's origin and every
//! phase reads 0.0 — the counter is never read, so an unarmed frame pays nothing.

/// **`coldopen screen=<name> ms=<n> prepared=<bool>`, once per mount, on every build.**
///
/// The definition, which is the whole of it:
///
/// * the clock starts on the frame that executed `Fx::Mount` for that body — `Dispatcher::mount`,
///   the same event `FrameReport::mounted` reports;
/// * it stops on the FIRST frame that body both PREPARED and DREW. A body that mounts and is
///   unmounted without ever drawing produces no line at all, and its pending record is dropped
///   when the unmount lands;
/// * `ms` is the difference of those two frames' tick clocks. A mount and a first draw in ONE
///   iteration is `ms=0`, and that is the honest reading: the instrument measures how long a
///   screen took to get on screen, not how long the frame it landed in took (`worstframe=` and
///   `FRAMEDROP` are that);
/// * `prepared` is whether the frame it drew on refused NOTHING it asked for — the `Budget`'s
///   refusal count taken at the opening of that frame's prepare window and read again at the
///   draw. It is the frame's verdict rather than the screen's, deliberately: the budget admits
///   per CLASS across the whole frame, so "did this screen get everything" is not a question the
///   budget can answer and pretending otherwise would put a per-screen word on a per-frame fact.
///
/// It is UNARMED — no trigger, no threshold — because it is one line per screen mount, and the
/// scene it re-bases (`cold-open`) could not be graded from `FRAMEDROP` without censoring itself:
/// the detector only prints above the threshold `tests/run.py` armed it with, so every cold open
/// FASTER than the ceiling left no line, and a run of them was graded as passes with no samples
/// at all (`tests/run.py::grade_frame_ceilings`, and the "no-line PASS, 208.5, no-line PASS"
/// reading in `docs/measurements/tv-session-5-2026-09-10.md`).
///
/// **One route is structurally invisible to it: the player.** Its page still answers
/// `FocusSource::Legacy`, so `bridge::page_owned` is false there and the loop draws that page
/// itself rather than through `Dispatcher::draw_with` — the pending record is never matched and
/// no line is emitted. That ends when the player's focus moves onto the engine; nothing else is
/// needed here.
