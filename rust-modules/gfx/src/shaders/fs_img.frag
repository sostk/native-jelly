// The tile texture shader is the whole CARD COMPOSITE - texture + the 1px focus edge-sheen
// (u_rimw/u_rimcol) + a soft drop-shadow (u_card/u_shinv/u_shcol) - all in ONE pass.
// Perf (Mali-T820, per the perf review): (1) an INTERIOR EARLY-OUT - ~85% of a card's fragments
// are strictly inside the rounded rect (d < -2) where rim/AA/shadow are all zero, so they skip the
// 4 smoothsteps; on this per-thread tiler the branch genuinely saves the ALU. (2) UV remap +
// card-local p are interpolated varyings, not per-fragment math (see vs_img.vert). (3) the
// uniform-only terms (u_card's corner coordinates and interior cutoff, u_shinv = 0.5/blur) are folded on the CPU
// (Midgard has no uniform pre-shader). (4) the 1px rim is a single-op triangle - and its width
// must stay <=1px: the triangle hits exactly 0 at d=-2, which is what makes the d<-2 early-out
// seamless (a wider rim would be hard-cut there). The shadow sh = smoothstep(clamp(0.5 -
// d/(2*blur))) is algebraically identical to 1 - smoothstep(-blur, blur, d). rgb = tex*m
// premultiplies coverage (so a rounded texture's ~1px AA edge is very slightly darker under
// straight-alpha blend - accepted). Full-screen art (radius 0) takes the flat fast-path.
// v_cuv/v_p and the SDF chain are highp - see the PRECISION note in fs_src.frag.
//
// NJ_FOCUS (linked as its own program, gfx.rs's FOCUS_IMAGE/VS_FOCUS/FS_FOCUS): the lit-glass
// edge and risen shadow for a FOCUSED ArtTile used to be inline here unconditionally, behind
// `u_focus.x > 0.0` uniform branches. A TV A/B measured real backpressure from that: EVERY IPROG
// draw (every resting card, glyph, blur reduction, `field_kick`, `FrameCache` quad) paid for the
// bigger program even with nothing focused - Midgard flattens the extra uniform branches into
// selects, and the `v_gloss` varying load costs something on every fragment regardless of
// `u_focus.x`. The plain (non-`NJ_FOCUS`) path below is therefore BYTE-FOR-BYTE the pre-focus
// program (main's `fs_img.frag` at 78a823eea, comments aside): `IPROG`, `FS_STILL` and every
// resting-card draw compile and run exactly that, unaffected by any of this file's FOCUS code.
// `gfx::draw_tex_impl` only reaches for the `NJ_FOCUS` program when a draw is actually focused or
// risen (`focus > 0.0 || dy > 0.0` - at most one card on screen), falling back to the plain
// program if it fails to link.
//
// FOCUS (ArtTile, theme.rs's CARD_GLOW_*/CARD_GLARE_*/CARD_GLOSS_* constants document these same
// numbers - GLSL has no way to read a Rust const, so the numbers below are literals and
// `image_focus_geometry_matches_the_shader_literals` in gfx.rs pins the two together): `u_focus.x`
// is the caller's pop factor f (0 at rest), the SAME value for every fragment of one draw call, so
// every `u_focus.x > 0.0` branch below is a uniform branch. Three additive layers, white only:
// (1) RIM, an inward glow that follows the TRUE rounded outline (a plain box distance is only
// correct on the straight segments - a circle's corner distance is `length(q)`, not `max(q.x,q.y)`,
// and CSS inset box-shadow itself follows `border-radius`): the base band (.08, 12px) and the
// brighter-top (.12, 6px)/fainter-bottom (.06, 4px) bands are all `clamp(1 + d/px, 0, 1)` against
// the SAME `d` the SDF/rim/shadow already compute, so there is no second distance field - only extra
// `clamp`s once `d` is known. The top/bottom bands are further weighted by `vp.y` so they read as
// "this edge", not "near any edge": full weight hugging the top/bottom straight run, fading toward
// the sides and following the corner's own falloff through `d`, which is what makes it look the same
// on a circle as on a rounded rect. (2) GLARE, the top tab bar's own glass crown: the 1px perimeter
// sheen is lifted from u_rimcol.a towards CARD_GLARE_A (0.45, brighter than the design system's
// GLASS_RIM_LIGHT .28 - a hairline over bright artwork needs more contrast than one over the dark
// glass track GLASS_RIM_LIGHT was tuned for) for the top 12px, easing back to the plain sheen by 16%
// of the tile height (CARD_GLARE_EASE, which keeps the glare on the crown only rather than running
// down the sides) - folded into the existing `rim` term, no extra SDF. (3) GLOSS, a
// linear-gradient(160deg, white .14 0%, transparent 34%) over the face from the top-left corner -
// AFFINE in position, so `vs_img.vert` computes it once per vertex as `v_gloss` and this file only
// ever reads the interpolated result, never re-derives it (`u_focus.y`, 1/gradient-length, is the
// one CPU-folded term the vertex shader also needs). Because gloss is free, both fast-exit branches
// below (the box-interior one and the post-`d` one) apply it directly and return - only the ≤12px
// true border band still takes the full SDF/RIM/GLARE/shadow path, and its own combined
// `glow`/`gloss` mix is ONE `clamp`ped mix, not two sequential ones - that IS the algebra, not a
// style choice. `wide`/`wide2` are each a single box-distance compare: the top 6px/bottom 4px glare
// bands used to widen them too, but both are provably already covered by `edge < 12.0` (the
// top/bottom distances are each >= the box `edge`, so a narrower band's own cutoff can never fire
// outside it), and the gloss cutoff needs nothing wider now that the cheap gloss mix runs at the
// exit itself.
//
// SHADOW: a resting/plain-image draw's shadow is the ordinary symmetric penumbra, `sh` evaluated
// against the same `d` as the rim/AA above (a card sitting close to its shelf reads fine as a soft,
// even glow). A FOCUSED card instead reads as RISEN, its shadow falling below it rather than sitting
// evenly around it. The shift is not a second SDF query point subtracted from `v_p`:
// `gfx::draw_tex_impl` inflates the FOCUSED quad ASYMMETRICALLY (more room below than above - see
// its own comment), which moves the QUAD's centre `dy` px below the CARD's true centre by
// construction, so raw `v_p` (quad-centred, as `vs_img.vert` has always defined it) already IS the
// shadow's own coordinate with no correction at all - `dShadow` reads it directly. The CARD's own
// shape (`q`/`straight`/`d`/glow/glare/gloss), which still needs the TRUE card-centred coordinate,
// applies the opposite correction instead: `vp = v_p + (0, u_focus.z)`. A fragment whose shadow is
// definitely past its own falloff (checked with a cheap box-distance proxy, no second `length()`)
// AND whose card contribution is definitely zero exits fully transparent before any of this runs -
// `discard` is expensive on Mali, so this writes `vec4(0)` and returns instead.
