// THE WASH WITH ITS PHOTOGRAPH DISSOLVED INTO IT, in one opaque pass: what `fs_ambient.frag` and
// then `fs_img.frag`'s plain path blended over it produce, for the pixels where the two overlap.
//
// Home's snap dive fades the hero photograph by (1 - snap) while sliding it up, and Detail's scroll
// fades its still the same way, so for the whole of either motion the panel under the art is the
// opaque wash AND the translucent photograph — two full passes over the same pixels. On the dev
// television (Mali-T820, 2026-09-28) that second pass is the frame's excess: the poster dive ran
// 17-24 ms a frame across its whole curve, and drawing the wash only where the art is NOT took it
// to 59.9 moving fps with no frame over 18 ms (`gfx::draw_art_wash` has the numbers). The frame is
// arithmetic-bound, so the pass has to go, not get cheaper: here the wash is evaluated where the
// art already is, and one fragment does the work of two.
//
// The wash is opaque, so the layered result — wash, then the art, then the screen's atmospheric
// ramp of scrim ink over both (`gfx::draw_ambient_inked` has the ramp's half) — is exactly
//
//   dst' = mix(mix(wash, art * tint.rgb, art.a * tint.a), ink, ramp)
//
// and the wash takes its noise BEFORE the photograph is laid over it, as it did as a layer. What
// differs is 8-bit rounding: one quantisation where the layers made three.
//
// Pairs with vs_ambient.vert built with NJ_ART_WASH (and NJ_DITHER_NC): v_col IS the wash's
// per-vertex field over the same mesh, and v_cuv the art quad's own texture coordinate.
