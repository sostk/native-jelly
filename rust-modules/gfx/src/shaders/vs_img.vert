// Card-composite vertex shader (pairs with fs_img.frag - and with fs_blur.frag, which reads only
// v_cuv). Hoists the two per-fragment affine terms to interpolated varyings (correct - both are
// affine in a_pos): v_cuv = the texture UV the quad samples, v_p = card-local pixel coords for
// the SDF.
//
// u_uvrect is (offset.xy, scale.zw) - the sub-rect of the SOURCE this quad maps to, as one mad.
// It was a bare `u_uvscale` centred on 0.5 (quad/card size, for the shadow inflation), which is
// the special case offset = 0.5 - 0.5*scale and is CPU-folded as such. It carries an offset now
// because `gfx::draw_blur_backdrop` samples an arbitrary screen-space window of the blur snapshot,
// and a scale about the centre cannot express one. A NEGATIVE scale.w is legal and load-bearing:
// that is how a bottom-up render target (every FBO chain here) is sampled the right way up.
//
// NJ_FOCUS (linked as its own program - see fs_img.frag's own NJ_FOCUS note): v_gloss hoists the
// GLOSS projection here because it is AFFINE in `a_pos` (a `linear-gradient` scalar), same
// reasoning as v_cuv/v_p - computed once per vertex and interpolated for free by the rasterizer
// instead of every fragment paying two `mad`s and a multiply. This is why the extra uniforms and
// varying live behind the SAME macro as fs_img.frag's focus code, rather than always being
// declared: every draw through the plain (non-`NJ_FOCUS`) program - every resting card, glyph,
// blur reduction, `field_kick`, `FrameCache` quad - stays the exact smaller program main shipped
// before this feature, with no v_gloss load and no extra uniform to fetch, which is the entire
// point of splitting the program in two. `u_focus.z` is the risen shadow's downward shift `dy` (0
// unless this card is focused) - the CARD's own coordinate is `v_p.y + u_focus.z`, never raw
// `v_p.y`, matching the fragment shader's own `vp` correction exactly, so the gloss reads from the
// card's TRUE centre even though the quad's own centre (what `v_p` is relative to) sits `dy` px
// above it once the shadow's asymmetric padding is in play (see gfx.rs's `draw_tex_impl`).
