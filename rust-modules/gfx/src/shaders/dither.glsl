// THE SHARED OUTPUT DITHER — prepended to every program that writes a SLOW GRADIENT over a BROAD
// area (`gfx::glsl_dithered!`). One tile, one uniform pair, one policy, one cost discipline.
//
// WHY IT IS SHARED. An 8-bit framebuffer quantises, and a gradient whose whole range is a handful
// of codes therefore comes out as a staircase of flat plateaus rather than a ramp. Measured on the
// television 2026-09-02, Settings over Home: a column through the modal ground spans luma 55.7 to
// 59.1 over 700 rows and contains FOUR distinct levels, in treads of 158, 157 and 146 rows. That is
// not subtle — it is three horizontal lines across the picture. `fs_ambient.frag` solved this for
// the page wash in 2026-09, at some cost, and every other slow gradient in the app kept its own
// answer or none: `fs_src.frag`'s vertical fill had nothing, `fs_modal_ground.frag` had nothing,
// `fs_shadow.frag`'s penumbra had nothing, and `fs_glass.frag` — the popover background this was
// reported against — had a hash that was both structured AND unconditional. Five programs, four
// answers. This file is the one answer — for the three programs whose ramp is a slow FIELD:
// `fs_ambient.frag`, `fs_field.frag`, `fs_glass.frag` (`fs_field.frag`, the underlay field, took
// the slot of `fs_modal_ground.frag` when that dead chain was deleted, 2026-09-19).
// `fs_src.frag` and `fs_shadow.frag`
// carried it too for two days and were taken back off on 2026-09-04: rule 1 below makes the branch
// cheap, not free, and on the two programs behind every rect and every card shadow it measured
// +4M shader words a frame on hero paging with every ramp test answering 0 — the whole of a 57→50
// fps regression. A rect's two-stop fill crosses tens of codes over hundreds of pixels; nobody has
// seen a tread on one. `gfx::glsl_dithered!`'s doc and its shader test pin both lists.
//
// IT IS NOT A PRECISION PROBLEM, and reaching for `highp` is the expensive wrong turn. An fp16
// interpolant across a 1920px quad steps by about 1/1000 of the quad, i.e. a colour error far under
// one 8-bit quantum; promoting a mix to fp32 changes nothing you can see and, measured with
// the HWCNT vinstr profiler, priced the hero's corner scrim at ~4.5 arithmetic words a fragment — 3.2M
// cycles of an 11.7M-cycle frame. Banding is an OUTPUT-QUANTISATION problem. The cure is noise at
// the output, not more bits in the middle. (`fs_src.frag`'s own PRECISION note is about something
// else entirely — pixel COORDINATES feeding an SDF, where fp16 really does dash a 1px edge.)
//
// THE FOUR COST RULES, all of them measured and all of them load-bearing:
//
//  1. **No branch; OFF is a different PROGRAM.** The first version of the ambient dither ran
//     unconditionally and multiplied by zero — but it did so behind the hash and the fp32 multiply
//     rule 4 removed: 5.3M of a 13.8M-cycle Home frame, and hero paging fell to 46 fps. A uniform
//     `if (u_dither > 0.0)` replaced it and was believed near-free; it is not. On the two per-rect
//     programs it measured +4M shader words a frame with every draw answering 0 (2026-09-04), and
//     on a scrolling Library the branch alone was +5.8M arithmetic words a frame, 49 fps against 59
//     with the same fetch unguarded (2026-09-19, the HWCNT vinstr profiler). So the helpers below are
//     straight-line, and the one broad surface that must NOT dither — the hero scrim over
//     artwork — is a plain twin program (`gfx::ambient_program`, `dither_stub.glsl`). A field under
//     `gfx::dither_for_field`'s threshold pays one idle-pipe fetch times 0. Only the three
//     slow-field programs carry this prelude at all.
//  2. **A TEXTURE FETCH, never a hash.** `fract(sin(dot(p,k))*43758.5)` is a range reduction plus a
//     polynomial on this part — about 7 arithmetic words. The arithmetic pipe is what binds a broad
//     quad here; the texture pipe beside it is idle. An interleaved-gradient hash was tried as the
//     middle ground and still cost the full-screen wash ~2 cycles a pixel.
//  3. **A 256-square tile, and the 256 was measured.** A tile is a PERIODIC signal and the eye finds
//     periodic structure far below the contrast at which it resolves the grain making it up. At 64
//     the repeat showed on a captured panel as a 30-across plaid (autocorrelation +0.570 at
//     horizontal lag 64 against +0.13 either side). `gfx::NOISE_DIM` is the number and `gfx.rs`'s
//     shader test pins it to the vertex shaders' divisor.
//  4. **No arithmetic on `gl_FragCoord`.** It is highp, so `gl_FragCoord.xy * (1.0 / 256.0)` — the
//     one multiply this prelude used to do — ran in fp32 on every fragment of every dithered
//     surface, and on a full-screen wash that multiply WAS the dither's cost: a scrolling Library
//     measured 45 fps with it and 60 without, dithered either way (2026-09-19, `tests/run.py --fps`,
//     `docs/backdrop-blur-profiling.md`). The tile coordinate is linear in screen position, so the
//     paired vertex shader computes it (`#define NJ_DITHER_NC`, `gfx::VS_*_DITHERED`) and the
//     fetch reads the varying directly: no arithmetic word at all before the fetch.
//
// THE NOISE IS TPDF AT ±1 LSB and both halves live in the TILE (`gfx::noise_tex`): the texel stores
// the mean of two independent full-avalanche hashes, so the expression here is exactly the one a
// ±½ LSB uniform dither would use and the whole difference is the amplitude the caller passes.
// Triangular is not less contour than uniform — it is marginally more absolute error — it removes
// noise MODULATION, the slow breathing/blotching that a signal-dependent error variance reads as.
//
// THE TILE IS BOUND ON TEXTURE UNIT 2, permanently, from `gfx::init`. Unit 0 is every program's own
// texture and unit 1 is `fs_glass.frag`'s sharp source, so 2 is the first free one; binding it once
// for the life of the process means no program pays a bind, and `glActiveTexture` never moves off
// unit 0 on the drawing path.
//
// WHO SETS `u_dither` IS A CPU DECISION — `gfx::dither_for_field`, the one policy — because the
// question is one only the caller can answer: is the field broad enough for a plateau to be
// findable. MOTION IS NOT PART OF IT, for any surface here, and the app has now made the opposite
// mistake three times. A focus spring on Settings must not strip the ground's noise: it did, for one day
// (2026-09-04), and the bands flickered in and out with every animation. Nor may the page's own
// verdict strip a WASH's: it did, until 2026-09-19, and since `AmbientWash::step` drives twelve
// corner springs the wash undithered itself for the whole of its own colour dissolve. Nor may the
// ARTWORK's motion: Home's and Detail's washes dropped the noise while a photograph slid over them
// until 2026-09-19 (`gfx::page_wash_dither`, now deleted), and the band of wash below Home's diving
// hero — wash-only, nothing over it — banded for the length of the dive. Every page wash dithers
// on every frame (`gfx::draw_ambient` takes no flag); rules 1 and 4 are what made that affordable.
