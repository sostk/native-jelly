//! Draw-class OVERDRAW ledger and draw-class MASK — the attribution instrument for the 88.6% of
//! the frame that is not the glass.
//!
//! `docs/backdrop-blur-profiling.md` established that the whole frame rasterizes **3.65 quads per
//! screen pixel** and that the glass is only 11.4% of it. That number came from the GPU's global
//! `FRAG_QUADS_RAST`, which cannot say *whose* quads they are: the wayland compositor draws into
//! the same counters, and one full-screen composite is a quarter of the budget on its own. This
//! module answers the two questions that follow, and neither of them needs a GPU counter:
//!
//! 1. **What does the APP submit?** [`gate`] sums, per draw class, the screen-visible area of every
//!    quad the app actually issues, on the CPU, exactly. `/tmp/nativejelly-overdraw` arms it and it
//!    logs one `OVERDRAW` line a second. This is immune to the two traps that make per-phase HWCNT
//!    cycle counts a bad budget — it is not `glFinish`-serialised and it cannot be billed for
//!    another process's work.
//! 2. **What does a class COST?** `/tmp/nativejelly-drawmask=<classes>` refuses every draw of the
//!    named classes, so a whole-frame `frame.ui` HWCNT A/B against the unmasked control prices that
//!    class *as the frame sees it*, un-serialised. `drawmask=all` draws nothing at all and is
//!    therefore the **compositor floor**: whatever `frame.ui` still costs with an empty page is
//!    work this app cannot remove.
//!
//! A masked leg is deliberately a BROKEN PICTURE. This is a measurement knob, not a feature — the
//! mask exists so a control-leg difference can be taken, and every leg it produces except the
//! control is unshippable by construction.
//!
//! Both surfaces are dev-only: with `devtriggers` off, [`gate`] is `false` and [`note_px`] is empty
//! at compile time, so a release binary carries neither the branch nor the counters.
