// ============================== backdrop blur ================================
// The frosted ground under a popover panel: a blurred snapshot of what the frame had drawn BEHIND
// it, sampled through the panel's own rounded rect. `track_menu.rs` carried "no true backdrop blur
// on the GLES plane" as a standing assumption for a year; this is what replaces it.
//
// Four facts shape the whole design.
//
// 1. **Snapshots are cached.** A popover over a still page captures on open and then costs one
//    textured quad per drawn frame. A surface over a MOVING page opts into
//    `widgets::Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP`; the frame's layer/region mechanism refreshes its
//    source on every changed present and otherwise reuses it.
// 2. **The capture is MID-FRAME.** `Painter`'s primitives are immediate GL calls, so the default
//    framebuffer already holds exactly the prepared page with its page-drawn overlay scrim
//    at the moment the panel is about to draw.
//    That is the only reason no render-target restructuring is needed: the "background" is a
//    definition of *when*, not of *what*.
//    **A tested and REJECTED hypothesis lives here**, recorded because it is the obvious next idea
//    and it is wrong on this part: that a mid-frame framebuffer read is expensive *because it is
//    mid-frame* — a tiler must resolve the frame's deferred passes before the copy can see them,
//    so moving the snapshot beside `capture::tick` (after the last draw, where the swap pays that
//    flush anyway) should have been free. Built and measured on the dev set: **48.1 ms deferred vs
//    45.3 ms mid-frame** — no difference, so the position costs nothing and the simpler code is the
//    one to keep. The cost is elsewhere; see the measurements on [`blur_snapshot`].
// 3. **Passes are a large part of the budget.** Two exact-2x reductions, two quarter-size Kawase
//    passes and one half-size up-filter make five render passes. Region limiting cuts their
//    fragments, but it does not make a small glass ornament free. The blur radius comes mostly
//    from the downsample rather than from kernel width; `fs_blur.frag` argues the tap count.
//    **Those figures are the 1:1 television**; every size here is derived from
//    `surface::viewport()` at first use, not written down. The simulator found out why within an
//    hour of this landing: its drawable is HALF the authored canvas, and a chain hard-coded to
//    1920x1080 grabbed a rect that does not exist, then sampled a UV window that mapped to no part
//    of the screen. On a 1:1 surface both bugs are invisible — which is the whole class of thing
//    the desktop simulator is for. The chain is built once because the drawable never changes
//    after `surface::probe` (no resize on either platform); a surface that could would owe this an
//    invalidation.
// 4. **Every Midgard trap the capture chain documents applies here**, because it is the same
//    machinery: NPOT targets REQUIRE CLAMP_TO_EDGE + LINEAR (core ES2 samples them opaque black
//    under the defaults, with no GL error), `glClear` before each pass spares the tile
//    preserve-load, and RGBA FBO renderability is implementation-defined so completeness is
//    checked and the feature LATCHES OFF rather than crashing. A latched-off blur draws nothing at
//    all and the panel keeps its own opaque ground — the fallback is the old look, not a hole.
//
// Deliberately NOT used by the player's panels (track/chapters/info/overflow). There the frame
// behind the popover is mostly alpha-0 punch-through to the hardware video plane, which GL cannot
// read: blurring it would smear transparency, not video. `docs/` and the player HUD's own notes
// say why that plane is unreachable; nothing here changes it.

/// How many exact halvings the CAPTURE path takes before the blur taps — and it is not a knob. It
/// is [`BLUR_DIRECT_SCALE`] written as a count of halvings, asserted below.
///
/// **One material, two paths.** The direct path renders the page at 1/4; the capture path has to
/// arrive at the same place. They publish into one snapshot and one shader samples it, and which
/// path served a given surface is not a property of its material: an independent band uses
/// the direct prefix, while a band over lower glass captures that glass's visible composite.
/// The source scale belongs to the material, not to a path — a surface whose blur depends on who took the snapshot
/// is not a material at all.
///
/// **They drifted, and closing that is what this constant is for.** It went 2 -> 1 the day after the
/// direct path became the shipping one, in a commit whose subject and every measurement was the tab
/// BAR — which by then rendered its own source at 1/4 and did not read this at all. What it actually
/// changed was every CACHED popover: a half-resolution source, tap offsets that are in TEXELS and so
/// halved with it, and no up-filter at all, because the up pass was gated on `BLUR_REDUCTIONS >= 2`.
/// That is not a lighter blur. It is a 2x bilinear magnification of a half-res image with the
/// reconstruction pass switched off, and it reads as exactly what it is — measured on the
/// `checker:24` ground with the item menu over it, the pattern came through the panel as a lattice
/// of dots, and through the direct path's chain, same frame and same shader, it is gone.
///
/// Why 1/4 is the matched sampling rate for this kernel is on [`BLUR_DIRECT_SCALE`]. STRUCTURE —

/// * it destroys 14–16% of the lens's own horizontal signal in exactly the band the lens works in,
///   where the lit side costs 0.00%;
/// * it weakens the container's own bottom rim against the ground from 138% to 88% Weber — visible
///   as the rim closing the capsule with the shade off and dissolving along the lower right with it
///   on, which is the opposite of what an edge treatment is for;
/// * and it is anti-adaptive: 15.5 retinal codes on a bright ground where the boundary already
///   steps 46, and 6.2 on the dark page where the container has nothing else.
///
/// **Do not re-derive this from the macOS reference.** A real system container has no chamfer at
/// all — one transitional pixel, then dead flat — and it can afford that because its material ADDS
/// light: measured on the floating tab bar over a near-black page, .071 → .098, i.e. +38% Weber and
/// *lighter* than the page. A black scrim cannot do that. Ours over the same kind of ground is

/// the band of wash below Home's diving hero undithered for the whole dive. Every time the owner
/// saw the same thing: bands that appear while something moves and vanish when it stops.
///
/// **And no dither on a RECT at all.** Until 2026-09-04 `fs_src` and `fs_shadow` carried the
/// prelude too, behind a per-draw ramp test (`dither_for_ramp`: slow enough, broad enough, a
/// container rather than a page field). The test answered 0 for nearly every draw — and the draws
/// still paid, because the branch it gated was resolved per draw on Midgard but not for free: the
/// hero paging scene measured +4M shader words a frame with the prelude on those two programs
/// against without, the whole of a 57→50 fps regression, on frames where every ramp test had
/// answered 0. A rect's ramp is a scrim or a two-stop fill, crossing tens of codes over hundreds
/// of pixels, and nobody had reported a tread on one; the fields that DID band (the wash, the
/// glass blur, and the modal ground whose program slot the underlay field now holds) are exactly

// ============================== UI self-capture ==============================
// GL side of the dev capture stream (crate::capture): grab our own back buffer,
// GPU-downscale it, and read the small result back — the fast path the external
// ~200ms/frame capture service can't offer. UI plane ONLY: glReadPixels cannot
// see the hardware video overlay plane (that's composited by the TV, outside our
// context). Design per the verified plan (2026-07-22 workflow):
//
// - TWO chains (parity ping-pong): the chain written this capture is never the
//   chain in flight from the last one — kills Mali's CopyTex-into-referenced-
//   texture ghosting AND lets us read a chain rendered >=1 capture-cycle (>=33ms)
//   ago, so the read degenerates to a driver memcpy instead of the 155ms
//   window-surface pipeline drain we measured.
// - Downscale is exact-2x per pass (2x bilinear == 2x2 box): 1920x1080 -> mid
//   960x540 -> out 480x270. A single 4x pass would sample only 2x2 of each 4x4
//   block -> text shimmer. Both output sizes are always allocated; the requested
//   size only selects which FBO is the pass target (no realloc on switch, no
//   size races — dims are latched per chain at write time).
// - All six textures are NPOT: CLAMP_TO_EDGE + LINEAR are REQUIRED at creation
//   (core ES2 samples an NPOT texture as opaque black under the REPEAT +
//   NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR defaults — no GL error, just black), and mipmaps are
//   illegal. GL_RGBA unsized everywhere (GL_RGBA8 is not a valid ES2 token).
// - RGBA-texture FBO renderability is implementation-defined in core ES2, so
//   completeness is checked; on failure capture latches off (logged) rather than
//   crashing. Midgard exposes OES_rgb8_rgba8 in practice.
// - Y orientation: every full-quad IPROG pass flips row order once (vs_img does
//   gl_Position.y = -ndc.y with v_cuv = a_pos), glReadPixels is bottom-up memory
//   order (NOT a flip). CopyTexSubImage leaves cap_tex bottom-up; 1 pass (960 out)
//   -> top-down (correct); 2 passes (480 out) -> bottom-up again. The per-frame
//   `flip` flag tells the encoder to walk rows in reverse. No CPU flip cost — the
//   RGBA->RGB strip touches every row anyway.
// Main-thread only (like all gfx state).

// ============================== The UNDERLAY FIELD ==============================
// A COARSE COLOUR FIELD OF WHATEVER IS RENDERED BENEATH AN OVERLAY — the GL half. The CPU half
// (low-pass, grade, reconstruct, upload) is `ui::underlay`, and the reason the split falls here is
// that everything below this line needs a context and everything above that line is arithmetic a
// host test can grade.
//
// WHY A CHAIN AND NOT FOUR `glReadPixels` TAPS. The four-corner sampler this replaced (PR2 stage B,
// 2026-09-19; it read four 49x49 squares and handed back a four-corner envelope) hands back a
// bilinear gradient with four degrees of freedom, so it cannot say "the green is on the LEFT of the
// bottom edge and the red on the right". 120 cells can, and they cost one read instead of four —
// 480 bytes against 4 x 9.6 kB, all of it produced by the GPU's own filter rather than by averaging
// 2401 samples per corner on the CPU.
//
// WHY EXACT 2x PASSES. Bilinear minification is a clean 2x2 box at exactly 2x and nothing else
// (see `blur_dims`' note): one 128x reduction would sample 2x2 of each 128x128 block and the field
// would swim as the page scrolled, because it would be keyed to whichever 4 pixels the filter
// happened to land on. 1920 = 15 * 2^7, so the chain is seven exact halvings; 1080 floors its way
// down (540, 270, 135, 67, 33, 16, 8), which loses at most one row per level off a field whose
// whole output is 8 rows tall.
