//! Rust replacement for src/img.c — image decode + GL upload, same C ABI (img.h).
//! Runs on the poster worker threads (decode) + the GL/main thread (upload).
//!
//! **What the panic guard actually covers.** The `catch_unwind` below turns a decoder *panic* — a
//! bounds or arithmetic failure inside the pure-Rust JPEG/PNG decoders on a truncated or malformed
//! file — into a NULL return, so a bad poster is a missing tile instead of a dead app, and so no
//! unwind reaches the C caller. It does **not** make decoding "never crash the app", which is what
//! this doc used to claim flatly: Rust's allocation-failure path is `handle_alloc_error`, which
//! **aborts** the process. An abort unwinds nothing, so it sails straight past every `catch_unwind`
//! in the tree — and an unbounded decode on a device whose manifest declares `requiredMemory: 160`
//! is exactly how you reach one. Bounding the allocation is therefore a separate, explicit job that
//! the guard cannot do for us; see [`decode_limits`].

/// | `app/adapters/poster.rs` clearLogo (PNG) | 600×240 (`app::adapters::poster::LOGO_REQ_W`/`LOGO_REQ_H`) |
/// | `appkit/info_panel.rs` episode still | 480×270 |
/// | `ui/widgets.rs` catalog poster | 250×375 |
///
/// — plus the plex.tv sign-in QR PNG, a few hundred pixels square. 1920×1080 is thus the largest
/// thing we ever ASK for, but the cap cannot be set there: `minSize=1` means *cover*, not *fit*, so
/// the server scales until the box is filled and an extreme source aspect comes back longer on its
/// long edge (a 2.4:1 backdrop into a 16:9 box → ~2592×1080; a 2:3 poster into it → 1920×2880).
/// **4096 on each axis** is over twice the requested box, so no legitimate cover-scaled result can
/// trip it, while the classic decompression bomb (a PNG header declaring 64000×64000) is rejected
/// from its HEADER — before a single pixel buffer is allocated, which is the whole point of a
/// strict dimension limit over a byte budget alone.
///
/// **32 MiB** is the byte budget and the tighter of the two gates (4096² would need ~50 MiB even at
/// 3 bytes/px, so a bomb that squeaks under the dimension caps still dies here). It sits against a

/// for the common 1920×1080 RGB JPEG. Note it bounds the DECODER's allocations only — the

/// outside it, which is a second reason to keep this well under the device's headroom, not at it.
