//! Draw-phase instrumentation with three intentionally separate measurement modes — arm exactly
//! one per run.
//!
//! `/tmp/nativejelly-profile` selects one phase for asynchronous
//! `GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query` timing. It does not call `glFinish`; results are read on later
//! frames. `/tmp/nativejelly-hwcnt` selects one phase for direct Mali Midgard vinstr attribution.
//! An empty trigger selects `frame.ui` in either mode. `/tmp/nativejelly-cpuprof` is the third and
//! the only one that measures the CPU: the render thread's own inclusive wall time for EVERY
//! phase at once, no filter, no `glFinish`, logged as `PROFILE CPU` lines (a `~src` suffix marks
//! a phase met inside the blur source pass). It takes precedence in [`phase`] over the two GPU
//! modes, so arming it beside either silently pre-empts them.
//!
//! A selected HWCNT phase is delimited as:
//!
//! 1. `glFinish`, then a manual HWCNT dump that drains the reader's preceding interval;
//! 2. execute the phase;
//! 3. `glFinish`, then a second manual dump.
//!
//! r12p0 vinstr resets the hardware blocks on a dump and accumulates them per reader client. The
//! second buffer is therefore already the phase interval; it must **not** be subtracted from the
//! first as if both were absolute snapshots. Both raw buffers are retained in
//! `/tmp/nativejelly-hwcnt.jsonl` so that assumption can be audited against the device data.
//!
//! The HWCNT run's serialized wall duration is calibration metadata only. It is not reported as
//! GPU time. GPU phase time comes from timer-query runs, while production p50/p95/worst-frame runs
//! are collected separately with both profilers off.
//!
//! This file lived at `ui/profile.rs` and moved under `gfx` (module-layers step L5): `gfx` wraps
//! its blur and glass passes in [`phase`] and reports each blur region through
//! [`note_blur_config`], and the `gfx` layer may not name `ui`. `ui` re-exports it as
//! `ui::profile`, so every screen still wraps its draw phases the same way. The one thing the
//! profiler read FROM `ui` — the LOAD DIAL's live step — is published here instead
//! ([`publish_dial`]), by the dial that owns the decision.
// `ui/mod.rs` blankets its whole tree with this attribute, which is what kept the stub half of this
// file (the entry points a build without `devtriggers` still calls) clear of dead-code findings.
