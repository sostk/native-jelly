//! What EGL this television actually has — a boot-time capability probe, and nothing else.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The app has never asked. `docs/perf-damage-tracking-verdict.md` §6 names this as the one cheap
//! device experiment that settles a whole architectural direction: every buffer-preservation
//! scheme, "present with empty damage during playback", and `EGL_KHR_partial_update` — the
//! extension that would make partial redraw cost less than a full one on a tiler rather than more
//! — die if the driver does not advertise them. That question cannot be answered off-device and
//! it cannot be answered from the NDK sysroot, which ships a **link stub**: 44 `egl*` symbols all
//! aliased to one empty body, so the presence of `eglSetDamageRegionKHR` *there* proves only that
//! whoever generated the stub saw the name, not that this firmware implements it.
//!
//! # Why it does not link libEGL, and must not
//!
//! `-lEGL` would put `DT_NEEDED: libEGL.so.1` (the stub's SONAME) in the binary, and the loader
//! treats a missing `DT_NEEDED` as fatal at `exec()` — before `main`, before the event log opens.
//! `tools/fwcompat.py --inventory libEGL libEGLfk` says that is exactly what would happen on the
//! releases this app runs on: webOS 2.2.3 through 5.3.1 (**including this dev set at 4.10.0**)
//! carry `libEGLfk.so.2`, and their `libEGL.so.1.5` exports **no symbols at all** — it is a
//! forwarder onto `libmali.so`. The SONAME moves, which is the textbook case for
//! `dynlib.rs`'s treatment.
//!
//! But we do not even need a `dlopen`: SDL created the GLES2 context **through EGL**, so whichever
//! EGL the firmware has is already mapped into the process with its symbols in the global scope.
//! `dynlib::Handle::self_handle()` (`RTLD_DEFAULT`) therefore resolves them with no new library,
//! no new `DT_NEEDED`, and no change to the `fwcompat` matrix — the same mechanism
//! `surface::panel_resolution` uses for the SDL entry points that exist only on some firmwares.
//! A SONAME candidate list is kept as a fallback for the case where EGL is loaded privately
//! (`RTLD_LOCAL`) and so is invisible to `RTLD_DEFAULT` — opened `RTLD_NOLOAD`, so it only ever
//! reaches an EGL that is already mapped. And nothing is asked of EGL at all until
//! `eglGetCurrentContext` says a context is current on this thread (`current_with`): a desktop
//! simulator on GLX has no EGL context, and its display handle would mean nothing.
//!
//! # What it reports, and why each field is here
//!
//! - `EGL_VENDOR` / `EGL_VERSION` / `EGL_CLIENT_APIS` / **`EGL_EXTENSIONS`** — the answer.
//! - `eglGetProcAddress` for the three damage entry points. An extension string without a
//!   resolvable entry point is a driver bug we would otherwise discover by jumping through null.
//! - **`EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR`**. `EGL_KHR_partial_update` makes it an *error* to call
//!   `eglSetDamageRegionKHR` on an `EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED` surface, so what SDL configured decides
//!   whether the extension is usable at all here.
//! - **`EGL_BUFFER_AGE_KHR`**. The same spec makes it an error to set a damage region without
//!   having queried the buffer age (unless the damage is the whole buffer) — and the age is what
//!   says *how many frames back* the inherited content is, which is the number a damage ring has
//!   to union over. A driver that does not answer this closes the partial-update direction
//!   outright, whatever the extension string says.
//! - `GL_EXTENSIONS`, which nothing in the app logged either.
//!
//! The probe is diagnostic only: it runs exactly once at boot, and no other module reads it — it
//! exists to put a fact in the event log. The one exception to "boot only" is [`fence`], which
//! the draw path DOES call — `gfx::field_kick` fences the underlay-field reduction so its
//! read-back is taken only once the GPU has finished it — and which resolves its entry points the
//! same way, for the same `DT_NEEDED` reason.

// screen as usual. If the driver honours the rect, the tiles outside it are never rasterized:
// `FRAG_ACTIVE`/`ARITH_WORDS`/`GPU_ACTIVE` must collapse, and the picture outside the rect must
// visibly go stale or garbage. If the counters do not move and the picture is perfect, the entry
// point is a no-op and the whole partial-update direction is closed on this television.
//
// DELIBERATELY DESTRUCTIVE, which is the point: a correct dirty-rect renderer would draw only
// inside the rect, and then a wrong picture would prove nothing. Drawing everything makes the
