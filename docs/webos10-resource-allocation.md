# webOS 10 refuses every H.264 Load — and so refuses every server transcode

**Status: MEASURED, device-verified both ways; the measured half is FIXED on `main` since
2026-09-03, the rest is still open.** The one-line change below was proven in the lab slot that
found the bug and then deliberately reverted, because it was not the ABR defect that session was
booked for. What landed afterwards is exactly the measured shape and no more —
`engine::sink_envelope`: H.264 declares `1920x1080@60` when the session's widest raster fits FHD
(the transcode case, i.e. most of a library), keeps `3840x2160@60` otherwise, HEVC is unchanged,
and the device's own per-codec row (now read WITH `maxFrameRate`) clamps only when the table was
actually measured. The asynchronous `type=18` is also a verdict now (§3.5's second defect). NOT
re-measured on 10.3.1. **The frame-rate leg was run on the dev set (webOS 4.10) on 2026-09-03
instead, with `/tmp/nativejelly-sinkmax=WxH@F`, and it is a discriminator there too — in a
different way:** a 4K H.264 24p direct play declared `3840x2160@60` is announced by the pipeline as
`frameRate:24` and then, a second later, `frameRate:30` (`smp_cb type=4` twice), i.e. a 24p
stream presented on a 30 fps lattice; declared `@24` or `@30` it is announced as 24 once and held.
4K HEVC under `@60` and 1080p H.264 under `@60` hold 24. The sink's own displayed-frame counter
(payload `streamQualityInfoNonFlushable`, callback type 47) measured the consequence: **13.0 fps
presented under `@60`, 24.1 fps under `@24`, zero counted drops either way.** H.264 therefore
declares the stream's rate class now (`engine::fps_class`). Whether declaring 24 at 4K also loads on 10.3.1 is the one leg
still unrun. **Field evidence, 2026-09:** opt-in PostHog events from v0.6.6 show `playback.started`
with `mode=transcode` on four different chips reporting release 10.3.1 (K24_DVB, O22A3_DVB,
LM21A_DVB, O24_ATSC), so the fix holds on that firmware in the field; nobody here has watched it.
The account below is left as it was written, as the evidence.

## The defect

`player/engine.rs`'s streamed A/V path declares the Starfish sink envelope as the panel maximum,
**regardless of the codec being fed**:

```rust
// Sink envelope = the panel max (4K) regardless of codec; the pipeline reads the
// true dims from the bitstream (SPS), so this is just a ceiling and is correct for a
// 4K stream (HEVC transcode / HEVC direct-play) AND harmless for a 1080p H264 file.
let (mw, mh) = (3840, 2160);
```

with `build_av_payload` additionally forcing `"maxFrameRate":60`. So every streamed Load carries
`adaptiveStreaming: { maxWidth: 3840, maxHeight: 2160, maxFrameRate: 60 }`.

**The final clause of that comment is true on webOS 4.10 and false on 10.3.1.** The pipeline
allocates against the DECLARED ceiling rather than against the bitstream, and no AVC decoder on
that SoC can allocate 4K60. The Load is refused:

```
smp_cb type=18 num=601 str=Resource Allocation Error
```

**The control makes it airtight.** The identical envelope with `"H265"` in the codec node loaded
and played 197+ frames in the same session, minutes apart. The difference is the declared codec,
not the link, the server, the content or the hour.

## Why this is a ship-blocker rather than an edge case

Every Plex server transcode targets H.264 (or falls back to it). So on webOS 10:

- **HEVC direct play** — fine.
- **Every transcode** — refused at Load, before a frame, before the video plane binds.
- **ABR never runs at all** on that content: the rung machinery lives downstream of a Load that
  never completes.

The dev set is webOS 4.10, where the over-declaration is harmless, which is exactly why three
years of testing never showed it.

## The A/B, which was run

Same slot, same set, byte-identical declaration `load: v=H264 a="AAC" fps=0.000`:

| build | result |
|---|---|
| unpatched | `601 Resource Allocation Error`, **twice** |
| patched | `SMP loadCompleted` in **117 ms**, then primed/Play, HLS segments, and ABR commits (`committed Down to 2000kbps 1280x720` -> `720kbps 854x480`) |

The patch was `let (mw, mh) = if vc == "H265" { (3840, 2160) } else { (1920, 1080) };`.

## Why that patch is a DEMONSTRATION and not the fix

`1920x1080` under-declares a genuine 4K H.264 file, which was never tested in that slot. Two
further findings constrain the real fix:

1. **"Take the ceiling from devcaps" is refuted.** That was the first answer and the session kills
   it: the set's own `device_codec_capability_config.json` claims **4096x2176 for H.264 too**
   (`devcaps: hevc=true 4096x2176` is the MIN across both decoders' rows). Width and height were
   never the binding constraint, so a devcaps-derived raster would have declared 4K again and
   failed again.
2. **The discriminator is almost certainly `maxFrameRate`** — which `devcaps.rs` parses and then
   **drops by design** (`CLAUDE.md` already records the profile bounding no frame rate). Declaring
   4K **at 60** is what cannot be allocated. That also fits (1): the raster was legal, the rate
   was not.

So the principled fix declares the dimensions **and rate the stream will actually carry**, which
the demux knows, rather than a panel ceiling — and it needs a 4K H.264 leg to confirm, which no
session has run.

## What else that hour settled (all firsts, all on 10.3.1)

- The webOS 5+ **`VP_EXPORTED`** path works: `_Window_Id_N` created, spliced into the payload,
  `placed rv=1`, re-placed once real dimensions arrive.
- The **bundled FFmpeg** 63/63/61 loads on a set shipping FFmpeg 6 itself.
- The **pinned-TLS** diagnostics upload survives libcurl 7.82 / OpenSSL 3.0.13.
- **4K HEVC DV Profile 8 + Atmos** direct-plays from a shared server over the public internet.
- The lab's virtual remote **does** send colour keys; **BLUE = wcode 489**, same as the Magic
  Remote (484/485 exist there and map to nothing of ours).

## Second defect from the same hour, also unfiled

A **remote cold start burns ~16 s** probing LAN addresses that cannot work from abroad, before
falling back to the public HTTPS URI. Not measured further; recorded so it is not rediscovered.

## What would settle the remaining question

One lab slot, a 4K H.264 item, and three legs: panel ceiling (expect 601), stream-derived
dimensions at the stream's own frame rate (expect load), and stream-derived dimensions at 60
(expect 601 if the rate is the discriminator, load if it is not). That third leg is the experiment
— the other two only bracket it.
