# Movie & TV parity gaps vs. the official Plex clients

Audited 2026-07-29 against reference screenshots of the **official webOS Plex client** (sign-in,
home, show/episode detail, movie detail, library grid, card context menu) and **Plex HTPC** (player
HUD, Quality picker, queue overlay, Settings tree). Branch `home-ui-polish`, working tree included.

**Scope: movies and TV shows only.** Music, photos, Live TV/DVR and podcasts are out of scope and
are not counted as gaps. Plex Discover / "Movies & Shows on Plex" is movie/show content but is an
*adjacent catalog* (plex.tv, not the user's server) and is tagged as such throughout.

**Method.** Two fan-out audits (14 + 12 agents): one auditor per product domain read our source and
enumerated the reference feature set against it, then an adversarial verifier tried to *refute* each
claim by finding an existing implementation under another name, in another file, behind a dev
trigger, or in the data layer. 209 gaps claimed, 209 confirmed, 0 refuted. Three claims were then
spot-checked by hand (`widgets.rs:511`, `metadata.rs:64`, `detail.rs:1180`) and all held.

## Parity means the capability, never the presentation

The reference clients put nearly every action behind a **full-screen modal sheet** — a title, a
subtitle, and a column of full-width rounded buttons. **We are not copying that.** Our idiom is the
Apple-TV popover: a `ui/popover.rs` container over the live screen with a `ui/table.rs` `TableView`
inside, exactly as `ui/track_menu.rs` and the library sort/filter menus already work. Every gap
below names a *capability* we lack; the presentation stays ours.

This matters practically, because the popover machinery is already built and tested. The expensive
half of "add a context menu" is the eight-to-ten **actions**, not the shell.

---

## 0. Not a parity gap — one live regression in the working tree

**`app.rs:1409` — OK on the Subtitles/Audio discs is dead code.**

```rust
} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {          // 1409: EMPTY body
} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {          // 1410: identical condition — unreachable
    crate::ui::track_menu::open_tab(...);
```

A duplicated `else if` with an empty body shadows the real branch, so pressing OK on a focused
Subtitles or Audio disc does nothing at all — no menu, no pause, no log line. The discs still draw,
still take focus, and LEFT/RIGHT still walks between them, so the control looks completely alive.

- **Introduced by the uncommitted skip-pill / Up-Next work on this branch** (`git diff` shows both
  lines as `+`). Rust does not warn on a duplicated `else if` condition, which is why it survived.
- **The on-device suite is blind to it**: the pointer path (`app.rs:1685`, via `player_hud::icon_hit`)
  and the `/tmp/nativejelly-menu` trigger both still reach `track_menu::open_tab`, and the harness
  drives the trigger.
- **Fix: delete line 1409.** Three independent auditors found this one.

---

## 1. The five gaps that block a normal user

1. **No search, anywhere** — **being closed; the Search screen is the feature that closes it.** The
   only way to reach a title was to scroll the grid or the A–Z rail. `plex/hubs.rs` `Client::search`
   → `GET /hubs/search` was written and typed with **zero callers** (`plex/mod.rs` admitted it). The
   fetch was done; the cost was thought to be an on-screen alphanumeric keyboard — and the PIN pad in
   `ui/profiles.rs` is private state, not a reusable widget, so that was assumed net-new.

   **The one thing this estimate got badly wrong: no keyboard is being written, because the
   television has one.** Stock `SDL_StartTextInput()` raises the system panel — LG's Wayland video
   driver carries a complete `text_model` IME client behind SDL's standard screen-keyboard hooks, and
   typed text arrives as an ordinary `SDL_TEXTINPUT`. So the half of this gap that was priced `large`
   did not exist; the cost is the screen, not the keys. `SDL_webOS.h` is what made that hard to see:
   it declares eight entry points and not one of them is a keyboard. **`docs/search.md` §3** records
   the whole seam, including the three traps that make it non-obvious (a webOS-shifted
   `SDL_TEXTINPUT` whose text is at +16, `SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS` as a silent precondition, and a
   reopen wedge we inherit) and the two dead ends nobody should retry.

   **What has landed, and what has not — do not read this entry as "done" without checking.**
   Landed: `Route::Search` as a **peer** of Home and the Library (`app.rs`), the strip's last pill,
   the five-file `ui/search/` split, `search.rs`'s query state and result types, and the wire facts
   in §*Endpoints* below. **Not yet landed as of this entry:** the drawing and the fetch —
   `ui/search/`'s `draw` bodies are `{}` and `search::pump` lands nothing, so **`Client::search` still
   has zero callers**. The one-line check for whether that is still true is whether
   `plex/mod.rs`'s "no callers yet" admission still names `search`; when it no longer does, this gap
   is closed outright and this paragraph should go.

   **Out of scope either way:** results are **server-only**. Plex Discover / Watchlist catalog hits
   remain their own gap (§ *Adjacent catalog*, below). `GET /hubs/search/voice` is not implemented,
   and `Client::search` sends `query` + `limit` only — there is no `?sectionId=` scoping, so search is
   account-wide and cannot be narrowed to one library.

2. **No item context menu at all.** The reference client's whole action vocabulary hangs off
   press-and-hold. Ours is *detected and deliberately dropped*: `press.rs:47` `LONG_MS = 500`,
   `press.rs:173` latches `want_commit=false`, `app.rs:2293` disarms without activating, and
   `is_long`/`was_long` have zero call sites. There is no MENU/OPTIONS wcode arm in the entire key
   handler. This is why Remove-from-Continue-Watching, per-episode mark-watched, Play-from-Start and
   Go-to-Show have nowhere to live.

3. **"Go to Show" is unreachable.** *Not* because OK plays immediately — **that is intentional**: a
   Continue Watching tile resumes on OK by design, and the amber play badge on the card is the
   affordance that says so (`home_activate`, `app.rs:888`). The gap is the **other** half of that
   interaction: long-press should open the item menu with **Go to Show** in it, and #2 above is why
   there is nowhere for it to go. Until the menu exists, a CW tile can only be resumed — the show
   page, the synopsis, a different episode and the watched toggle have no route. Go to Show is the
   action to design the menu around.

4. **Play on a show starts S1E1, not on-deck.** `detail.rs:1180` calls `play_episode_at(0)` against
   `cur_season`, which `fetch_full` sets to `seasons[0]` (`metadata.rs:352`). Open a half-watched show,
   press Play, and you restart season 1 episode 1. The Home hero pill fires the same path, and the
   label is the constant `c"Play"` with no episode context and no resume/restart distinction.

5. **Mid-playback failure used to be a silent freeze.** It now enters a cause-aware full-screen Error
   read-out even after frames, and OK opens the shared quality ladder: selecting the current rung
   retries the same item/position/tracks, while another rung retries under that policy; BACK exits.
   The Engine is still terminal and a generic manual/fixed failure is not automatically converted.
   Cold Auto Original is the deliberate exception: if its first open fails before a frame, the pump
   immediately starts the retained bootstrap HLS rung. A runtime HLS→Original experiment instead
   rolls back to the exact live HLS encoder it held until source frames.

---

## 2. The seven themes behind the 209 items

**A. Watched state is half-modelled.** `Episode` (`metadata.rs:64`) carries `resume_ms` but **no
`view_count`** — the field is on the wire and never read. So a fully-watched episode is
indistinguishable from one never started, posters carry no checkmark badge, and related/grid tiles
carry no watched state. Playback does invalidate each owner's shelves through that owner's retained
Browse publication; the remaining gap is the absent episode/season state to publish. The one watched
toggle we do have (`detail.rs:1157`) acts on `metadata::current()`, which on a show page is the
**show** — so it scrobbles every leaf. There is no per-episode or per-season mark.

**B. The detail page is a show page wearing an episode's clothes.** `draw_hero` always renders the
container: title, meta line, synopsis, date and runtime are show-level and do not change as episode
focus moves through the filmstrip. Missing: the episode hero, ratings (TMDB/critic/audience — never
fetched or modelled), Rate & Review, media badges (1080p / EAC3 / SRT), "Directed by", crew in the
"Cast & Crew" shelf (`Director[]`/`Writer[]` are parsed and thrown away), Extras, actionable cast,
tagline/studio (parsed, never drawn), Play→Resume, and Play-from-Start. **And the detail page ignores
the Magic Remote pointer entirely** — no hit-tests exist in `ui/detail.rs`, on the device's primary
input, while every other screen handles clicks.

**C. Library browse is a permanent type destination.** We ship Movies and TV Shows grids; the
reference ships Recommended (the
section's own hubs), Library, Collections and Categories. Collections are reached through the
All grid's TYPE menu rather than a tab of their own; there is no category
browse axis beyond genre, and the filter menu exposes **1 facet out of the server's ~27** —
`Meta.Type[].Filter[]` is not even parsed, so the server's own menu is discarded on arrival.
Additional same-type libraries are addressed through the Source panel rather than extra top pills.

**D. The transport is a scrubber and two discs.** No play/pause button (it is an unlabelled
fallthrough; the drawn Pause glyph is documented as "a state read-out, not an action toggle"), no
prev/next episode, no queue glyph, no kebab, no quality badge, no clock. Missing on the rail:
chapter/marker ticks, buffered extent, BIF scrub thumbnails. And the **Chapters tab never appears for
the main episode-play path** — the response carries `Chapter[]` and it is discarded.

**E. The app now has a Settings surface, but not a playback-preferences system.** The account menu
opens Settings for Home/server selection, Privacy & data, Legal notices and About. Preferred
audio/subtitle language, auto-skip intro/credits, subtitle appearance and sync,
quality-per-network, direct-play policy and version choice remain absent, as does the general
preference store they would require. Track choices are still forgotten at every item boundary, and
the server's own per-part selection is written but never read back.

**F. The play queue is created and discarded.** Every playback POSTs `/playQueues` with `continuous=1`
and gets the full `Metadata[]` window back; `plex/timeline.rs:72` keeps **only the successor** and drops
the rest (deliberately — a `Metadata` row carries the whole Media/Part/Stream/Role tree, and this runs
on a 32-bit TV). So there is no queue list, no jump-to-member, no reorder, no Play Next, and Up Next
fires **only** when the server produced a credits marker — without one, the episode ends and the next
starts instantly, with no tile, no countdown, and no way to cancel. Fix shape: project each row to a
lean struct on the worker exactly as `route.rs:403` `up_next_of` already does.

**G. Quality is one hard-coded rung.** ~~`maxVideoBitrate=60000` at `3840x2160`, and `TranscodeSpec` has
no field to vary it. No picker, no ladder~~ — **LANDED 2026-08-24: `route::Quality` has Original,
five fixed rungs and Auto in the `…` popover; `TranscodeSpec` carries `Ceiling`; the choice persists
in `Session`. Legacy/malformed/missing values stay Original, while a fresh install starts on Auto.
Auto treats Original as a separate MODE compared by utility rather than as a top rung (rewritten
2026-08-25; `docs/adaptive-playback.md`): Local admits it immediately and direct Remote requires a
completed bounded actual-file sample whose delivery sustains source consumption. Otherwise Auto uses measured
fixed-session HLS and replaces a PMS encoder only after candidate media has passed its complete
end-to-end acquisition and content-buffer gates. A direct Remote that slows after startup is watched
continuously and moves to HLS at the current position on a starvation horizon in seconds —
immediately when a stall is imminent, on a deficit that persists and that the utility comparison
agrees with, or on an emergency reserve guard. HLS measures each candidate before commit: the first
unknown excursion asks the maximum informative request, while failed response-size endpoints guide
a minimax midpoint search that may jump farther when the conservative delivery/refill model
supports it.**
Still open: no direct-play/direct-stream policy toggles (the version picker this line once listed
now exists on the Jellyfin backend, `docs/jellyfin-playback.md`), and a
failed manual/fixed direct play still needs the viewer to choose quality or retry rather than
automatically falling back to transcode. Cold Auto Original does automatically start its retained
HLS contingency. Auto also has a measured way back mid-session, and it needs neither the top rung
nor a fixed number of probes: bounded source probes, gated on a non-draining reserve that pays both
bounded probe phases plus `max(R_s,D)`, re-establish the source requirement to the estimate's own
confidence. An insufficient or failed request rearms only on confidence-separated stronger HLS
evidence. After a completed terminal comparison, an upward HLS commit re-scores the retained source
evidence, while a downshift retires that old-regime result before a fresh bounded request. The
controller serializes each finite probe between HLS acquisitions under the exact active resource identity;
there is no probe-time stop, close or replacement, and the recovered playback stays watched by the
same rule.

## 3. Cheap wins — major impact, small effort

Ranked. Each is one file, roughly under 150 lines.

| # | Gap | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Delete the dead `else if` — restores the track menus on the remote | `app.rs:1409` |
| 2 | Parse `viewCount` into `Episode` → episode checkmarks, per-episode watched | `metadata.rs:64` |
| 3 | Raise/scroll `MAX_TABS` → libraries 5+ become reachable | `ui/widgets.rs:511` |
| 4 | Play-from-Start + Play→Resume relabel on the detail hero | `ui/detail.rs:833` |
| 5 | Keep `Chapter[]` on the episode-play path → the Chapters tab appears | `metadata.rs`, `ui/chapters_panel.rs` |
| 6 | ~~Chapter~~ + intro/credits ticks on the scrubber rail — **chapter ticks BUILT then REMOVED at the owner's request (taste, not a defect); do not re-add. Intro/credits bands shipped and stay.** | `ui/player_hud.rs:412` |
| 7 | Surface `Director[]`/`Writer[]` — already parsed, thrown away | `ui/detail.rs` |
| 8 | Read back the server's per-part stream selection | `plex/models.rs`, `route.rs` |
| 9 | Add bitrate/width/height/`videoResolution` to the DTO (unblocks the whole ladder) | `plex/models.rs` |
| 10 | Retain lean queue rows instead of dropping them (unblocks the queue overlay) | `plex/timeline.rs:72` |
| 11 | Scale image subtitles from the subtitle canvas — VobSub/DVD subs land as a postage stamp today | `player/`, `ui/player_hud.rs:109` |
| 12 | Home loading/empty/error state + retry on a failed hub fetch | `ui/home.rs` |
| ~~13~~ | ~~Label a signed-in account without Plex Home users correctly (says "Sign in")~~ **CLOSED 2026-08-23** | `ui/account_menu.rs`, `ui/widgets.rs` |
| 14 | Parse `id`/`filter`/`tagKey`/`count` onto `Tag` — unblocks the person page *and* Categories browse | `plex/models.rs:272` |
| 15 | **Mark Season Watched** — `Season.rk` already exists and `scrobble` takes any rating key; this is a menu row calling code we have | `metadata.rs:80`, `plex/library.rs` |
| 16 | Copy `leafCount`/`viewedLeafCount` onto `Season` (already parsed at `models.rs:150`) — gives season tab counts *and* the season watched state | `metadata.rs:80` |
| 17 | Parse `Rating[]` + `audienceRating`/`ratingImage` — the whole ratings row, RT included | `plex/models.rs` |

---

## 4. What this device makes hard, or impossible

Worth deciding *not* to build, rather than discovering mid-implementation:

- **Playback speed (0.5×–2×) — likely impossible.** We hand-feed access units into a BUFFERSTREAM
  pipeline; there is no rate primitive on the seam, and the symbol is unproven (the stub-`.so` trick
  makes every link succeed whether or not the symbol exists on the device). Needs `bind-tv-lib-abi`
  proof before any code.
- **Audio boost / normalisation / downmix, done client-side — architecturally impossible.** We pass
  *compressed* audio through to LG's pipeline; there is no PCM stage we own to apply gain in.
  **Correction (issue #266, landed):** Boost dialog and Normalize loudness are NOT client-side DSP —
  PMS 1.43.4+ Plex Pass servers apply `boostDialog`/`normalizeLoudness` on the TRANSCODER, so the
  client only ever asks for the params on an Original-family route (direct play or the
  codec-preserving remux) and reads the server's own verdict back. Downmix remains an unclaimed
  gap; see the audio-settings entries below.
- **Deinterlace / video-sync settings — impossible and moot.** Decode, deinterlace and scaling all
  happen inside Starfish/ACB on the hardware plane.
- **Adaptive quality is no longer in this list.** Auto now owns a measured HLS segment loop and
  swaps fixed-rendition PMS encoders after a candidate segment passes complete end-to-end
  acquisition, raster and A/V-buffer gates. Progressive playback remains the path for Original and
  fixed qualities.
- **Subtitle sync offset — free wherever the client draws the subtitle**: direct play, and a
  conversion that delivers it softly. Only a burned subtitle (the server's `Encode`) has none.
- **ASS/SSA styling now uses bundled libass** on a worker; it does not depend on a firmware or NDK copy. See `docs/ass-subtitles.md`.
- **"Force Direct Play" is genuinely unsafe here** and must be gated or relabelled, not passed through.
- **Frame step — no step primitive** in the buffer-feed seam (`src/starfish.c` exposes Play/Pause/flush).
- **A clock is trivial to draw but the time is not trivial to read** — the app has no luna-service
  client for the system clock.
- **BIF scrub thumbnails — substantial**: tens of MB of concatenated JPEGs against a 32-bit heap.
- **Plex Companion / remote control — awkward**: there is no HTTP *server* in the app; `stream.rs` is
  client-only.

## 5. Owner-pinned designs

Two gaps where the owner has supplied the target design. **In both cases the reference is Apple TV,
not Plex** — Plex's own version of each screen is a feature checklist, not a mockup.

### 5a. The Continue Watching long-press menu

Target: Apple TV's card context menu — a **popover anchored beside the focused card**, not a
full-screen sheet, not a centred modal. Construction, from the reference:

- Rounded ~20px translucent dark panel with a blur, floating to the side of the card; the card and
  the rest of the shelf stay visible and in place behind it.
- Each row is `[leading icon] [label]`, left-aligned. The **focused row is a filled light rounded
  pill** spanning the panel width — the same selection language `ui/table.rs` already draws.
- A **hairline separator groups navigation actions from state actions**.
- Reference rows, in order: `Go to Episode` · `Go to Show` — separator — `Remove from Watchlist` ·
  `Mark as Watched` · `Browse Continue Watching`.

Our rows, adapted (Watchlist doesn't exist yet; see the account domain):

| Row | Status |
|---|---|
| **Go to Episode** | `screens::item_menu::Action::GoToItem`; `app::input::apply_item_action` opens that detail entry — exists |
| **Go to Show** | `screens::item_menu::Action::GoToShow`; `app::input::apply_item_action` opens the show detail entry with the season — exists |
| — separator — | |
| **Mark as Watched** | needs `viewCount` on `Episode` (cheap win #2); `scrobble` takes any rating key |
| **Play from Start** | needs the restart path (cheap win #4) |
| **Remove from Continue Watching** | needs the hub-removal call — not yet written |

Built on `ui/table.rs`, fired from the existing long-press latch (`press::LONG_MS`) — and, since
UI-restructure phase 10, as an owned `Style::Compact` surface (`screens/item_menu.rs`) on the
shared `ModalStack` rather than a `ui/popover.rs` `Popover` with a route of its own.
`ui/table.rs` needs one addition: **a leading-icon column and a separator row** (`ui/icons.rs` already
rasterises SVG masks). Per `ui/CLAUDE.md`, that belongs in the shared table, not in the menu screen.

### 5b. The person / actor page

Plex's own person page (left portrait, "Actor, Producer, Director", Born + age, bio, Facebook and
Instagram handles, a Filmography button, then "Movies & Shows in Media Libraries" with a count badge,
"Known For" with role + season count, and "Featured Videos"). **We follow Apple TV's instead**:
centred circular portrait, name, a 3-line bio truncated with an inline `MORE`, then plain `Movies` and
`Shows` shelves of ordinary poster cards — the card language we already ship.

**Verified live against the PMS on 2026-07-29** (this is not in `docs/pms-api.md` — add it):

`Role[]`, `Director[]` and `Writer[]` each carry **six** attributes, and we parse three:

```json
{ "id": 161, "filter": "actor=161", "tag": "Idina Menzel",
  "tagKey": "5d77682aeb5d26001f1de4b0", "count": 3,
  "role": "Elsa (voice)",
  "thumb": "https://metadata-static.plex.tv/c/people/ccf2f89….jpg" }
```

`plex/models.rs:272` `Tag` keeps only `tag`, `role`, `thumb` — **dropping `id`, `filter`, `tagKey` and
`count`, which is the entire reason a person page is unbuildable today.** Consequences:

- **There is a dedicated person endpoint pair, and it is in `docs/plex-openapi.json`** (it is *not* in
  `docs/pms-api.md`): `GET /library/people/{personId}` and `GET /library/people/{personId}/media`.
  `personId` accepts **either** the numeric tag `id` **or** the `tagKey` hex guid — both verified live
  against `id=161` and `tagKey=5d77682a…`, returning the same record. `…/media` returns the person's
  items **across every library in one request** (verified: `/library/people/161/media` → 3 items),
  which is better than the per-section `?actor=<id>` sweep. Group by each row's `type` client-side to
  fill the Apple-TV `Movies` and `Shows` shelves — the container's `viewGroup` is unreliable (it read
  `"movie"` on a response whose only row was a `show`). `?actor=<id>` still works and is the right call
  when you want *one* section. `count` on the Tag is Plex's "9" badge, free.
- **Headshots already work through the existing pipeline.** `thumb` is an absolute
  `https://metadata-static.plex.tv/…` URL, which our raw-socket client could never fetch (no DNS, no
  TLS) — but `image_transcode_path` (`plex/transcoder.rs:52`) passes it as `url=` to `/photo/:/transcode`
  and **the server does the TLS**. This is already how the cast circles render; nothing new is needed.
- **The bio, birth date and social handles are still NOT available from the local server.** The person
  record PMS returns is only the tag — `{id, filter, tag, tagType, thumb, tagKey}`, no `summary`, no
  birth date. (My first pass tested `GET /library/metadata/{tagKey}`, which 404s; that was the wrong
  endpoint. `/library/people/{id}` is the right one and it still carries no bio.) That header content
  needs a plex.tv call over libcurl (`net.rs` already does TLS+DNS for the account layer). Design the
  header to **degrade to name + portrait** when that call is absent or fails — which suits the Apple TV
  layout, where the bio is a 3-line block with a `MORE` affordance rather than a labelled field list.
- **Bonus:** `GET /library/sections/{sec}/actor` returns the whole actor list (51 on this server), each
  row carrying `fastKey: "/library/sections/1/all?actor=3901"` and a thumb. That is the *Categories →
  by Actor* browse axis (theme C) for free, from the same DTO fix.

So cheap win #14 (four fields on one struct) unblocks the person page, the Categories browse axis, and
the crew credits that are currently parsed and discarded.

### 5c. The detail-page action row, and watched-state granularity

The reference detail page has **six circular action buttons**; we have two (`detail.rs:88` `NBTN = 2`):

| # | Button | Us |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ▶ Play | ✅ |
| 2 | ↺ Play from start / restart | ❌ (cheap win #4) |
| 3 | 🔖 Watchlist | ❌ (plex.tv — see the account domain) |
| 4 | ⊘✓ Mark as watched | ✅ but wrong scope — see below |
| 5 | ↥ Share | ❌ (plex.tv/social) |
| 6 | … More | ❌ — and this is the one that matters, because it hosts the rest |

**Watched state needs three scopes, and we have one.** Plex's More menu carries `Mark Season Watched`
and `Delete Season` alongside the item-level rows — so the vocabulary is **episode / season / show**.
Ours only ever scrobbles `metadata::current()`, which on a show page is the *show*, so the single
toggle marks every leaf in the series. Verified live, all three scopes are trivially reachable:

- **Season has its own `ratingKey`** — `/library/metadata/{show}/children` returns
  `rk=438 idx=1 leaves=10 viewed=10` / `rk=1802 idx=2 leaves=10 viewed=1`. Our `Season`
  (`metadata.rs:80`) already keeps `rk`, and `plex/library.rs` `scrobble`/`unscrobble` take **any**
  rating key — so **"Mark Season Watched" is a menu row wired to code that already exists.**
- **`leafCount`/`viewedLeafCount` are already parsed** at `plex/models.rs:150-153` and simply not
  copied onto our `Season`. They give the season tab counts (theme B) *and* whether a season is fully
  watched, in the same two fields.
- **Episode scope** still needs `viewCount` on `Episode` (cheap win #2) — the one genuinely missing field.

### 5d. Ratings — Rotten Tomatoes is on the wire, we parse none of it

Verified live on a movie item. PMS sends both a flat pair and a full array:

```
rating              9.1     ratingImage          rottentomatoes://image.rating.ripe
audienceRating      8.5     audienceRatingImage  rottentomatoes://image.rating.upright
Rating[] = [ {imdb://image.rating, 7.4, audience}, {rottentomatoes://image.rating.ripe, 9.1, critic},
             {rottentomatoes://image.rating.upright, 8.5, audience}, {themoviedb://image.rating, 7.8, audience} ]
```

`plex/models.rs` parses **none** of it — no `Rating[]`, no `audienceRating`, no `ratingImage`. We show
`contentRating` ("TV-14") only, which is a different thing entirely.

Two things to note when building it. First, the `image` string encodes **both the provider and the icon
state** — `rottentomatoes://image.rating.**ripe**` is the fresh tomato and `…rating.**upright**` is the
standing popcorn, with `rotten`/`spilled` as their negative variants — so the badge art is chosen by
parsing that string, not by comparing the number to a threshold. Second, those icons are client-side
assets in every Plex client; we would add tomato/popcorn/IMDb/TMDB masks to `assets/icons/`, which
`ui/icons.rs` already rasterises and caches. Prefer `Rating[]` over the flat pair — it is the superset
and carries the provider identity the reference badge needs.

## 6. Most of this is already specified — use `docs/plex-openapi.json`

`docs/plex-openapi.json` is an **OpenAPI 3.1 spec for Plex Media Server 1.2.2 with 205 paths and 64
schemas**, and it is badly under-used: `docs/pms-api.md` (the hand-verified reference the data layer is
written against) covers a fraction of it. Several gaps above were written as "no endpoint" or "needs a
call that isn't written" when the endpoint is in fact specified — and, where checked, works. **Check
the spec before designing any new data call.**

Corrections to the gap list, all verified live against the PMS on 2026-07-29 unless marked:

| Gap as filed | What the spec actually gives |
|---|---|
| "Extras — no endpoint, no DTO, nothing" | **`GET /library/metadata/{ids}/extras`** — verified: 18 rows on one movie item, each with a `subtype` (`trailer`, `behindTheScenes`) and a duration. That subtype is the shelf caption. The shelf and the DTO landed 2026-09-14 (`Detail.extras`). |
| "No collections call" | **`GET /library/sections/{id}/collections`**, **`GET /library/collections/{id}/items`**, plus full create/add/remove/move |
| "The filter menu exposes 1 facet out of the server's ~27" | **`GET /library/sections/{id}/filters`** — verified: **exactly 27** (`genre, year, decade, contentRating, collection, director, actor, writer, producer, country, studio, resolution, hdr, dovi, atmos, unwatched, inProgress, unmatched, videoCodec, audioCodec, subtitleCodec, audioLayout, audioLanguage, subtitleLanguage, editionTitle, label, location`) |
| "No Categories browse" | **`GET /library/sections/{id}/categories`**, plus `GET /library/tags?type=` and the per-axis `fastKey` links |
| "No per-section Recommended tab" | **`GET /hubs/sections/{sectionId}`** |
| "No queue reorder, no PlayQueue move call" | **`PUT /playQueues/{id}/items/{playQueueItemId}/move`**, **`DELETE …/items/{playQueueItemId}`**, **`PUT …/shuffle`** / **`/unshuffle`** / **`/reset`**, and **`GET /playQueues/{id}`** to re-fetch |
| "No Shuffle Season" | the same `PUT /playQueues/{id}/shuffle` |
| "No post-play card" | **`GET /hubs/metadata/{id}/postplay`** — a purpose-built endpoint |
| "You cannot rate an item" | **`PUT /:/rate`** (the rating half of Rate & Review; the *review* text is plex.tv) |
| "Related is flattened into one nameless 20-item strip" | **`GET /hubs/metadata/{id}/related`** returns it already grouped into named hubs — we call the flat `/related`. Also `GET /library/metadata/{ids}/similar`. |
| "No search screen" | **`GET /hubs/search`** (already wrapped in `plex/hubs.rs`), plus `GET /hubs/search/voice`. **The screen is being built — §1.1.** `/hubs/search/voice` is not, and neither is `?sectionId=` scoping. Two wire facts cost real time and are now written down in `Hub`'s doc (`plex/models.rs`) rather than here: a search response returns **every** hub type the server knows, most with `size: 0`, and its items arrive in **two** containers — `Metadata[]` for movie/show/episode but `Directory[]` for actor/director/collection, which `plex-openapi.json`'s own worked example gets wrong |
| Person page | **`GET /library/people/{personId}`** + **`/media`** — see §5b |

**Still genuinely unspecified**, so verify against the live server before writing code:

- **Remove from Continue Watching.** Not in this spec. `GET /hubs/continueWatching` exists (fetch), but
  no removal action — Plex's own client uses a newer `/actions/…` route this 1.2.2 spec predates.
- **Watchlist** and everything Discover — plex.tv, not PMS, so it is out of this spec by construction.
- **BIF scrub thumbnails** — `GET /library/sections/{id}/indexes` appears; the per-part index path the
  player would actually stream is not described.

## Superseded by owner decisions

This report is a dated audit snapshot; its findings describe the state on 2026-07-29 and are left
intact as a record. Where a later owner decision overrides one, it is noted here rather than by
rewriting the finding — but read this list before acting on the tables above, because several
entries would otherwise be rebuilt.

- **Chapter ticks on the scrubber rail (cheap win #6) — removed after shipping.** Owner: *"I don't
  like chapters markers in HUD. Just remove it."* A taste call, not a defect. The intro/credits
  marker bands are a different feature (they belong to Skip Intro) and remain. Do not re-add the
  ticks; `ui/player_hud.rs` carries the same warning at the call site.
- **Season tab episode counts — removed after shipping.** Owner wants the fully-watched tick only.
- **Rating provider marks are client-side assets.** §5d's advice stands, but do not go looking for
  them on the server: probed three ways (mediaTagPrefix 404s while sibling categories serve PNGs,
  Media-Flags.bundle has no rating category, and the Plex web bundle imports them as SVG
  components). Also: five states, not four — `certified` joins ripe/rotten/upright/spilled.
- **Person bio IS available**, contradicting §5b's "not available from the local server". True of
  PMS, but `GET https://discover.provider.plex.tv/library/people/{tagKey}` serves `summary`,
  `bornAt`, `birthPlace`, `knownFor`, `External[]` socials and `CreditType[]`. Three facts that
  cost time to establish, all verified live:
  - The **`tagKey` guid is the only id that works** — the numeric tag `id` PMS accepts returns
    `404 "Invalid value provided for metadataId!"`. Carry both off the credits row.
  - **`Accept: application/json` is the only header that matters** (else it answers XML). No token
    is needed; `X-Plex-Product`/`X-Plex-Client-Identifier` are **not** required. An earlier note
    here claimed they were — that was a confounded probe whose original 404 came from the wrong
    path (`/library/metadata/{tagKey}`), corrected in the same step the headers were added.
  - An **unknown person is `200` with `totalSize: 0`**, not a 404; treating it as failure gives a
    page that retries forever.

  Needs DNS+TLS, so it goes through `net.rs` (libcurl), never `stream.rs`. Landed as
  `plex/discover.rs`, hanging off `AccountClient` so it reuses that transport rather than adding
  a fourth client.

## Appendix — full inventory

209 confirmed gaps. `severity`: blocker = a user cannot accomplish a core task; major = a feature every
Plex user expects; minor = noticeable but rarely load-bearing; polish = cosmetic. `effort`: small =
under ~150 lines in one file; medium = a new component or endpoint; large = a new screen or subsystem.

Note the three duplicate rows for the `app.rs:1409` regression — it was found independently by the
player, transport and tracks auditors, and is counted once in the themes above.

### Part 1 — Browse, detail, actions, account (vs. the official webOS client)

#### Home screen & global navigation

*Already implemented here: 22 reference features.*

- **PMS Search** — **closed 2026-09-01.** Search is the permanent fourth top destination,
  uses the television's native keyboard, and lands PMS results through its asynchronous worker.
  Plex Discover/catalog results and optional `sectionId` scoping remain outside that surface.

- **Library sections past the 4th were unreachable from Home** — **closed 2026-09-01.**
  The global row is `Home`, one pill per type, then `Search`; Movies and TV Shows name
  types rather than individual Plex sections. (Its VOCABULARY is permanent, its LENGTH is not: since
  2026-09-05 a type with no favourite library draws no pill, so the row holds two to four stops and
  a pill's index is not its identity — store a `Pill`.) The Library Source panel selects additional owned or
  shared sections of that type, so discovery no longer changes the row and no section is hidden by
  a tab cap.

- **Hero/preview region does not follow the focused card** — `major` / `medium`
  In the official client the hero is a preview of whatever card is focused: its art bleeds off the right, and title/episode/meta/summary/cast update as focus moves. Ours is an independent auto-rotating carousel over a curated pool, and the whole hero (art included) fades out as the grid rises, so browsing shelves happens against a flat gray background with no preview at all.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs (Backdrop/Hero to read the focused item when snap is in grid view, plus a cross-fade spring keyed on focus change) and rust-modules/src/pms.rs if the preview needs fields the hub payload lacks. Art already comes from /photo/:/transcode via posters.rs.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: home.rs:135-145 hero_item() reads pms::hero_pool_item (pool built pms.rs:300-322, capped HERO_MAX=8 at pms.rs:174), never the focused cell; home.rs:790-805 auto-flips on an idle timer; Backdrop::draw gates art on sp<0.996 (home.rs:279-288) and backdrop_art tints alpha 1.0-sp (home.rs:308-322); Env.hero_a = hero_alpha(sp,0.55) (home.rs:747) fades the whole hero group. Partial that DOES exist: the grid is not text-free — draw_focused stamps the focused tile's title plus a caption (home.rs:570-579), focused_caption gives 'S1 • E8'/year (home.rs:584-598) and cw_caption gives 'show · X m

- **No card context menu (long-press / OPTIONS) on home cards** — `major` / `medium`
  Official Plex TV clients open a per-card context menu from a long press or the OPTIONS key: Mark as watched/unwatched, Remove from Continue Watching, Go to show, Add to Watchlist. We have exactly one card action (OK), so a stale Continue Watching entry can never be dismissed and watched state can only be toggled from the detail page.
  *Where:* New rust-modules/src/ui/card_menu.rs on the shared Popover+TableView, a Route::CardMenu-style arm in rust-modules/src/app.rs, and one new client op in rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs: PUT /actions/removeFromContinueWatching?ratingKey= (scrobble/unscrobble already exist at library.rs:90-95).
  *Verified:* Confirmed, and the hook is explicitly reserved-but-dead. press.rs:144 is_long and press.rs:151 was_long BOTH exist with doc comments naming 'a future hold menu' (press.rs:5 and ui/CLAUDE.md:62 repeat it) and have zero callers anywhere in the tree. Worse than 'no menu': app.rs:2292-2294 currently treats a long press as a cancel — `} else if !press::is_active() { ok_armed = false; // long-press / cancelled — disarm without activating }` — so holding OK on a card today silently does nothing. No OPTIONS-style wcode is mapped (the wcode set lives in ui/consts.rs; app.rs's home arm has only the OK/p

- **Home loading/error/retry and off-thread hub fetch** — **closed 2026-09-01.**
  All Home sources now use `kick → worker → mailbox → commit`; profile activation and
  post-playback refresh only queue work. Home distinguishes Loading, Ready and Failed, retries
  without blocking the frame loop, and stale same-slot landings are rejected by client lifecycle,
  token generation, hub generation and sequence.

- **Watchlist is absent (adjacent catalog: plex.tv Discover)** — `major` / `large`
  The official rail carries Watchlist between Home and the libraries, plus an 'Add to Watchlist' action on items. This is a plex.tv Discover feature rather than a PMS library feature, but it is a first-class movie/show surface in the reference client. We have no watchlist state, screen, or API binding.
  *Where:* New rust-modules/src/plex/discover.rs (metadata.provider.plex.tv / discover.provider.plex.tv over net.rs's libcurl TLS transport, since stream.rs cannot do DNS/TLS) + a new rust-modules/src/ui/watchlist.rs screen and a rail entry in rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: case-insensitive grep for 'watchlist' over rust-modules/src returns nothing, and over docs/ nothing. plex/account.rs is only PIN create/poll (account.rs:60-80), GET /api/v2/resources (account.rs:83-90), GET /api/v2/home/users and POST .../switch (account.rs:92-110) — no discover.provider.plex.tv or metadata.provider.plex.tv client. One correction in the fix plan's favour: the TLS transport already exists and is already used for plex.tv — net.rs (libcurl) is what AccountClient rides on, precisely because stream.rs does no DNS/TLS — so a Discover client is a new module over an existin

- **No persistent left navigation rail** — `minor` / `large`
  The official client has an always-present left sidebar, collapsed to icons and expanding to labels on focus, holding avatar/username, Search, Home, Watchlist, libraries, Playlists, On Plex, Discover and More. We have a centered top pill row instead, and in grid view it is not reachable by D-pad at all: LEFT at column 0 is a no-op and UP at row 0 snaps back to the hero, so global navigation requires leaving the grid first.
  *Where:* New rust-modules/src/ui/nav_rail.rs as a shared View, replacing/absorbing widgets.rs:540 draw_tab_row; focus entry from rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs (Grid::nav LEFT edge) and rust-modules/src/ui/library.rs. No new endpoint.
  *Verified:* Still open. The centered `Home … Search` row — one pill per type that has a favourite
  library — is the global navigation; pointer access works from the grid, while D-pad access first
  returns through the hero. (On the Library, since the one-scroll rewrite, UP is the one-press route
  to the strip from any zone.)

- **Hero metadata line lacks air date, runtime and the time-left chip** — `minor` / `small`
  The official hero meta line reads 'S5 E25 - May 7, 2009 - 21m - TV-14 - [20 min left]', where the remaining time is a rounded chip. Ours reads either 'S1 E4 - Episode title' or 'Movie - YEAR - RATING'; no air date, no runtime, no content rating on the episode branch, and no time-left chip even though the item's resume point is already known (the Play pill switches to 'Continue' from it).
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs hero_content (meta assembly + a Badge chip from widgets.rs:726), rust-modules/src/pms.rs (add air date to PmsMovie + parse_item). No new endpoint - originallyAvailableAt/duration/contentRating already ride the /hubs payload.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: home.rs:356-377 builds the whole meta line — episode branch = 'S{n} E{n} · {ep title}', else '{Movie|Show} · {year} · {rating|NR}'. Substantial partials the note should carry. Runtime and time-left need NO new data or code: PmsMovie.dur_ns (pms.rs:17) and .resume_ms (pms.rs:27) are already populated, and fmt.rs:6 dur_short / fmt.rs:17 dur_long / fmt.rs:29 time_left already exist (time_left is used at home.rs:606 for the CW card caption). Content rating is already on PmsMovie (pms.rs:16) — the episode branch simply drops it. Only the air date needs plumbing: models.rs:132-133 origina

- **Hero has no cast line** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official hero prints a top-billed cast line under the summary ('Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski'). Our hero stops at the summary.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs hero_content, rust-modules/src/pms.rs (carry Role[] on PmsMovie). /hubs items often omit Role[], so this likely needs a lazy per-hero GET /library/metadata/{rk} through metadata.rs's existing off-thread mailbox.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: hero_content (home.rs:339-402) draws exactly title band → meta → synopsis; PmsMovie (pms.rs:12-37) has no roles and parse_item (pms.rs:90-150) never reads it.role. But the entire cast pipeline already exists one screen over, which lowers the lift: models.rs:172-173 Role: Vec<Tag> plus Tag.role (character) and Tag.thumb (headshot) at models.rs:276-278; metadata.rs:38-42 Cast struct; metadata.rs:343-347 maps Role[]→Cast; detail.rs:53/76 draws it as a circular CardRow row. And metadata.rs already has the off-thread detail mailbox (single-flight + generation guard, host-tested) to hang

- **No 'see all' on a shelf and no hub paging** — `minor` / `medium`
  Official shelves end in a 'see all' affordance that opens the hub's full listing, and hubs page beyond their inline items. We render only the inline Metadata[] each hub arrives with and drop the hub's own key/more/size, so a shelf can never be expanded or extended.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs (Hub.key/more/size), rust-modules/src/pms.rs (carry them on HubRow), rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs (trailing see-all tile + activation) reusing the Library grid; endpoint GET {hub.key} with X-Plex-Container-Start/Size.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: models.rs:101-111 Hub carries only type/hubIdentifier/title/Metadata — no key, no more, no size; HubRow (pms.rs:158-166) keeps title/hub_id/start/len; Grid::draw iterates 0..pms::hub_len(r) (home.rs:542) and nothing renders a trailing affordance (zero hits for 'see all'/see_all in the tree). One fact that sharpens the gap: the inline item count is capped by our own REQUEST, not by the server — pms.rs:234 calls client().home_hubs(12), so each shelf receives at most 12 items and the UI's MAX_ITEMS=24 never binds. Everything past item 12 of every hub is unreachable today, which makes '

- **'Movies & Shows on Plex' free catalog is absent (adjacent catalog)** — `minor` / `large`
  The official rail has an 'On Plex' entry for the free ad-supported movie/show catalog, browsable and playable without owning the media. Nothing in our client models a non-PMS content source.
  *Where:* New rust-modules/src/plex/discover.rs + a catalog screen alongside rust-modules/src/ui/library.rs, and a playback source branch in rust-modules/src/route.rs (its stream URL builder assumes a PMS part key).
  *Verified:* Confirmed: the data layer is one PMS Client keyed to host/port/token (plex/client.rs install/client, installed only from app.rs:349/412 and the auth take_ready path); every screen resolves items through pms.rs/browse.rs, which call only that client. route.rs's stream URL builder is built on a PMS part key + PMS session (plex/library.rs:115 direct_play_url), and the whole playback decision chain (transcoder.rs /video/:/transcode/universal/decision) is PMS-only. If anything 'large' understates it: beyond a catalog screen it needs a second content-source abstraction through route.rs AND an ad-sup

- **Discover top tabs (Trending / Activity / Find Friends / Profile) are absent (adjacent social surfaces)** — `minor` / `large`
  The official content area carries a top tab bar of Home | Trending | Activity | Find Friends | Profile, where everything but Home is a plex.tv Discover/social surface. Our top row is Home | Movies | TV Shows | Search.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs draw_tab_row (tab model) + new screens under rust-modules/src/ui/, backed by a new plex.tv Discover client (see the Watchlist gap).
  *Verified:* Still open: no Trending, Activity, Find Friends or Profile destinations exist. The
  local tab vocabulary is fixed and no longer coupled to the discovered section count.

- **Playlists have no representation** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official rail has a Playlists entry; video playlists are movie/show content. We drop playlist hubs on the home screen and have no playlist listing, screen, or client op.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs (GET /playlists?playlistType=video and GET /playlists/{id}/items), rust-modules/src/browse.rs (a playlist-backed listing) + a rail/tab entry and reuse of rust-modules/src/ui/library.rs's grid.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: pms.rs:235 const SKIP: [&str;6] = ["album","artist","track","photo","clip","playlist"] filters playlist hubs out of the home shelves (matched on hub.kind at pms.rs:249 and again per-item at pms.rs:268); the only other 'playlist' hit in the tree is the doc line at pms.rs:225. plex/library.rs's full public surface is sections, section_items, section_items_paged, section_items_query, section_directory, metadata, metadata_many, children, all_leaves, related, scrobble, unscrobble, select_streams, direct_play_url — no /playlists, no /playlists/{id}/items. minor/medium fair; browse.rs woul

- **No manual primary-server picker** — `minor` / `medium`
  Settings now exists and exposes Home sources, Privacy, Legal and About; the Library Source panel
  selects an owned or shared library of the current type. There is still no global control that
  promotes a different grant to the session's primary server: activation chooses owned-first and
  transport failure may only re-probe the same machine's endpoint. Playback preferences are tracked
  separately below.

- **Home hubs are not refreshed on foreground or a staleness timer** — `minor` / `small`
  Boot/profile activation, watched toggles and post-playback refresh now queue the same off-thread
  per-source fetch, so none blocks SDL. The remaining parity gap is scheduling: returning to Home,
  OS foreground, and elapsed staleness do not yet request a refresh.

- **Home shelf/item caps silently drop server content** — `minor` / `medium`
  **Partly fixed (issue #395):** Home's grid is a `Vec<CardRow>` sized to the published rows and the 16-shelf cap is gone, so every hub the server returns reaches Home; a shelf is published whole or not at all. What remains is the catalog's 256-card ceiling across all shelves: past it whole rows are dropped from the tail, never a partial row. Each shelf is also still capped at 24 cards. The official home scrolls every hub the server returns.
  *Audit as first written (the fixed `[CardRow; 16]` since replaced):* the grid was a fixed [CardRow; 16] with a 24-cell spring array.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs (Vec<CardRow> instead of the fixed array, or virtualize rows by visibility) and rust-modules/src/pms.rs (drop or raise PMS_MAX_MOVIES). No endpoint change; /hubs already returns them.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: home.rs:102-103 MAX_HUBS=16 / MAX_ITEMS=24 with n_hubs_of clamping the uncapped pms::hub_count (home.rs:106-114) and a host test asserting the clamp at home.rs:924-933; card_row.rs:21 MAX_ROW_ITEMS=24 with scale(i.min(MAX_ROW_ITEMS-1)) at card_row.rs:142-144; pms.rs:8 PMS_MAX_MOVIES=256 with the break at pms.rs:284-287. Three corrections to the priority. (1) MAX_ITEMS=24 never binds today — pms.rs:234 requests home_hubs(12), so the server only ever sends 12 items per hub; the real per-shelf ceiling is our own count param (this is the same root cause as the missing 'see all', gap #10

- **No watched checkmark badge on posters** — `polish` / `small`
  The official 'Recently Added' shelf stamps a checkmark badge in the corner of items already watched. We only draw the inverse cue (an amber angle for fully unwatched items) and nothing at all for watched ones.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs card() (badge branch) and rust-modules/src/pms.rs (derive a watched flag in parse_item from viewCount / viewedLeafCount, both already parsed). No new endpoint.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: widgets.rs:52-64 inside the shared card() composite is the only per-poster badge and draws Icon::UnwatchedAngle only when m.unwatched && m.resume_ms == 0; nothing marks a watched item. Icon::Check exists and is already rendered elsewhere — icons.rs:16/37, drawn by table.rs:304 (TableView row check) and library.rs:904 (the Unwatched toolbar chip's icon). Data partial, more favourable than the auditor states: for movies/episodes 'watched' is already derivable today as !m.unwatched, since pms.rs:117-120 sets unwatched = (view_count == 0) for kind 0/3. Only shows/seasons need new state

- **No live clock** — `polish` / `small`
  The official home shows the current time top-right ('6:39 PM'). Our top chrome carries only the profile chip and the tab track; the FPS counter occupies that corner instead.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/fmt.rs (a time-of-day formatter over libc localtime_r) + rust-modules/src/ui/home.rs home_draw (and ui/library.rs for parity). No endpoint.
  *Verified:* Confirmed: home_draw (home.rs:818-830) is Backdrop/Hero/Grid + draw_chip + draw_tab_row and nothing else on the top band; library.rs:894 draws the same row. fmt.rs:40 clock(ms) is the PLAYBACK clock ('1:23:45'/'3:45'), used by chapters_panel.rs:151 and player_hud.rs:29. No wall-clock read exists anywhere in rust-modules/src: no localtime/strftime/gmtime/SystemTime/UNIX_EPOCH hits; the only time reads are monotonic Instant (capture.rs, task.rs:150, player/threads.rs:58) and SDL_GetTicks. Confirming the auditor's corner note: app.rs:2462-2463 draws the dev FPS number at SCR_W-70, y=64 on every n

#### TV show / season / episode detail page

*Already implemented here: 19 reference features.*

- **No episode-level detail page — the hero always describes the show, never the focused episode** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client's episode page puts the EPISODE in the hero: episode title in bold, a metadata line "S5 E25 · May 7, 2009 · 21m · TV-14 · [20 min left]", the episode summary, and "Directed by …". Ours always renders the show container: `draw_hero` reads `metadata::current()` (which is the show), so the title, meta line ("TV Show · genre · genre · TV-14"), synopsis, date and runtime are all show-level, and they do not change when episode focus moves through the filmstrip. Per-episode text exists only as small captions under each still.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (`draw_hero`/`hero_layout`, plus a per-episode variant driven by `view().section == 2` focus); metadata.rs `Detail`/`Episode`. No new PMS endpoint needed — `/library/metadata/{rk}/children` already returns everything.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with one partial the auditor missed. The hero is not hard-wired to a show — draw_hero/hero_layout (ui/detail.rs:743, 508) render whatever metadata::current() holds, and an EPISODE Detail can be current(): fetch_detail (metadata.rs:311) fills kind="episode", show_title, season, index for a leaf, and the play paths call load_detail_now on the played leaf. app.rs:742-753 documents exactly this — 'backing out used to strand the user on an episode hero page' — and the fix was to route BACK through open_show_at_episode(show_rk, ...) instead. So a leaf hero renders today; it is just (a) un

- **Episodes carry no watched state — no checkmark badge, and no way to tell a watched episode from an unwatched one** — `major` / `small`
  The reference filmstrip puts an "E22"-style badge in the top-right of each thumb, with a checkmark inside it once the episode is watched. We draw a resume bar for partially-watched episodes only; a fully-watched episode looks identical to one never started. The data is simply not fetched: `Episode` has no `view_count`, and `fetch_episodes` never reads `viewCount` off the wire even though PMS sends it.
  *Where:* metadata.rs (`Episode` + `fetch_episodes`), ui/detail.rs `draw_episodes` (episode-number badge + checkmark overlay), optionally ui/widgets.rs `card()` so `Art::Thumb` gets the same shared progress language as `Art::Poster`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED exactly as described. Episode (metadata.rs:64-78) has no view_count/watched; fetch_episodes (metadata.rs:574-597) maps 13 fields and never touches x.view_count even though it deserializes at plex/models.rs:154-155. The only overlay on a still is the hand-rolled resume bar at ui/detail.rs:963-969, and widgets::card's Art::Thumb arm (ui/widgets.rs:64-72) has no marker path — the amber Icon::UnwatchedAngle is drawn only in the Art::Poster arm (ui/widgets.rs:49-62), gated on m.unwatched && m.resume_ms==0. Partial worth knowing: the semantics are already solved once, in pms.rs:116-119 (mo

- **No per-episode or per-season mark-as-watched — the only toggle scrobbles the entire show** — `major` / `medium`
  The hero's check disc calls `scrobble`/`unscrobble` on `metadata::current().rk`, which on a show page is the SHOW ratingKey — and PMS marks every leaf watched. There is no way to mark one episode (or one season) watched/unwatched, which the official client offers on the episode page and in the episode row's context menu. Marking a single episode watched today requires playing it.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (`on_ok` section 2 + a per-episode affordance/overflow action), reusing `plex::Client::scrobble`/`unscrobble` in plex/library.rs; the episode's own rk is already in `Episode.rk`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/detail.rs:1154-1174 is the only scrobble call site in the UI and it reads metadata::current().rk (the show on a show page); plex/library.rs:90-97 documents 'On a show/season it marks every leaf watched'. on_ok's section-2 arm (ui/detail.rs:1208) is bare `play_episode_at(col)`; sections 3/4 fall to `_ => false`. No long-press: ui::press::is_long (ui/press.rs:144) has zero callers in the whole crate (grepped — the only other hits are the doc lines in ui/press.rs:5 and ui/CLAUDE.md:62). Effort correction: the ACTION is trivial (Client::scrobble/unscrobble take any rk and Episode.rk

- **Play on a show starts S1E1, not the on-deck episode, and the button never says which episode it will play** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client's Play button resumes the next unwatched episode and is labelled accordingly ("Resume S3 E4"). Ours calls `play_episode_at(0)` — episode 0 of `cur_season`, and `fetch_full` always sets `cur_season` to `seasons[0]`. So opening a half-watched show and pressing Play restarts season 1 episode 1. The same path is what the Home hero pill fires for a show card. The pill label is the constant "Play" with no episode context and no resume/restart distinction.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (`on_ok` show arm + the Play button label) and metadata.rs (`Season` needs leafCount/viewedLeafCount from `fetch_seasons`, or `fetch_full` should land on the on-deck season). PMS: `/library/metadata/{rk}/children` already returns `leafCount`/`viewedLeafCount` per season (docs/pms-api.md §4).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and slightly worse than described. ui/detail.rs:1179-1181 is `if is_show() { play_episode_at(0) }`; fetch_full (metadata.rs:632-651) leaves cur_season at Default 0 and fills d.episodes from d.seasons.first(). fetch_seasons (metadata.rs:549-563) filters kind=="season" and preserves server order, so seasons[0] is whatever /children returns first — on a show with a Specials season (index 0) that is a SPECIAL, not even S1E1. Zero hits for onDeck/on_deck/viewedLeafCount-per-season anywhere outside plex/models.rs:151-153 and the show-level watched test at metadata.rs:330. Label is the con

- **No "play from start" / restart control** — `major` / `small`
  The reference action row's second circular button is restart (↺) — start the item from 00:00 even when a resume point exists. We have exactly two hero controls, Play and the watched toggle, and Play unconditionally applies the resume rule, so an item with a viewOffset can only be resumed from the detail page.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (`NBTN`, `draw_buttons`, `on_ok`, `set_resume` — a restart arm just passes 0); a `Restart`/`Replay` icon must be added to ui/icons.rs + assets/icons (the enum at ui/icons.rs:13 has no such mask).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent — grepped restart|Restart|from_start|play_from|Replay across the crate; the only hits are transcode-encode restarts (route.rs:225, player/engine.rs:447-460) and unrelated prose. ui/detail.rs:88 NBTN=2; draw_buttons (ui/detail.rs:824-849) draws exactly Play + the watched disc; both play arms call set_resume (ui/detail.rs:1191-1194, 1389) which applies metadata::resume_ns unconditionally, and last_resume_ns is the only value start_playback arms (app.rs:677-679). icons.rs:13-31 has 13 icons, none of them a replay/restart glyph, and assets/icons/ holds exactly those 13 SVGs. Sever

- **No ratings row — no critic/audience score badge anywhere** — `major` / `medium`
  The reference shows a TMDB logo badge with "86%" beside the metadata line. We display `contentRating` (TV-14) only; the numeric review scores PMS ships (`rating`, `audienceRating`, `Rating[]` with image ids like `imdb://image.rating`) are neither modelled nor drawn.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs (add `rating`/`audience_rating`/`Rating[]` with the lenient `de_f64`), metadata.rs (`Detail` + `fetch_detail`), ui/detail.rs `draw_hero` (a badge row under the meta line) — ui/widgets.rs:726 `badge()` already exists as the chip leaf.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/models.rs Metadata (lines 114-187) has content_rating but no rating / audience_rating / user_rating and no Rating[] struct; metadata.rs:210 Detail carries only `rating: String // contentRating`. Grepped userRating|audienceRating|rottenTomatoes|imdb|tmdb case-insensitively — zero hits in rust-modules/src. The only place contentRating surfaces is the hero meta line (ui/detail.rs:776-778), the About 'Rated' row (ui/detail.rs:1441) and the player Info card badge (ui/info_panel.rs:264-265). Severity correction: minor rather than major — it is a decorative badge, not a navigational c

- **No "More" (…) overflow menu — there is no context menu on the detail page at all** — `major` / `medium`
  The reference action row ends with a More (…) button; in the official client that menu holds Play Next / Add to Playlist / Go to Season / All Episodes / Version picker / Mark (un)watched / Refresh-Edit metadata. We have no overflow control and no long-press gesture, so none of those actions have anywhere to live — which is why several of the gaps below have no host either.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (an overflow CircleButton + a `Popover`+`TableView` menu, the same pattern ui/library.rs uses for its Sort/Filter menus); the `…` glyph must be added to ui/icons.rs.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/detail.rs:88 NBTN=2 and draw_buttons (824-849) draw only Play + the watched disc. ui/detail.rs imports exactly metadata, pms, card_row, consts, text_view, theme, widgets, the ui core, CString, c_int, ptr — no popover, no table; no Popover or TableView is constructed anywhere in the file. ui::press::is_long (ui/press.rs:144) is dead code. Client::all_leaves (plex/library.rs:79) is called from nowhere (grepped), so 'All Episodes' really is a data path with no UI. Effort correction: this is the cheapest of the structural gaps, not a true medium — ui/library.rs already builds Sort/Fi

- **Multiple media versions are invisible and unselectable — we always take Media[0]** — `major` / `medium`
  docs/pms-api.md §4 explicitly warns that an episode can carry several `Media[]` versions (its verified sample has a 4K HDR and a 1080p version) and that "the picker must iterate Media[] and choose by codec/resolution, not take [0] blindly". Every read in the detail/playback path takes the first. The official client shows the version in the media badges and lets you pick one from the overflow menu.
  *Where:* metadata.rs (keep a `Vec<Version>` on `Detail`/`Episode` instead of collapsing to one part/codec pair), ui/detail.rs (a version row or an overflow-menu entry), route.rs (accept the chosen part). No new endpoint — the versions are already in the same metadata response.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED — grepped every read of `.media`: metadata.rs:313 (detail), metadata.rs:579 (per-episode), metadata.rs:335/405/477 and route.rs:410 via Metadata::first_part (plex/models.rs:192-194 = media.first().and_then(part.first)), route.rs:271 (/decision), route.rs:302 (decision codecs), route.rs:407 (up-next), pms.rs:134 (catalog). Not one iterates media[]. Two things to add to the auditor's framing. (a) Playback is not actually broken by this: route.rs:260-290 asks the SERVER (mde_decision) and reads Part.decision, so PMS picks a version and the client honours the verdict — the gap is visibil

- **The detail page ignores the pointer entirely — Magic Remote clicks do nothing** — `major` / `medium`
  Every other screen handles `SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` (Home hero/cards/tab pills, Library, Account, Profiles, Login, the player HUD). `Route::Detail` has no arm, so on the primary LG input device you cannot click Play, click a season tab, or click an episode — only the wheel scrolls. There are no hit-test functions in ui/detail.rs at all.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (a `click(cx, cy) -> Action` mirroring ui/library.rs's, hit-testing the hero buttons, the `tabs_layout` strip, the episode row and the Related/Cast strips — all of their geometry already exists as single-source layout fns), plus a `Route::Detail` arm in app.rs's mouse-down chain.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and slightly broader than stated. The SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN chain (app.rs:1643-1780) branches on Player / Home / Library / Account / Profiles / Login — no Detail arm. But note MOUSEMOTION too (app.rs:1597-1642) has no Detail arm, deliberately ('Detail/Login hover used to silently mutate home's focus behind them', app.rs:1631-1632) — so Detail has neither click NOR hover-to-focus, unlike every other screen. app.rs:1809 (the wheel → UP/DOWN move_focus) is the only pointer input it accepts. ui/detail.rs defines no click/hit/pointer_focus fn at all (read the file end to end), unlike libra

- **No "Rate & Review" — the user cannot rate an item** — `minor` / `medium`
  The reference has a "Rate & Review" pill with a star icon that opens a rating/review composer. We have no user-rating read (`userRating`) and no write path; PMS's `GET /:/rate?key=&identifier=com.plexapp.plugins.library&rating=N` is not wired.
  *Where:* plex/library.rs (a `rate(rating_key, value)` alongside `scrobble`), plex/models.rs (`userRating`), ui/detail.rs (a rating control + a star-picker popover built on ui/popover.rs + ui/table.rs).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. Enumerated every `pub fn` across plex/*.rs: the only item-state writers are scrobble, unscrobble (plex/library.rs:90-97) and select_streams (plex/library.rs:104); there is no rate. Grepped userRating and /:/rate — zero hits. ui/detail.rs on_ok has arms for 0 (play/watched), 1 (season tab), 2 (episode play), 3 (related open) and `_ => false`; no rating arm, and no star icon in ui/icons.rs:13-31. minor/medium confirmed — note the write itself is ~4 lines next to scrobble; the medium is the star-picker UI, which would be the first Popover+TableView on this screen (see gap 8).

- **No media badges (resolution / audio format / subtitle) for the selected item** — `minor` / `medium`
  The reference's bottom-right shows "1080p", "🔊 STEREO EAC3", "⌨ English (SRT)" for the selected episode's streams. We surface audio languages as a wrapped text list in the About footer's Languages column and CC/SDH/AD chips in Accessibility, but there is no compact badge row, and crucially no VIDEO resolution at all — `videoResolution`/`width`/`height`/`audioChannels`/`bitrate`/`container` are not in the DTO.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs (`Media.video_resolution`/`width`/`height`/`audio_channels`), metadata.rs (`Detail`/`Episode`), ui/detail.rs (a badge row in the hero or under the focused episode) — ui/widgets.rs:726 `badge()` + `badge_w()` are the existing chip leaf.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED for the detail page, but there is a real partial the auditor did not name: the badge ROW already exists in the player. ui/info_panel.rs:263-277 draws contentRating, a Dolby/audio-codec tag (audio_badge from the codec), then CC / SDH / AD chips via meta_badge — i.e. the audio and subtitle halves of the reference row are already designed and shipped, just on the in-player Info card rather than the detail hero. What is genuinely missing everywhere is VIDEO RESOLUTION: plex/models.rs Media (197-205) carries only video_codec, audio_codec, Part[]; grepped videoResolution|video_resolution|a

- **No "Directed by" line, and no crew in the Cast & Crew row** — `minor` / `small`
  The reference prints "Directed by Randall Einhorn" under the summary, and the official Credits shelf mixes cast with directors/writers. Our Cast row is `Role[]` only; director, writer, studio and tagline are parsed by the DTO but never copied into `Detail` and never drawn.
  *Where:* metadata.rs (`Detail.directors`/`writers`/`studio`/`tagline` + `fetch_detail`), ui/detail.rs (`draw_hero` credit line and/or `draw_cast` merging crew after cast, `about_rows` for Studio).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/models.rs declares tagline (129), studio (131), Director (168-169), Writer (170-171) — and grepping director|writer|studio|tagline across rust-modules/src returns ONLY those four declarations plus unrelated 'directory'/'writer-of-a-static' prose. fetch_detail (metadata.rs:311-369) copies it.role into d.cast, it.genre, it.country and nothing else; Detail (metadata.rs:200-233) has no such fields. The Cast & Crew heading at ui/detail.rs:1096 is therefore a misnomer today — the row is Role[] only. minor/small confirmed; the row itself needs no work, since draw_strip's `extra` hook

- **Season tabs carry no episode or unwatched counts** — `minor` / `small`
  The official season selector shows how many episodes a season has and badges unwatched counts, so you can see at a glance where you stopped. Our `Season` model drops the counts PMS returns with each season row, so the tabs are label-only.
  *Where:* metadata.rs (`Season` + `fetch_seasons`), ui/detail.rs (`tabs_layout`/`draw_tabs` — ui/widgets.rs `badge()` or the existing `Icon::UnwatchedAngle` treatment for the count).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. Season (metadata.rs:80-84) is rk/index/title; fetch_seasons (metadata.rs:549-563) maps exactly those three off rows that already carry leaf_count/viewed_leaf_count (plex/models.rs:150-153), and docs/pms-api.md:241-242 shows the verified season row with "leafCount":8,"viewedLeafCount":0. tabs_layout (ui/detail.rs:439-451) builds the label from s.title or 'Season {index}' only. Partial: the DTO already deserializes both counts, so this is purely a dropped projection plus a label/badge change — widgets::badge (ui/widgets.rs:726) or Icon::UnwatchedAngle are both already available. minor

- **No resume progress or "N min left" chip on the detail hero** — `minor` / `small`
  The reference metadata line ends with a "20 min left" chip for the in-progress item. Our detail hero shows "date · run time" and nothing about how far in you are, even though the shared formatter exists and Home's Continue-Watching cards already use it.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs `draw_hero` (append a `fmt::time_left(d.dur_ms - d.resume_ms)` chip via ui/widgets.rs `badge()`), no data change — `Detail.resume_ms` is already populated (metadata.rs:328).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. fmt::time_left (ui/fmt.rs:29) has exactly one call site in the whole crate: ui/home.rs:606 (the Continue-Watching card). ui/detail.rs:794-806 builds the hero's date/runtime line from pretty_date + fmt::dur_long and nothing else. Detail.resume_ms IS populated (metadata.rs:328, resume_ms: it.view_offset) and is read only by set_resume (ui/detail.rs:1191-1193) — never drawn. Episodes do draw a resume BAR (ui/detail.rs:963-969) but no text. minor/small confirmed — genuinely a data-free change.

- ~~**No Extras / trailers shelf**~~ — **closed 2026-09-14.** Movie and show detail pages
  draw an Extras shelf of the `/extras` rows (trailers, behind the scenes, featurettes) after the
  episode strip and before Cast. Tiles are 16:9, captioned by subtype, and OK plays a playable
  extra. The Trailer disc is gone; a playable trailer autoplays in the hero after a dwell, and
  Play Trailer stays in the item menu. `Detail.extras` holds the rows; `Detail::trailer()` is
  the picker winner the preview and the menu both use.

- **Cast headshots are inert — no actor filmography** — `minor` / `large`
  In the official client a Credits tile opens that person's page (their other titles). Ours explicitly does nothing on OK, and `Cast` carries no tag id to query with.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs (`Tag.id`), metadata.rs (`Cast.id`), ui/detail.rs (`on_ok` section 4), and a results screen — the Library grid could host it via `section_items_query` with an `actor=<id>` filter (plex/params.rs `SectionQuery.filters` already takes arbitrary key/value pairs).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/detail.rs:1217 is literally `_ => false, // cast (4): headshots are not actionable`. Cast (metadata.rs:38-42) is tag/role/thumb; fetch_detail (metadata.rs:343-347) drops everything else off the Role[] entry, and plex/models.rs Tag (the struct with tag/role/thumb) has no id field to drop in the first place — so the gap starts at the DTO. SectionQuery.filters (plex/params.rs:38) is indeed `&[(String,String)]` appended verbatim, so an actor=<id> filter needs no new param plumbing. minor/large confirmed — the 'large' is the results screen, since ui/library.rs is entered by section in

- **No Watchlist button (adjacent-catalog / Plex Discover feature)** — `minor` / `large`
  The reference action row includes a bookmark = Add to Watchlist. This is a plex.tv Discover-graph action (`PUT https://discover.provider.plex.tv/actions/addToWatchlist?ratingKey=…`), not a PMS one, and nothing in the app talks to that host. Marked as an adjacent-catalog feature rather than a library feature.
  *Where:* plex/account.rs or a new plex/discover.rs (the Discover host + the watchlist add/remove actions, over net.rs's libcurl TLS path), plus a control in ui/detail.rs `draw_buttons`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. Grepped watchlist case-insensitively across rust-modules/src — zero hits. plex/account.rs's only plex.tv methods are new/create_pin/poll_pin/resources/home_users/switch_user (+ is_server/local_connection helpers); there is no Discover provider host anywhere, and the only non-PMS hosts in the crate are plex.tv's account endpoints. minor/large confirmed as an adjacent-catalog feature. One correction to the hosting note: net.rs's libcurl TLS path already exists and is what account.rs uses (the raw-socket stream.rs cannot do DNS/TLS), so a new plex/discover.rs would reuse it rather than

- **No Share button and no "Activity by You" row (adjacent-catalog / social)** — `polish` / `large`
  The reference has a Share (↥) action and an "Activity by You" row showing the user's avatar and their review/watch activity. Both are Plex's social/Discover graph, not PMS. Nothing of the sort exists here. Flagged as adjacent-catalog, not a library feature.
  *Where:* a new plex/discover.rs social client + a new section id and `draw_*` block in ui/detail.rs.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. No share/activity/review/social UI or client code anywhere in rust-modules/src. Section ids already include extras (6); the saved-column array is 7, indexed by section id. A Share row would still be a new section past that, and it is the lowest-value item in the whole list for a LAN PMS client.

- **Related posters show no watched/unwatched or progress state** — `polish` / `small` — **CLOSED 2026-08-21.** Both marks now draw. The audit below was right that the bar was "one argument away", and right that the disc was `Art::Poster`-only — but it read the shortfall as a missing FEATURE when it was a missing PARSE: `/related` returns the same wire DTO as every other listing, and `fetch_related` copied `{rk,title,thumb}` out and dropped `viewCount`/`viewOffset`/`duration`/`type`. So the fix was not to teach `Art::Thumb` the badges (which this entry and §699 both proposed, and which would have put a second, row-less mark path in `card()`); it was to make `metadata::Related` a real `pms::PmsMovie` through the shared `pms::parse_item`, after which `draw_related` passes `Art::Poster` + `resume_frac()` and inherits the ONE state language unchanged. It also closed the press-and-hold gap on the same shelf for free — see §5a. Duplicate entry at §699 below, closed with it.
  Home shelves and the Library grid draw the shared progress language (since 2026-08-13: amber corner disc = watched, amber bar = in progress, nothing = never started — it was an amber angle marking *unwatched* when this was written); the detail page's Related row draws bare thumbnails, so the same title looks different on two screens.
  *Where:* metadata.rs (`Related` + `fetch_related` keep viewCount/viewOffset/duration), ui/detail.rs `draw_related` (pass a resume fraction to `draw_strip`), ui/widgets.rs `card()` if the angle should reach `Art::Thumb`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with a useful partial: half the plumbing is already there. card_row::draw_tile (ui/card_row.rs:204) and draw_focused (226) both take `resume: Option<f32>` and call the shared resume_bar (ui/card_row.rs:313) — detail's draw_strip just hard-codes None at ui/detail.rs:1034 and 1045. So the in-progress bar is one argument away once the data exists. The unwatched ANGLE really is Poster-only (ui/widgets.rs:49-62, inside the Art::Poster arm), and Related passes Art::Thumb (ui/detail.rs:1075) because Related has no PmsMovie behind it. Related (metadata.rs:86-90) is rk/title/thumb and fetch_

- **No time-of-day clock** — `polish` / `small`
  The reference shows a clock in the top-right of the detail page. The app renders no wall-clock anywhere — `fmt::clock` is a playback-position formatter, not a time of day.
  *Where:* ui/fmt.rs (a `time_of_day()` formatter) + ui/detail.rs `draw()` top-right (and, for consistency, the other screens' chrome).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. fmt::clock (ui/fmt.rs:40) formats a playback position (h:mm:ss from ms), nothing more. Grepped localtime|strftime|SystemTime|UNIX_EPOCH|clock_gettime|gettimeofday|chrono|tm_hour across rust-modules/src — no wall-clock source is read anywhere in the app; the only time reads are SDL_GetTicks (monotonic) and Instant. ui/detail.rs draws nothing in the top-right band (the only pinned chrome is the centred compact title, ui/detail.rs:870-884). polish/small confirmed. NB `docs/agent-reference.md` records that this TV's wall clock is ~3h skewed in pmlog — worth checking the app's own view of local

#### Movie detail page — cast, reviews, extras, related

*Already implemented here: 17 reference features.*

- ~~**Extras shelf (trailers, behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, featurettes)**~~ — **closed 2026-09-14.**
  The detail page draws the shelf from `Detail.extras`. OK plays a playable extra through
  `request_play` with `continuous` omitted. A missing thumb is the card placeholder. The hero
  Trailer disc is gone: a playable trailer autoplays in the hero after a dwell, and Play Trailer
  stays in the item menu. Autoplay is direct-play only and does not write watch state.

- **Cast members are not actionable — no person page / filmography** — `major` / `large`
  In the official client a cast headshot is a link to that person's page (their filmography across your libraries). Ours is focusable and animates, but OK does nothing.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs (Tag.id + Tag.filter), rust-modules/src/metadata.rs (carry them onto Cast), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1217 (on_ok arm), plus a new person screen (new ui/person.rs + a Route variant in app.rs) fed by GET /library/sections/{k}/all?actor={tagId} (the same section_items_query already in plex/library.rs:31)
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/detail.rs:1217 is literally `_ => false, // cast (4): headshots are not actionable`; on_ok has arms only for 0/1/2/3. plex/models.rs:271-279 struct Tag parses tag/role/thumb only — no `id`, no `filter`, so the person identity is discarded at parse time. No Route::Person (app.rs:586-594 enum Route is Login/Profiles/Home/Account/Library/Detail/Player). PARTIAL: the tiles are real focus stops with springs (ui/detail.rs:1085-1112, shared CardRow with RowStyle::CAST), and the query plumbing already exists — SectionQuery.filters (plex/params.rs:39) takes arbitrary (key,value) pairs and

- **No critic / audience ratings anywhere on the page** — `major` / `medium`
  The official page shows the critic score and audience score (tomato/popcorn style badges with the numeric value) in the hero metadata block. We never fetch, model or draw any of it.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs (rating/audienceRating via de_f64, plus a Rating[] DTO {image, value, type}), rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:311 (fetch_detail), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:769 (hero meta line) and rust-modules/src/ui/icons.rs (the badge glyphs — Icon has no rating art today, ui/icons.rs:13)
  *Verified:* Confirmed. plex/models.rs Metadata (114-187) carries `content_rating` and nothing else rating-shaped; a crate-wide grep for audienceRating/audience_rating/Rating[] returns zero hits. metadata.rs:210 documents `rating: String // contentRating`, set from it.content_rating at metadata.rs:324; pms.rs:122 does the same for catalog rows. docs/pms-api.md:81 confirms `rating`/`audienceRating` are on the wire (0-10 floats, either may be absent) and :182 lists `Rating[]` among the arrays we do not consume. Effort correction: closer to SMALL than medium on the data side — `de_f64` already exists (plex/mo

- **The Play button never becomes Resume, and the hero shows no progress or time-left** — `major` / `small`
  The official hero reads "Resume" with a progress bar and a time-remaining line for a partially-watched movie, and offers Play-from-start beside it. Ours is a fixed "Play" pill with no resume affordance, even though the resume offset is already loaded and applied.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:824 (draw_buttons: label swap + a progress rail under the hero text, ui/fmt.rs:time_left for the caption). No new endpoint.
  *Verified:* Confirmed as a PRESENTATION-only gap, which the auditor undersells. ui/detail.rs:833 `Button::new(c"Play".as_ptr(), …)` is unconditional and NBTN=2 (detail.rs:88); draw_hero (743-822) draws title/meta/synopsis/date/buttons/Starring and no rail. But the BEHAVIOUR is already correct: detail.rs:1191-1194 set_resume feeds metadata::resume_ns(resume_ms, dur_ms) and app.rs seeks there, so pressing Play on a half-watched movie already resumes — it just lies about it. Both halves of the fix exist one call away: home.rs:425 does the exact label swap (`if hero.resume_ms > 0 { c"Continue" } else { c"Play

- **Watchlist button** — `major` / `medium`
  The official hero action row has Watchlist (add/remove) as a primary control. We have exactly two hero controls and no watchlist concept.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/account.rs (PUT/DELETE https://metadata.provider.plex.tv/actions/addToWatchlist|removeFromWatchlist?ratingKey={guid}, and the item's Guid[] must first be parsed in plex/models.rs — it is not), rust-modules/src/metadata.rs (Detail.on_watchlist), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:824 + :1148 (third control + on_ok arm)
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/detail.rs:824-849 draw_buttons draws exactly two controls (Play pill + Check disc) and detail.rs:88 NBTN=2; crate-wide grep for watchlist/Watchlist returns nothing. plex/account.rs exposes only new/create_pin/poll_pin/resources/home_users/switch_user (lines 29-104) — no metadata.provider.plex.tv surface. The Guid[] the watchlist API keys on is also unparsed (plex/models.rs Metadata 114-187 has no guid field; docs/pms-api.md:182 lists Guid[] as one of the arrays we ignore), so this needs a DTO addition before the mutation. crate::net (libcurl HTTPS) is indeed already the working p

- **Director / Writer / Producer credits are parsed but never surfaced — the "Cast & Crew" shelf has no crew** — `major` / `small`
  The official page lists directors and writers in the metadata block and mixes crew into the Cast & Crew shelf. We parse Director[] and Writer[] off the wire and then throw them away; our shelf is titled "Cast & Crew" but only ever contains Role[] actors.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:199 (Detail.directors/writers) + :311 (fetch_detail), then either rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1473 (an About "Directors"/"Writers" pair via the existing draw_pair) or :1085 (append crew tiles to the Cast row). No new endpoint — the data is on the response we already make.
  *Verified:* Confirmed. plex/models.rs:168-171 declares `director: Vec<Tag>` / `writer: Vec<Tag>`; a crate-wide grep for `.director`/`.writer` returns ONLY those declarations. metadata.rs:341-347 maps it.genre → genres, it.country → countries, it.role → cast and nothing else; Detail (metadata.rs:199-233) has no crew field. detail.rs:1096 hard-codes `c"Cast & Crew"` over a strip fed solely by d.cast (detail.rs:1101). Zero extra round-trips is correct — the data is already on the response fetch_detail parses. PARTIAL only in the sense that deserialization is done; nothing else is. Effort small is right; seve

- **No "More" (…) overflow menu on the detail page** — `major` / `medium`
  The official hero has a "…" button opening Play-from-beginning, Mark unwatched, Add to playlist, version/quality picker, Go to season, and admin actions. We have no overflow menu and no way to start a resumable item from the beginning.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs (a third hero control + a Popover/TableView menu, mirroring ui/track_menu.rs), rust-modules/src/app.rs (a Detail overlay route arm)
  *Verified:* Confirmed absent, but two menu items already ship as first-class controls: Mark
  watched/unwatched is the second hero control and now queues an asynchronous Home refresh; Go to
  season is the season tab row.

- **The detail page ignores the Magic Remote pointer entirely — no hover, no click** — `major` / `medium`
  Every other screen routes pointer motion and clicks (Home, Library, Profiles, Account, Player). On the detail page the pointer does nothing: the cast circles, Related posters, episode stills and the Play pill cannot be hovered or clicked. Only the scroll wheel is wired, and only to change section.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs (add `pointer_focus(x,y)` / `click(x,y)` deriving hit rects from the same ScrollColumn child_top + strip pitches the draw uses), rust-modules/src/app.rs:1622 and :1642 (two new Route::Detail arms)
  *Verified:* Confirmed exactly. app.rs:1623-1642 (SDL_MOUSEMOTION) dispatches to Profiles / Account / Library / Home only; app.rs:1709-1780 (SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN) to Player / Home / Library / Account / Profiles / Login — Route::Detail appears in neither. The only Detail pointer arm is the wheel at app.rs:1809-1810, mapped to move_focus(UP/DOWN). ui/detail.rs exports no pointer_focus/click (library.rs:628/692 are the only functions of those exact names; home/profiles/account_menu carry their own named hit-tests). Worth adding to the severity case: the remote-injection path synthesizes pointer clicks (app.rs:

- **Ratings and Reviews shelf (community reviews from plex.tv)** — `minor` / `large`
  The official page carries a shelf of community review cards — reviewer avatar + handle, date, a 5-star (half-star capable) rating, and ellipsis-truncated review text. We have no reviews of any kind, neither the plex.tv community graph nor the server-side critic Review[].
  *Where:* ADJACENT-CATALOG (Plex Discover / social graph), not a library feature. Local half: rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs (includeReviews=1) + rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs (Review DTO). Community half: a new plex/community.rs GraphQL client over crate::net (rust-modules/src/net.rs, libcurl HTTPS — already the plex.tv transport), a star-rating leaf in rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs, and a review-card block in rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs
  *Verified:* Confirmed. Crate-wide grep for review/Review hits only prose comments ('review-confirmed bug' in browse.rs:485, metadata.rs:569, library.rs:317, widgets.rs:528). No Review DTO in plex/models.rs; Client::metadata (plex/library.rs:59-65) never sends includeReviews=1; plex/account.rs stops at login/discovery/home-users (29-104) with no community.plex.tv client; ui/detail.rs:163-191 sections() has no reviews slot and ui/widgets.rs has no star leaf. The ADJACENT-CATALOG framing is right for the community half; the server-side half (includeReviews=1 + a Review DTO) is an ordinary library feature and

- **Tagline and Studio are parsed off the wire and never displayed** — `minor` / `small`
  The official page shows the film's tagline under the title treatment, and studio in the metadata block. We deserialize both and drop them on the floor.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:199 and :311 (carry them onto Detail), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:508 + :743 (tagline line in hero_layout/draw_hero) and :1428 (Studio pair in about_rows). Zero extra round-trips.
  *Verified:* Confirmed, and this is the cleanest partial in the batch: `pub tagline: String` (plex/models.rs:129) and `pub studio: String` (:131) are the ONLY two occurrences of either word in the entire crate — a crate-wide grep returns exactly those two lines. metadata.rs fetch_detail (311-370) never reads either, Detail (199-233) has no field, ui/detail.rs never draws them. docs/pms-api.md:181-182 confirms both ride the movie detail response we already fetch, so zero extra round-trips is correct. Targets are right: the hero y-chain is hero_layout (detail.rs:508-517) shared with draw_hero (:743), and the

- **The per-item color theme is lost on scroll, and never appears at all for an item outside the browse catalog** — `minor` / `small`
  The official page tints the WHOLE page from the artwork's dominant color, all the way down past cast and reviews. Ours paints the ambient wash only behind the hero, then overdraws it with the flat app gray as you scroll — and an item reached by Related or a deep link gets no tint at any scroll depth, because the colors are read from the browse-catalog row rather than from the loaded detail.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:199 + :311 (Detail.blur/has_blur from it.ultra_blur_colors), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:688 (draw_backdrop: fall back to the Detail's colors, and tint the scrolled surface instead of replacing it)
  *Verified:* Confirmed, with one correction. detail.rs:713-717 gates the ambient wash on `selected()` (detail.rs:142-148, a crate::catalog_fetch catalog lookup by index) having has_blur; mount_rk (detail.rs:1238-1244) sets selected = pms::index_of_rk(rk), which is -1 for anything not currently in a hub, so Related/deep-linked items get no wash. metadata::Detail (199-233) carries art and thumb but no blur/has_blur, even though plex/models.rs:185 parses UltraBlurColors and pms.rs:145-152 already converts it (with the all-black guard). detail.rs:737-740 blends theme::SURFACE_APP to full alpha as sf saturates, so the ti

- **The related response's multiple hubs are flattened into one nameless 20-item strip** — `minor` / `medium`
  PMS's /related returns SEVERAL titled hubs ("More with <actor>", "Similar Movies", "From the same director"…). The official client shows each as its own shelf under its own heading. We concatenate them into a single row labelled "Related" and discard every hub title.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:86 and :599 (group into Vec<(String, Vec<Related>)>), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:163 + :205 + :1053 (one ScrollColumn child per hub, one CardRow each). No new endpoint.
  *Verified:* Confirmed line for line. metadata.rs fetch_related loops the hubs, dedupes by rating_key into ONE flat Vec, never reads hub titles, and caps the strip. Effort correction: a new hub shelf needs a section id past extras (6). The fixed array is already 7 (`SPOT_SECTION_SLOTS`), indexed by section id, not visual order.
  *Partly closed 2026-09-28 (#205):* the `collection.related.*` hub is no longer flattened: it is its own shelf (section 7, `SectionId::Collections`, `SPOT_SECTION_SLOTS` now 8) under a linked heading with the collection's title, above Related, and Related no longer repeats its members. Every other hub is still flattened into the one "Related" strip.

- **Related posters carry no watch state — no unwatched mark, no resume bar** — `minor` / `small` — **CLOSED 2026-08-21; this is the same gap as the one above, audited twice.** Both marks draw now. See that entry for why the proposed fix here ("let the `Thumb` arm take the same badges") is the one that was *not* taken: the row, not the art variant, was what was missing.
  Everywhere else in the app a poster shows the amber unwatched corner or the amber resume bar. On the Related shelf the same posters are bare, so you cannot tell what you have already seen in the row the official client uses to keep you browsing.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:86 and :599 (carry unwatched + resume_ms/duration onto Related), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1053 (pass a resume fraction) and rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs:66 (let the Thumb arm take the same badges). No new endpoint.
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/widgets.rs:41-64 (Art::Poster) is the only arm that draws the amber UnwatchedAngle, and it keys off PmsMovie.unwatched/resume_ms; the Art::Thumb arm (widgets.rs:66-73) draws texture-or-placeholder and nothing else. detail.rs:1075 passes `Art::Thumb { key, res: (250,375) }` for Related. The `None` resume the auditor cites at detail.rs:1034/1045 is inside the SHARED draw_strip helper (detail.rs:1008-1048), which serves BOTH Related and Cast — so the fix needs a resume parameter threaded through draw_strip, not just a call-site change. Upstream, metadata.rs:86-90 Related keeps rk/ti

- **The About card's "MORE" affordance is dead — no way to read a truncated synopsis** — `minor` / `small`
  We draw a "MORE" label when the synopsis is cut off, and the card is a focus stop, but pressing OK on it does nothing. A long plot summary is unreadable in this client.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1148 (on_ok section 5, col 0) + a synopsis Popover built from the existing ui/popover.rs + ui/text_view.rs
  *Verified:* Confirmed. detail.rs:1561-1565 draws "MORE" whenever `syn.truncates(syn_w)`; detail.rs:1526-1538 gives the About card (col 0) a measured focus highlight and move_focus (detail.rs:366-408) makes it a real 2D focus stop; but on_ok (detail.rs:1148-1219) has NO arm for section 5 at all — it falls to `_ => false` at :1217, so neither the card nor the Information/Languages/Accessibility columns activate. The hero synopsis is likewise `.max_lines(4)` with no expansion (detail.rs:499, hero_synopsis). ui/popover.rs and ui/text_view.rs both exist to build the reader from. Effort small correct; the affor

- **No version picker when an item has multiple Media entries** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official client lets you choose which version/quality to play when a movie has more than one file. We silently take the first Media and never tell the user another exists.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:199 (Detail.versions: Vec<{part, vcodec, acodec, resolution, size}>), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs (a version row in the More menu) and rust-modules/src/route.rs (mediaIndex on the transcode/decision spec — plex/transcoder.rs:71 hard-codes mediaIndex=0)
  *Verified:* Confirmed, plus one site the auditor missed. plex/models.rs:192-194 first_part() = media.first().and_then(part.first); metadata.rs:313 `let media0 = it.media.first();` with part/vcodec/acodec taken from it at :335-337; route.rs:271, :302 and :407 all `.media.first()`; metadata.rs:579 does the same for episodes. Nothing anywhere indexes media[1..], and Detail (metadata.rs:216-218) stores a single flat part/vcodec/acodec triple. CORRECTION: mediaIndex=0 is hard-coded at TWO places in plex/transcoder.rs — :71 and :107 — not one, so the decision and the stream request both need the index threaded.

- **You cannot rate an item** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official client lets the signed-in user set their own star rating from the detail page (and shows it back). We neither read `userRating` nor expose a way to set it.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs (PUT /:/rate?key={rk}&identifier=com.plexapp.plugins.library&rating={0-10} — the Client::put helper already exists, plex/library.rs:109), rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs (userRating), rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs (star-rating leaf) + rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs
  *Verified:* Confirmed. Crate-wide grep for userRating/user_rating returns nothing; plex/models.rs Metadata (114-187) has no such field; plex/library.rs (all 120 lines) has no /:/rate — its write ops are scrobble (:90), unscrobble (:95) and select_streams (:104). ui/detail.rs has no star widget and ui/icons.rs:13-31 has no star glyph. The Client::put helper does exist and is already exercised (plex/library.rs:109). Auditor's endpoint and targets are right; effort medium is fair (the star leaf in widgets.rs is the bulk, the PUT is trivial).

- **Collections the item belongs to are never shown** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official detail page surfaces an item's collections as links into that collection.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs (`CollectionShelf`, from the member's `collection.related.*` hub), rust-modules/src/screens/detail/collection.rs (the linked shelf heading)
  *Verified:* Addressed by #205: the detail page's collection shelf links into the collection page. Member `Collection[]` tags are not deserialized — the shelf is fed by the `/related` collection hub, which names the collection by its tag id. Collection tag ids and collection ratingKeys are distinct; the collection store resolves a tag to its full collection row by tag id (`index`), then exact title.

- **Social action row (like, clap-with-count, more)** — `polish` / `medium`
  Under the reviews the official client shows a circular thumbs-up, a clap reaction with a count, and a "…" button. Nothing equivalent exists.
  *Where:* ADJACENT-CATALOG (Discover social). rust-modules/src/ui/icons.rs + assets/icons/ (new masks), rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs (a row of CircleButtons under the reviews block), riding the community.plex.tv client the reviews gap introduces
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/icons.rs:13-31 — the WHOLE Icon enum is Cc, Audio, Check, Chevron, ChevronDown, ChevronUp, Ring, UnwatchedAngle, Play, Pause, Info, User, Backspace; no thumb, clap, share or ellipsis mask (and src() at :33-43 maps each to a checked-in assets/icons/*.svg, so a new glyph means a new asset too). ui/detail.rs draw_child (662-685) dispatches exactly tabs/episodes/related/cast/about — no reaction row. No mutation surface exists (same missing community client as the reviews claim). ADJACENT-CATALOG framing correct; 'polish/medium' is right.

- **Share button** — `polish` / `medium`
  The official hero action row includes Share (send the item to a Plex friend / copy a link). Absent.
  *Where:* ADJACENT-CATALOG (Discover social). rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:824 + rust-modules/src/ui/icons.rs, plus a plex.tv sharing call in rust-modules/src/plex/account.rs
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/detail.rs:824-849 draws two controls (NBTN=2 at :88); no share code anywhere in a UI or plex context; ui/icons.rs:13-31 has no share glyph. plex/account.rs (29-104) has no sharing call. ADJACENT-CATALOG framing correct, 'polish/medium' correct.

- **A cast member with no headshot gets a blank placeholder circle** — `polish` / `small`
  The official client falls back to a person silhouette / initials. Ours draws an empty flat disc, so a crew-heavy or poorly-matched title reads as a row of grey holes.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs:66 (draw Icon::User into the empty Thumb placeholder, or add an Art::Person variant) — one file, no endpoint
  *Verified:* Confirmed. ui/detail.rs:1108 supplies `Art::Thumb { key: &d.cast[i].thumb, res: (300,300) }`; ui/widgets.rs:66-73 — when resolve_tex returns 0 the Thumb arm draws `p.rrect_sheened(r, rad, theme::CARD_PLACEHOLDER)` and returns, with no glyph. Icon::User does exist (ui/icons.rs:29, asset mapped in src()) and is already used for exactly this purpose one file over — the signed-out profile chip falls back to a person glyph (ui/widgets.rs:180). One file, no endpoint, correct. Small caveat on the fix shape: the Thumb arm is shared by the episode stills and the chapters strip (widgets.rs:88-92 draw_ca

#### Library browse grid, collections, categories, search

*Already implemented here: 14 reference features.*

- **No search anywhere in the app** — `blocker` / `large` — **being closed; see §1.1 for exactly how
  far.** This is the same gap as the Home-screen one above, filed twice by two auditors, and it is
  the one entry whose *Where:* was materially wrong: it prices "an on-screen alphanumeric keyboard,
  ideally promoted into `ui/widgets.rs` as a reusable Keyboard view" as the bulk of the work, and no
  such widget exists or should — the television owns the keyboard and `SDL_StartTextInput()` raises
  it (`docs/search.md` §3). Everything else it predicts is the shape being built, near enough: a
  `search.rs` store on the `person.rs` mailbox idiom, a `Route::Search` arm in `app.rs`, a strip
  entry in `ui/widgets.rs`, and the screen as `ui/search/` (a directory of five, not one
  `ui/search.rs`). Two of its capabilities are out of scope rather than pending: results are
  **server-only**, with no Plex-catalog hits (deliberate — see the adjacent-catalog entry below), and
  the `?sectionId=` scoping it mentions is not wired, so search is account-wide. Original finding,
  unedited:
  The official client has a full Search screen (sidebar entry) with an on-screen keyboard, searching the user's libraries plus Plex's own catalog, with results grouped by type (Movies, Shows, Episodes, People, Collections). We have no search UI, no search route, and no way to find an item by name — the only way to reach a title is to scroll the grid or the A–Z rail. The data call already exists and is dead code.
  *Where:* New `rust-modules/src/ui/search.rs` (screen + on-screen alphanumeric keyboard, ideally promoted into `ui/widgets.rs` as a reusable Keyboard view), a new `search.rs` async store beside `browse.rs`/`metadata.rs` (spawn_small + mailbox + generation, same idiom), a `Route::Search` arm in `app.rs` (key/pointer/draw), and a search entry in `ui/widgets.rs::draw_tab_row`. PMS endpoint: `GET /hubs/search?query=&limit=` (already implemented at plex/hubs.rs:23); `/hubs/search?sectionId=` scopes it to one library.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `Client::search` exists at plex/hubs.rs:23-29 (`GET /hubs/search?query=&limit=`) and is dead code — `rg -n "search" rust-modules/src` yields only that definition, the plex/mod.rs:13 admission ("the ops written ahead of a UI feature (search/browse/leaves — no callers yet)"), and unrelated byte/binary-search helpers in stream.rs:37, text.rs:327/357, remote.rs:76/119/138, plus `av_opt_set`'s `search_flags` param name in ff.rs:272. app.rs:586-594 `enum Route` = Login/Profiles/Home/Account/Library/Detail/Player{overlay} — no Search arm, and no Search entry in `modal_of` (app.rs:608). ui/

- **Collections: no filter facet and no detail-page link yet** — `minor` / `medium` — **in progress under #205.**
  The official Library screen shows a section's collections as poster cards that drill into the collection's children, its type dropdown offers Collections, and a movie's detail page links to its collection. What now exists: `plex/collections.rs` has typed reads for `GET /library/sections/{k}/collections` (`section_collections`), a collection's own metadata (`collection`) and its members (`collection_children`), each returning a `CollectionOutcome` that keeps a denied section, a missing collection and a transport failure apart. A collection row parses to its own `KIND_COLLECTION` kind, so it never opens a fake Detail page, offers Play, or scrobbles (#270). The Library's TYPE menu offers Collections for movie and TV libraries (`all?type=18`, the poster grid, an "N items" caption, a neutral glyph-and-name tile for a collection without artwork), and OK on a collection card opens the collection page.
  Still missing: a `collection=<tag>` facet in the filter menu, and the detail-page link from a movie to the collections it belongs to (see "Collections the item belongs to are never shown" above, which covers that half).
  *Where:* the filter menu (`screens/library/menu.rs`) and Detail.
  *Verified:* `LibraryType::offered` lists Collections for both section kinds and `LibraryType::plex_type` sends `type=18`; the filter menu still offers only Unwatched and Genre.

- **No "Categories" browse (by genre / year / director / actor / country / content rating)** — `major` / `large`
  The official client's Categories tab is a browsable index: pick an axis (Genre, Year, Decade, Director, Actor, Country, Content Rating, Studio, Resolution…), see the values as tiles, drill into one to get the filtered grid. We only ever fetch ONE axis (`genre`) and only as a flat single-select filter list — there is no category browse view, and no other axis is reachable at all.
  *Where:* `browse.rs` (generalize `GenreEntry`/`genre` into a `(facet_key, value_id)` list and reuse `kick_directory` for any directory name), `ui/library.rs` (a Categories sub-tab: an axis list → value tiles → the existing grid with the filter applied), `plex/library.rs::section_directory` already covers the PMS side (`GET /library/sections/{k}/{genre|year|decade|director|actor|country|contentRating|studio}`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `kick_directory` (browse.rs:350-383) is fully generic over the directory name, but `rg` shows exactly two callers: `kick_genres` with "genre" (browse.rs:404-410) and `kick_letters` with "firstCharacter" (browse.rs:436-441). `SecState` (browse.rs:56-76) holds a single `genre: Option<GenreEntry>` + `genres: Vec<GenreEntry>` — one axis, one value, single-select (browse.rs:339-344 REPLACES it). ui/library.rs:67-73 `enum Menu { None, Sort, Filter, Genre }`; the filter menu's only drill-down is Genre (ui/library.rs:545-561, 563-586). `plex::Client::section_directory` (plex/library.rs:51-5

- **No per-section "Recommended" tab (the section's own hub rows)** — `major` / `large` —
  **the SHELVES closed 2026-09-05; the VIEW MODE is what is still open.**
  The library's own published hubs are fetched and drawn now: `plex::Client::library_hubs` →
  `GET /hubs/sections/{key}?count=`, `browse/section_hubs.rs` as the per-section store (a field on
  `SecState`, with a Fetching/Staged/Committed publication axis so a late landing cannot move a grid
  the user is looking at), and `ui/library.rs` drawing them through the shared
  `ui/card_row.rs` `CardRow` — in the owner's own *Manage → Libraries* order, verified against a
  live server (`docs/pms-api.md` §3a). They are ABOVE the grid in ONE continuous scroll rather than
  behind a second tab, which is a deliberate product ruling and not an omission: two screens is two
  scroll positions and two BACK meanings for one library. What remains open is Plex's
  Recommended/Library/Collections/Categories VIEW-MODE axis and the category browsing under it.
  *Where (still):* the categories half — `browse` generalising its single genre facet, and a
  value-tile level in `ui/library.rs`.
  *Verified as of 2026-09-05:* `plex/hubs.rs` has five ops, the fifth being `library_hubs`;
  `ui/library.rs`'s `enum Area` is eight variants including `Shelf`, built by `zones(&Layout)`;
  `enter()` no longer parks in `Area::Grid` but at the document's first content zone.
  **The paragraph below is the original 2026-07 finding, kept as the record of what was true then.**
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `rg -n "hubs/sections"` → zero matches. plex/hubs.rs has exactly four ops (home_hubs `/hubs`, continue_watching, promoted, search); none is section-scoped, and `home_hubs(12)` at pms.rs:234 is the ONLY hub fetch in the app. ui/library.rs:57-66 `enum Area { Tabs, Toolbar, Grid, Rail }` — no view-mode axis; `enter()` (ui/library.rs:178-191) always sets `AREA = Area::Grid`. PARTIAL worth noting: the global `/hubs` response already carries per-library shelves that Home renders — pms.rs:306-308 documents the identifiers it matches (`home.movies.recent`, `home.television.recent`, `promote

- **The filter menu exposes exactly one facet (Genre) out of the server's ~27** — `major` / `medium`
  The official filter dropdown offers the section's full server-defined `Filter[]` list — Year, Decade, Content Rating, Resolution, HDR, Studio, Director, Actor, Writer, Country, Label, Collection, Unplayed/In Progress, Added-since, and so on — with multi-select and value operators. Movies and TV Shows offer "Unwatched only" and single-select "Genre"; Seasons and Episodes offer "Unwatched only". The DTO layer doesn't even parse `Meta.Type[].Filter[]`, so the server's menu is discarded on arrival.
  *Where:* `plex/models.rs` (add `Filter { filter, filterType, key, title }` to `MetaType`), `browse.rs` (replace the single `genre` slot with a `Vec<(facet, value_id, title)>` and emit each as a query pair; `kick_directory` already fetches any value list generically), `ui/library.rs` (a generic facet menu level between Filter and the value list, plus multi-select rows). Endpoint: the existing `section_items_query` filters vec + `section_directory`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and the DTO layer explicitly defers it. plex/models.rs:83-88 `MetaType` parses only `active` + `Sort[]`, with the doc comment at :80-82 saying verbatim "The wire also carries a `Filter[]` menu — docs/pms-api.md §2b — modelled again when the v1.5 facet menu consumes it; DTOs here keep only consumed fields." browse.rs:583-595 reads only `t.sort` off the landed `Meta`; browse.rs:550-559 builds `filters` from exactly two sources (the unwatched flag → `unwatched`/`unwatchedLeaves`, and `st.genre` → `genre`); browse.rs:339-344 `set_genre` is single-select by construction. ui/library.rs:54

- **Libraries past the fourth were unreachable** — **closed 2026-09-01.**
  Movies and TV Shows are permanent type destinations; every matching library remains selectable
  through the Source panel. There is no longer a one-pill-per-section cap.

- **Adjacent catalog: no Plex Discover / "Movies & Shows on Plex" and no Watchlist** — `major` / `large`
  The official client's sidebar carries the free ad-supported Movies & Shows catalog and the user's Watchlist, and its search returns catalog + Discover results alongside server results. We have zero support: no discover.provider.plex.tv client, no watchlist read/toggle, and our search op (unused anyway) is server-only. Flagged as an adjacent-catalog feature, not a library one.
  **Still open, and the half of the search story that stays open even once §1.1 closes**
  (2026-08-14): the Search screen is server-only **by decision**, not by omission — "unused anyway"
  stops being true the moment `search.rs`'s fetch lands, but "server-only" does not.
  Catalog + Discover hits need DNS and TLS and
  therefore `net.rs`/libcurl, their own client, their own store and their own failure modes; adding
  them is a separate feature, not a wider `limit=` on `/hubs/search`. `docs/search.md` §6.
  NB the partial that does exist: `plex/discover.rs` was added for person bios (see *Superseded by
  owner decisions*), so the transport question is already answered — what is missing is the catalog
  and watchlist surface, not a way to reach plex.tv.
  *Where:* Extend `plex/discover.rs`'s `DiscoverClient` beside `plex/account.rs` (HTTPS via
  `net.rs`/libcurl; `stream.rs` is the plaintext raw-socket arm), add a Watchlist store, and add a
  new `ui/` screen plus `Route` arm in `app.rs`. Endpoints:
  `https://discover.provider.plex.tv/library/sections/…`,
  `https://metadata.provider.plex.tv/library/search`, and `PUT/DELETE`
  `https://discover.provider.plex.tv/actions/addToWatchlist`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `rg -ni "watchlist|discover|provider\.plex\.tv"` over rust-modules/src returns zero watchlist hits and zero provider hits; every `discover` hit is LAN server discovery or an unrelated comment — auth.rs:3/25-26/295/297/307/314/375/462 (`Phase::Discovering`, `discover_and_store`), plex/account.rs:1/10/83, plex/session.rs:2/45, browse.rs:29/201, app.rs:354/2299, lib.rs:8. plex/mod.rs:27 confirms `account.rs` is the ONLY non-PMS surface (plex.tv login / server discovery / home-users), and plex/hubs.rs:23-29 `search` goes through `Client::get_json`, i.e. the local PMS host. Severity/effo

- **Folder views remain unavailable** — `minor` / `medium`
  Libraries offer a Type selector in All: TV libraries list TV Shows, Seasons, Episodes and
  Collections; movie libraries list Movies and Collections. The query sends `type=2|3|4|18` (a
  movie library's films stay untyped), reloads the selected type's sort options, and displays
  episodes as landscape stills. Folder views remain open; they are not an option in this selector.
  *Where:* `browse::LibraryType`, `screens/library/menu.rs`, and `screens/library/layout.rs`.

- **The grid's watched/progress state goes stale after playback — its per-owner retained listing publication is not refreshed** — `minor` / `small`
  Play a movie from the Library grid, finish it, press BACK: the poster can still show the amber unwatched angle and no resume bar because playback invalidates the Bridge-owned section-hub shelves, not that owner's retained listing publication. The official client's grid reflects watched state the moment you return.
  *Where:* add an explicit owner operation that refreshes only the current listing while retaining its sort/genre/letter/focus state, then call it from the post-playback and watched-toggle paths. Alternatively re-fetch just the touched item via the existing `plex::Client::metadata`.
  *Verified:* Still open. `app/run.rs` calls `Bridge::browse_run(BrowseCmd::HubsInvalidateAll)` after playback, which invalidates every owned section-hub shelf; it does not replace the `ListingView` in that Bridge's retained `BrowsePublications`.

- **No context menu on a grid poster (mark watched/unwatched, play, go to show)** — `minor` / `medium`
  On the official client, holding OK (or the options button) on a grid poster opens a context menu — Play, Mark as Played/Unplayed, Go to Show, Add to Watchlist. Ours has exactly one activation: OK opens the detail page. The long-press machinery exists and is measured, but nothing in the app ever asks for it.
  *Where:* `ui/library.rs` (a `Menu::Context` state reusing the existing `Popover` + `TableView` the sort/filter menus already use, and a long-press branch in `on_ok`/the press commit), `app.rs` (a new `Action` arm). PMS side is already there: `plex/library.rs:90-97` `scrobble`/`unscrobble`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/press.rs:144 `pub fn is_long(now: u32) -> bool` has ZERO call sites — `rg -n is_long` returns only the definition, the module doc at ui/press.rs:5, and the ui/CLAUDE.md mention. Activation map: ui/library.rs:442-473 `on_ok()` returns a bare `Action::Card` for `Area::Grid` (and `click()` at :718-720 does the same), app.rs:2284/1746 routes it to `open_library_card` (app.rs:641-649) which always opens Detail. ui/library.rs:75-81 `enum Action { None, GoHome, Card }` — no third verb. There is also no OPTIONS/context key to bind: ui/consts.rs:44-51 defines only CH▲/CH▼ (33/34) and PAUS

- **Filter selections are not persisted across app restarts** — `minor` / `small`
  The official client remembers each library's sort and filter between sessions. Ours now remembers
  the SORT (key and direction, per profile, per library — `Session::library_sorts`, GitHub #278),
  but keeps the filters only in the Bridge-owned BrowseStore's in-memory state: quit the app (or
  switch profile and back) and every section is back to no genre, unwatched off.
  *Where:* `rust-modules/src/browse/mod.rs` — extend `note_sort_choice` / `restore_for` (and the
  `LibrarySorts` record in `plex/session.rs`) with the unwatched flag and genre id; a genre id
  must be re-validated against the section's genre list before it is sent, exactly as a
  remembered sort key is re-validated against the menu.
  *Verified:* sort persistence is graded by `browse::sort_memory_tests` (a loopback PMS, a cold
  session cache read back from disk, a fresh store). Nothing persists `unwatched` or `genre`.

- **No way to enter the grid with a preset query (a hub's "See All")** — `minor` / `medium`
  In the official client every hub row has a "See All" that opens the library grid pre-sorted/pre-filtered to that hub (Recently Added → the grid sorted by addedAt desc). Our grid can only ever be entered at whatever query the section last remembered — the owned Library uses a `SectionAddress` and `BrowseCmd::Addressed` for its own controls, but no external hub action supplies a preset query.
  *Where:* `rust-modules/src/stores/browse.rs` (`SectionAddress`/`LibraryWork::Commit`), `rust-modules/src/screens/library/`, and the missing hub-heading activation in the owned Home/app path.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. The Browse command vocabulary can apply sort/filter edits emitted by the Library itself, but no `See All` effect or preset-query entry point exists from a hub. The retained per-Bridge state restores only what that BrowseStore already remembered during its lifetime; it does not provide a hub-specific preset. A tree-wide search finds no `See All` implementation.

- **Grid posters carry a title/year only while focused** — `polish` / `small`
  The reference grid labels every poster with an ellipsized title and the year underneath. Ours draws bare posters and puts the title + year only under the single focused card, so scanning an unfamiliar library means walking focus cell by cell — noticeably worse for shows whose posters don't carry the name.
  *Where:* `ui/card_row.rs` (a `RowStyle` flag or a `draw_tile` variant that renders the under-label at rest ink) + the pass-1 loop in `ui/library.rs:832-847`; the strings must be cached per visible cell rather than rebuilt per frame (the CString/`text::elide` cost is why only one card does it today).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/library.rs:827-848 (pass 1) calls `card_row::draw_tile` for every non-focused visible cell; ui/card_row.rs:204-214 `draw_tile` draws only `card(...)` + an optional `resume_bar` — no text path exists in it. Title + year are built and drawn only in pass 2 for `focused_i` (ui/library.rs:854-871 → `card_row::draw_focused`, ui/card_row.rs:220-256, whose doc says "only the FOCUSED item carries metadata"). `PITCH = CARD_H + 96.0` (ui/library.rs:53) does reserve the band. Caveat on framing: this is the house style shared with Home (both pass `&RowStyle::HOME`), not an oversight local to

- **The Sort chip doesn't show the sort direction** — `polish` / `small`
  The toolbar chip reads "Sort · Title" with a static dropdown chevron, so ascending vs descending is invisible until the menu is opened — and since re-picking the active row silently flips direction, a user can toggle it and see no change in the bar at all.
  *Where:* `ui/library.rs::draw` (pass `if browse::sort_desc() { Icon::ChevronDown } else { Icon::ChevronUp }` for chip 0, and add `sort_desc` to the `CHIP_CACHE` staleness key at ui/library.rs:750 so the cached width/strings invalidate on a flip).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/library.rs:900 passes a literal `Icon::ChevronDown` for chip 0 regardless of state, and `chip_strs()` (ui/library.rs:745-767) builds the label from `browse::sort_label()` only, with the staleness key at :750 being `(sort_label, filter_label, section)` — `browse::sort_desc()` (browse.rs:288-290) is read nowhere in the chip path (its only readers are ui/library.rs:531, the open menu's active row, and browse.rs:547, the query string). Small correction to the detail: flipping direction is not entirely invisible — `set_sort` (browse.rs:307-313) toggles and calls `requery()`, so the GR

#### Item actions & context menus (the long-press / "More" menu)

*Already implemented here: 14 reference features.*

- **There is no item context menu at all (long-press / "More")** — `blocker` / `large`
  The official client's core interaction in this domain — hold OK on any card to get a full-screen modal titled with the item plus "S2 · E2", then a vertical stack of full-width rounded action buttons — does not exist anywhere in the app. Nothing renders a per-item action list, and no key path can reach one. The long-press is already *detected* but deliberately dead: press.rs:44-47 says "the press-and-hold MENU will hook in at this threshold later ... until it exists a long press is deliberately a no-op rather than a launch", press.rs:169-176 latches want_commit=false at 500ms, and app.rs:2298-2299 then just disarms (`else if !crate::ui::press::is_active() { ok_armed = false; // long-press / cancelled — disarm without activating }`). Every action in the reference vocabulary is therefore either missing outright or reachable only from one hard-coded button on one screen.
  *Where:* New ui/item_menu.rs (Popover + TableView, modelled on ui/account_menu.rs's list→Action pattern); hooks: ui/press.rs (fire on the LONG_MS latch instead of no-op), app.rs (a new `Route::ItemMenu` arm beside Route::Account, plus a call at the press-tick branch app.rs:2298 and in home_activate/open_library_card/detail::on_ok); the actions themselves land in plex/library.rs. No new PMS endpoint for the shell itself.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and the auditor's evidence is exact. press.rs:47 LONG_MS=500; the latch at press.rs:173-176 sets want_commit=false + long=true; is_long (press.rs:144) and was_long (press.rs:151) have ZERO call sites — I re-grepped the whole repo and only press.rs, ui/CLAUDE.md:62 and docs/simplification-audit-2026-07-18.md:71/:98 mention them (that audit explicitly kept them as deliberate forward-looking scaffolding). app.rs:2293-2294 disarms without activating. I also read the ENTIRE key handler (app.rs:1097-1595): there is no MENU/OPTIONS wcode arm anywhere — the only wcodes handled are OK, PAUSE

- **"Remove from Continue Watching" is impossible** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client lets you drop an item off the Continue Watching shelf without marking it watched. We have no such call and no local hub-item removal: the only way to clear a CW row is to mark the whole item watched from its detail page (which changes watch state, not just the shelf).
  *Where:* plex/library.rs (new `remove_from_continue_watching(rating_key)` → PUT /actions/removeFromContinueWatching?ratingKey={rk}, the modern PMS verb; /:/unscrobble is the fallback), pms.rs (an optimistic local hub-row drop so the shelf updates before the asynchronous refresh lands), ui/item_menu.rs for the row.
  *Verified:* Still open: there is no removal verb or optimistic per-row mutation. The existing
  fallback is a queued full per-source Home refresh.

- **No "Play from Start" anywhere outside the player, and the detail Play button silently resumes** — `major` / `small`
  The reference offers Resume and Play from Start as two distinct rows. Our detail hero has exactly two controls (Play + the watched disc), the Play label is the hard-coded literal c"Play" regardless of resume state, and it always applies the resume rule — so an item with a viewOffset can only be resumed, never restarted, until you are already inside playback and open the Info card. The home hero does relabel to "Continue" but likewise offers no restart.
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs (NBTN/draw_buttons/on_ok — relabel to Resume + add a start-over control or route it through the new item menu), ui/item_menu.rs (the Resume / Play from Start rows), app.rs's start_playback call sites which already take a `resume_ns` argument (pass 0). No new PMS endpoint.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim. detail.rs:88 NBTN=2; detail.rs:833 is the literal `Button::new(c"Play".as_ptr(), …)` with no resume branch (grep of detail.rs for Continue/Resume finds only comments at :29/:1156); detail.rs:1191-1194 unconditionally set_resume(d.resume_ms, d.dur_ms), and the episode path does the same at detail.rs:1389 (set_resume(ep.resume_ms, ep.dur_ms)) — so an episode can't be restarted either. home.rs:425 does relabel (`if hero.resume_ms > 0 { c"Continue" } else { c"Play" }`) but offers no restart. The lone restart is info_panel.rs:49 "From Beginning", and note it is a request_seek(0)

- **"Go to Show" has no route from a Continue Watching card** — `major` / `medium`
  **Design note (owner, 2026-07-29): resuming on OK is INTENTIONAL** — a CW tile plays straight away and the amber play badge on the card is the affordance that announces it. Do not "fix" `home_activate` to open detail. The gap is the *other* half: **long-press should open the item menu, with "Go to Show" as its headline action.** The context menu is also the official client's route to "Mark as Watched" etc. Until it exists, a CW tile can only be resumed — the show/movie page, the synopsis, a different episode and the watched toggle have no route from that shelf.
  *Where:* `ui/item_menu.rs`; its `Action::GoToShow` is applied by `app/input.rs::apply_item_action`, which calls `nav_open(to_detail(...), season)` for key and pointer activation alike.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED with one correction that narrows the gap. app.rs:931-933 is exact: `want_play = hf == 0 || (!hero_view && (pms::hub_is_continue(row) || mm.kind == 3))` — so EVERY tile in the CW shelf (movies included) and every episode tile in any shelf plays on OK, and home.rs Grid renders no per-card info affordance. CORRECTION: the CW items are ALSO the front of the rotating hero pool (pms.rs:301-325 seeds the pool from hub_id=="home.continue" first, then "recent", capped at HERO_MAX=8, skipping seasons and art-less items), and the hero's Info disc (hf==1) DOES reach the detail page — app.rs:956-

- **Mark Watched/Unwatched only works on the whole loaded detail item — never per episode, never from a grid** — `major` / `medium`
  Our only watched toggle is the detail hero's disc, and it acts on `metadata::current()` — which on a show page is the SHOW, so scrobbling marks every leaf. Individual episodes in the detail episode row cannot be marked watched or unwatched (OK on an episode only plays it), and no home or library grid card can be marked at all. The official client offers Mark as Watched on any card, episode included.
  *Where:* ui/item_menu.rs (the row), ui/detail.rs (episode-row context action + an Episode.watched field parsed in metadata.rs's episode fetch), ui/home.rs / ui/library.rs (context menu on a grid card), plex/library.rs:90/:95 scrobble/unscrobble already take any rating key.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with a useful partial: the DATA layer already carries per-card watched state, only the toggle is missing. pms.rs:36 `PmsMovie.unwatched` is parsed for every catalog item including episodes (pms.rs:115-119, viewCount for movie/episode, viewedLeafCount for show/season) and widgets.rs:50-53 already DRAWS the unwatched dot on home and library grid cards — so grid cards display watch state they cannot change. What is genuinely unmodelled is the detail EPISODE row: metadata.rs:64-78 `struct Episode` carries resume_ms but no watched/view_count field (detail.rs:963-965 draws only a resume b

- **No Watchlist (add / remove) — and no Plex Discover integration at all** — `major` / `large`
  "Remove Show from Watchlist" is row 6 of the reference context menu. We have no watchlist state on any item, no add/remove call, and no plex.tv Discover surface whatsoever (the adjacent free ad-supported catalog and the social graph). Our plex.tv client covers only pins, resources and Home users. NOTE: the Discover catalog half is an adjacent-catalog feature, not a library feature; the Watchlist rows are the part the context menu needs.
  *Where:* plex/account.rs (PUT/DELETE https://discover.provider.plex.tv/actions/addToWatchlist|removeFromWatchlist?ratingKey={guid} over crate::net's libcurl HTTPS — the PMS raw socket can't do TLS/DNS), plex/models.rs (add `guid` + a userState block), metadata.rs (carry the flag onto Detail), ui/item_menu.rs (the row).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/account.rs is exactly create_pin(:73)/poll_pin(:79)/resources(:88)/home_users(:96)/switch_user(:104) against https://plex.tv (:17) — nothing else; grep for watchlist/discover/userState/guid/slug over rust-modules/src returns only server-DISCOVERY comments in auth.rs/plex/session.rs and browse.rs's section discovery. plex/models.rs:113-190 Metadata has no `guid`, no `userState`, no `watchlistedAt`, so the client cannot even tell whether an item is watchlisted. CORRECTION to the auditor's plan: crate::net exposes only https_get (net.rs:140) and https_post (net.rs:144) — there is

- **No "Shuffle Season" / shuffle play** — `minor` / `medium`
  The in-player More menu offers Shuffle Season. Our PlayQueue creation hard-codes `shuffle=0` and there is no UI entry point for a shuffled queue anywhere (season tabs, detail hero, player).
  *Where:* plex/timeline.rs (parameterise create_play_queue's shuffle, or add a season-uri variant), route.rs (a shuffled play entry beside request_play/request_play_up_next), ui/item_menu.rs + a player More menu for the entry point.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/timeline.rs:57 `.int("shuffle", 0)` inside create_play_queue is the ONLY shuffle token in rust-modules/src (the one other grep hit, card_row.rs:125, is prose about tile slot pinning). detail.rs:1198-1206 season-tab OK only calls metadata::load_season; player_hud.rs:201-208 ControlSlot is Discs|Skip|UpNext and player_hud.rs:468-471 the bottom tabs are only ["Info"]/["Info","Chapters"]. Note the queue is created per-ITEM (uri = server://…/library/metadata/{rating_key}, timeline.rs:52), so "Shuffle Season" needs a season-uri variant, not just flipping the flag — the auditor's medi

- **No Rate & Review** — `minor` / `medium`
  Rating an item (the official client's thumbs / 5-star + review) has no client, no model field, and no UI. Nothing reads or writes userRating.
  *Where:* plex/library.rs (new `rate(rating_key, value)` → GET /:/rate?key={rk}&identifier=com.plexapp.plugins.library&rating={0..10}), plex/models.rs (`userRating`), metadata.rs (Detail field), ui/item_menu.rs + ui/detail.rs for the control.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. grep for userRating/user_rating/audienceRating/:/rate over rust-modules/src returns literally nothing. plex/models.rs:124-125 carries only `contentRating` (the MPAA string) — no rating float of any kind, user or audience; plex/library.rs has no rate op; docs/pms-api.md documents no rate verb. Effort should be SMALL not medium for the thumbs/stars write path: client.rs:110 `get_void()` already exists and GET /:/rate?key=…&identifier=com.plexapp.plugins.library&rating=N is a one-line library.rs fn, mirroring scrobble at library.rs:90. Medium is only right if you build the star/thumbs

- **No Delete (admin media deletion) and no confirmation-dialog primitive to gate it with** — `minor` / `medium`
  The reference More menu's last row is Delete. We have no delete call, no admin/ownership check, and — importantly — no confirm-dialog component anywhere in ui/, so a destructive action has nothing to be guarded by.
  *Where:* stream.rs + plex/client.rs (a DELETE verb), plex/library.rs (`delete_item(rating_key)` → DELETE /library/metadata/{rk}), a new confirm-dialog View in ui/widgets.rs or ui/popover.rs, ui/item_menu.rs for the row (gated on the server being owned).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED on both halves. plex/client.rs's transport choke points are get_json(:97)/get_bytes(:104)/get_void(:110)/put(:117)/post_void(:122)/post_json(:127) — no DELETE; stream.rs exposes only http_get(:507)/http_put(:533)/http_post(:556). Grep for confirm/are you sure/dialog finds only unrelated prose. account.rs:144's `owned` on Resource is the only ownership signal and nothing surfaces it to the UI. TWO EFFORT CORRECTIONS, both downward: (1) stream.rs::http_open ALREADY takes an arbitrary `method: &str` (stream.rs:204-205), so http_delete is a ~15-line clone of http_put (:533) plus a client

- **No Share (send an item to a friend)** — `minor` / `large`
  "Share Episode" is row 5 of the reference context menu. There is no sharing surface: no friends list, no share endpoint, no share sheet.
  *Where:* plex/account.rs (GET https://plex.tv/api/v2/friends for the recipient list + the share POST), a new ui/share_sheet.rs (Popover + TableView + avatars, reusing ui/profiles.rs's circular RowStyle::PROFILES), ui/item_menu.rs for the entry row.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/account.rs implements only pins/resources/home_users/switch_user; there is no /api/v2/friends, no sharing call, and no share surface in ui/ (I enumerated every ui/*.rs against the module table in ui/CLAUDE.md — account_menu, anim, card_row, chapters_panel, consts, detail, fmt, home, icons, info_panel, label, library, login, mod, player_hud, popover, press, profile, profiles, skip_pill, table, text_view, theme, track_menu, up_next, widgets — no share/friends module). Effort large is right and understated for the same reason as the watchlist: net.rs (net.rs:140/:144) does GET and

- **No "Watch Together"** — `minor` / `large`
  Row 5 of the reference in-player More menu. Requires Plex's Watch Together / SyncPlay service; nothing in the app touches it.
  *Where:* plex/ (a new syncplay.rs: POST /playQueues + the plex.tv SyncPlay rooms API, plus a websocket/notification listener the app currently has no transport for), player/ for clock slaving, ui/item_menu.rs for the row.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. grep for syncplay/watch together over rust-modules/src returns nothing; plex/timeline.rs only creates a per-item local PlayQueue (:52-68) and posts /:/timeline. One nuance on the transport claim: the app does ship a WebSocket implementation, but it is in the HOST-side tools (tools/stream-screen.py's /ws + tools/jsmpeg.min.js consuming the capture stream) — the Rust side has no WebSocket client at all, so the auditor's point stands unchanged. Also correct that plex/client.rs:62-72's playback_identity headers are the only identity registration; there is no /player command endpoint or

- ~~**No Play Trailer / Extras**~~ — **button/menu CLOSED 2026-09-12, shelf CLOSED 2026-09-14.**
  Movie and show detail pages autoplay a playable trailer in the hero after a dwell. The item
  menu still offers Play Trailer. The hero Trailer disc is gone. Playback of a menu or shelf
  extra reuses `request_play` with the extra's rk/part, `resume_ns = 0`, HUD context `"Trailer"`
  (or `"Extra"` for a non-trailer clip), and `continuous` omitted. The background preview uses
  the same direct-play-only path and writes no watch state. `continuous` is omitted so EOS
  cannot Up-Next into a sibling extra. `metadata::current()` stays the parent.
  The extras shelf is `screens/detail/extras.rs`. `Detail.extras` holds every row;
  `Detail::trailer()` is the picker winner. Item menu Play Trailer is still cache-only from the
  loaded parent.

- **The in-player action set is scattered across three controls with no single "More" list, and no Settings entry** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official player's More menu is one list: Subtitle Track, Audio Track, Settings, Go to Show, Watch Together, Shuffle Season, Delete. Ours splits the two track pickers onto right-edge discs and buries Go to Show inside the Info card's button column; there is no consolidated list, and no Settings row at all (no playback-quality, subtitle-appearance, or player-preferences screen exists anywhere in the app).
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs (a third bottom tab or a new ControlSlot for "More"), a new ui/more_menu.rs on Popover+TableView, app.rs (a new Overlay variant beside Menu/Info/Chapters and its modal key arm); a Settings row needs a new section in `screens/settings.rs` plus persisted prefs (auth.json's store in plex/session.rs is the existing precedent).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player_hud.rs:200-208 ControlSlot = Discs | Skip(Prompt) | UpNext(Marker); player_hud.rs:468-471 tabs are exactly ["Info"] or ["Info","Chapters"]; info_panel.rs:48-50 actions() returns exactly ["From Beginning", "Go to Show"/"Go to Movie"]; app.rs:579-584 Overlay = None|Menu|Info|Chapters and its Modal twin at app.rs:600-607 matches. The Settings half is the stronger finding and the auditor understates it: grep for settings/preference over rust-modules/src finds ONLY table.rs:1/:8 ('Apple-TV settings look' — the widget's visual reference, and its doc explicitly anticipates 'a settin

- **No "Report Issue"** — `polish` / `small`
  The last row of the reference context menu. No reporting surface, no analytics/report client.
  *Where:* ui/item_menu.rs (the row) + a small ui/report_panel.rs; the backing call is a plex.tv support endpoint in plex/account.rs (or, more honestly for this app, a local log-and-toast).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED — grep for report over rust-modules/src matches only the timeline progress REPORTER (route.rs, plex/timeline.rs, player/threads.rs's ReportStop) and unrelated prose; no user-facing reporting surface, no form, no feedback panel in any ui/ module. Severity polish / effort small is right if it lands as the auditor's honest version (a row that logs to /tmp/nativejelly-events.log and shows a toast) — note there is no toast primitive either; widgets.rs::StatusOverlay is the nearest thing and it is the player's Working/Failed treatment, not a transient toast.

#### Playback, player HUD and in-player features

*Already implemented here: 26 reference features.*

- **OK on the Subtitles/Audio discs is dead code — the track menus are unreachable by remote** — `blocker` / `small`
  The official client opens Select Subtitle Track / Select Audio Track from the transport. In our OK handler the branch that opens the track menu is shadowed by an identical, EMPTY branch immediately above it, so pressing OK on a focused Subtitles or Audio disc does nothing at all. Only a pointer click (icon_hit) still reaches track_menu::open_tab — and the Magic Remote cursor is deliberately hidden the moment the user touches the D-pad. This is a working-tree regression: `git diff rust-modules/src/app.rs` shows the duplicate `} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {` line was introduced alongside the ControlSlot dispatch.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/app.rs:1408 (delete the empty branch). No PMS endpoint needed.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim. rust-modules/src/app.rs:1405 `if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 && !ctrl.is_discs()`, :1409 `} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {` with an EMPTY body, :1410 the identical condition guarding `track_menu::open_tab` at :1411 — line 1410's arm can never be entered, so OK on a focused disc is a no-op. `git diff rust-modules/src/app.rs` shows both 1409 and 1410 as `+` lines added with the ControlSlot dispatch, so this is a working-tree regression, not a design gap: the feature itself is fully built (ui/track_menu.rs, opened correctly by the pointer path at app.rs:1685-1687, and LEFT/

- **No thumbnail (BIF) preview while scrubbing** — `major` / `large`
  The official client shows a still from the video at the scrub position, following the playhead as you seek. We draw only a moving clock label under the knob. Nothing in the codebase fetches or renders a BIF index or a preview frame.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs (a preview tile above the knob, fed from the scrub fraction), a new fetch in rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs, and the decode/cache in rust-modules/src/posters.rs. PMS: GET /library/parts/{partId}/indexes/sd/{offsetMs} (and the BIF index itself at /library/parts/{partId}/indexes/sd).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED — nothing exists, not even in the data layer. `grep -rniE 'bif|indexes|preview'` over rust-modules/src returns only unrelated hits (remote.rs comments about string indexing, ff.rs:1449, and player_hud.rs:401's *scrub position* preview, which is a number not an image). ui/player_hud.rs:394-432 draws track/fill/knob/two clock labels only. plex/library.rs has no `/indexes` endpoint, plex/client.rs only has `image_transcode_path` (/photo/:/transcode) for posters. posters.rs/img.rs have no per-offset frame path. major/large is correct; note the lift is bigger than it looks because there i

- **Chapter markers are not drawn on the scrubber** — `major` / `small`
  The official client ticks the scrubber with the item's chapter boundaries so you can see and land on them while scrubbing. Our scrubber has no marks of any kind — not chapters, not intro/credits segments (which we already have as typed data).
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:399 (draw ticks from metadata chapters/markers before the knob). No new PMS call — ?includeChapters=1/?includeMarkers=1 are already requested in plex/library.rs:56-62.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/player_hud.rs:398-418 is one `p.rect` track + one `p.rrect` fill + the knob; nothing iterates chapters or markers, and player_hud.rs imports neither `metadata::Chapter` nor `metadata::Marker`. Important partial the auditor understates: the two data sources differ in reachability. **Markers ARE already on the playing leaf** (`metadata::playing_markers()`, metadata.rs:440, fed by PlayingItem.markers) so intro/credits ticks could be drawn today with no other change. **Chapters are NOT** — they live on `Detail.chapters` (metadata.rs:231) reached only through `metadata::current()`, wh

- **The scrubber shows no buffered range** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client paints the downloaded/buffered portion of the timeline as a lighter fill behind the played fill, so the user can tell buffering from a stall. Ours shows only played-vs-unplayed. A `RAIL_BUFFERED` token was even added to the theme for this and is used nowhere in the player.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/player/shared.rs (publish an AtomicI64 buffered_ns), rust-modules/src/player/engine.rs:813 (store it where max_fed_video_pts is updated), rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:399 (draw the band with theme::RAIL_BUFFERED).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, including the unpublished-signal detail. `grep -rn RAIL_BUFFERED` → only ui/theme.rs:159 (definition) and ui/detail.rs:967 (the episode row progress bar); the player never uses it. player/shared.rs's atomic list (lines 105-173, 244-253) has no buffered/queue-depth field — the closest is `pres_fed` (the PRESENTED frame's fed PTS, i.e. behind the playhead, not ahead of it), so it cannot substitute. The high-water mark is `Engine.max_fed_video_pts` (player/engine.rs:79, updated at engine.rs:813-814) which lives on the main-thread-only Engine and is not reachable from `player_hud::draw_

- **No transport buttons: play/pause, skip-back-10, skip-forward-30, previous/next episode** — `major` / `medium`
  The official transport row is a set of on-screen buttons. Our control row holds exactly two discs (Subtitles, Audio); play/pause is only a state read-out beside the clock, explicitly documented as 'not an action toggle', and there is no skip-back/skip-forward control and no previous/next-episode control at any point during playback. Seeking is remote-key-only (LEFT/RIGHT ± the Skip interval, 10 s by default), so the pointer user has no discrete skip at all, and the asymmetric back-10/forward-30 the reference uses does not exist.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs (widen the control row / add a centred transport cluster), rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs:403 (TransportButton variants), rust-modules/src/ui/icons.rs + assets/icons/ (skip-back/skip-forward/prev/next SVGs), rust-modules/src/app.rs:1529 (LEFT/RIGHT clamp) and 1674 (pointer dispatch). Previous/next episode need no new endpoint — the continuous=1 PlayQueue already carries the successor (route.rs:403).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED as an ON-SCREEN gap, but the auditor overstates it for remote users — correct the framing and drop severity to minor/medium. What exists: dedicated Magic-Remote transport keys are wired (ui/consts.rs:49-51 WCODE_PAUSE=72 / WCODE_STOP=413 / WCODE_PLAY=450, handled at app.rs:1489-1512), OK toggles play/pause (app.rs:1424-1429), LEFT/RIGHT seek ± the Skip interval (10 s by default; app.rs:546 `SCRUB_STEP_NS = 10_000_000_000` as audited, since replaced by `ui::player_hud::scrub_step_ns()`, which reads the Settings > Playback preference; applied at :1559) with hold-to-scrub, the pointer can grab and drag the scrub band (player_hud::scrub_hit/scrub_frac_x → app.rs:1688-1696), and a next-episode action DOES exist as the Up Next til

- **The Chapters tab never appears for the main episode-play path** — `major` / `small`
  Chapters are read from the DETAIL page's item, not the playing leaf. Playing an episode from a show page leaves `metadata::current()` on the SHOW — which carries no Chapter[] — so `has_chapters()` is false and the HUD draws only the Info tab. Chapters therefore work for a movie and for an episode launched from Home (which fetches the episode's own detail), but silently vanish on the normal show-page → episode route. The same aliasing means that if `current()` ever holds a different leaf, the strip would seek using another item's chapter offsets.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs (add `chapters: Vec<Chapter>` to PlayingItem and populate it in fetch_playing_item, mirroring `markers`), rust-modules/src/ui/chapters_panel.rs (read `metadata::playing()` with `current()` as fallback). No new PMS call — ?includeChapters=1 is already on the leaf fetch (plex/library.rs:61).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED with the aliasing analysis intact, but the blast radius is narrower than stated — correct the scope. Every chapters_panel accessor goes through `metadata::current()` (chapters_panel.rs:34 `n()`, :44 `open()`, :90 `on_ok()`, :115 `draw()`), and PlayingItem (metadata.rs:424-430) carries rk/audio/subs/video_fps/markers but deliberately NOT chapters. Where it WORKS (contra 'only movies and Home-launched'): movies; any leaf played from Home (app.rs:872 `metadata::request_detail(&mm.rk)` in `play_item_now`); AND the auto-advance chain (app.rs:842 `request_detail(&rk)` inside `play_up_next`

- **Up Next only appears when the server produced a credits marker; otherwise playback cuts to the next episode with no card and no countdown** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client shows the Up Next card with a countdown at the end of every episode. Ours is gated on a Credits marker being under the playhead, and a large share of the library has no credits marker (the codebase's own notes list items that carry credits only, or nothing). Without one, end-of-stream jumps straight into the next episode with no interstitial, no title, and no chance to stop it — the comment at app.rs:759 states this as intent: 'There is no interstitial: always the next episode.'
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:239 (offer UpNext on an end-of-item proximity condition — e.g. last N seconds of duration — as well as on a credits marker) and rust-modules/src/app.rs:2088 (route EOS through an armed countdown instead of an immediate advance). No new PMS call.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/player_hud.rs:245-258 `slot_for`: `ControlSlot::UpNext` requires `Some(m)` AND `m.kind == Credits` AND `has_next`; with no marker the arm is `None => ControlSlot::Discs`. ui/up_next.rs:46-56 `tick` arms the deadline only while `is_shown(slot)`, and resets the moment the slot is not UpNext. app.rs:2089-2092: `player::ended()` → `finish_playback` → `play_up_next` (app.rs:823-847) which stops the engine and starts the successor immediately — no card, no countdown, no cancel. The countdown machinery itself is complete and good (up_next.rs:28 `COUNTDOWN_MS = 10_000`, the Button::progr

- **~~No playback quality / bitrate selection~~ and no in-player Settings** — `major` / `medium`
  **PARTLY LANDED 2026-08-24** — `route::Quality` is an Original-plus-five-fixed-rungs ladder in the player's `…` popover, with gated Auto support; `TranscodeSpec` carries `Ceiling`, and `route::transcode_spec` passes it. The selection now persists. Read the rest of this row as the gap it WAS. See §2 G.
  The official in-player menu has a Settings entry driving playback quality (Original / capped bitrates), which changes the transcode decision. Ours hardcoded a single quality and had no user-facing control (see the note above — the ladder landed); still true is that the bottom tab row offers only Info and Chapters. The same missing surface is where 'auto-play next episode on/off' would live.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/params.rs + rust-modules/src/plex/transcoder.rs:79 (a quality field on TranscodeSpec), rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:455 (a third tab) plus a new settings panel next to ui/track_menu.rs, and a persisted preference alongside rust-modules/src/plex/session.rs.
  *Verified:* UPDATED 2026-08-24. Quality persistence is now explicit in `plex/session.rs`; `route::set_quality` writes through the session's locked read-modify-write seam and the boot/credential handoff restores it. Literal legacy files with no field remain Original. The separate full Settings surface and its other preferences remain absent; quality intentionally stays in the existing in-player overflow popover.

- **No subtitle appearance controls (size / position / style)** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client lets the user set subtitle size, position and style. Size and vertical
  position have landed as Settings > Playback pickers (`route::subtitle_size`/
  `route::subtitle_position`, `ui/player_hud.rs`'s `draw_subtitle_message`); tone (a grey ladder,
  not a colour wheel) landed earlier via `ui::track_menu`'s Style pages. Outline/background style is
  still a compile-time constant. None of the plain-text controls apply to native ASS/SSA: those
  tracks retain their authored styles and positions through libass. The timing offset half also
  landed — see "No subtitle timing (sync) offset" below (`ui::track_menu`'s Timing section,
  `player::subtitle_offset_range_ms`).
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs (outline/background style still literal), plus the
  settings surface noted in the quality gap for anything beyond size/position/tone/offset.
  No PMS endpoint needed.
  *Verified:* UPDATED 2026-09-30. Size and position read the viewer's Settings > Playback pick;
  outline width and background are still `ui/player_hud.rs`'s literals. Historical evidence before
  native ASS support: the ASS-override strip at player/mod.rs:314 is `'{' => whi

- **~~No playback stats / Direct Play vs Transcode read-out in the player~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31**
  `app::diagnostics` now renders the shared playback Diagnostics overlay for Direct, Original/remux and HLS, and is reachable from the in-player overflow. A dev trigger can still render its device-only state off-player for automated captures, but it is not a global Account setting. It reports the actual delivery/output state, codecs, raster/fps when known, buffer/controller evidence and requested-versus-observed HLS response without exposing server identities.
  *Historical proposal:* rust-modules/src/ui/info_panel.rs (a stats block or a third HUD tab), reading route::is_transcoding/stream_vcodec/stream_acodec and player/shared.rs state.
  *Historical audit evidence:* the Info card itself still contains catalog metadata rather than live transport data; the implemented surface is the separate `app::diagnostics` overlay.

- **Pause and resume are not reported to the server until the next 10s tick** — `minor` / `small`
  The official client posts /:/timeline on every state transition, so 'Now Playing' and any controlling client see pause/resume immediately. Our only in-playback reporter is the 10s loop, which merely samples `TX.paused` when it happens to wake — so the server can show 'playing' for up to 10 seconds after the user pauses, and the resume point on an app kill is up to 10 seconds stale.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/app.rs:1421 / 1483 / 1697 (fire an immediate report) or better, a `report_now` nudge on rust-modules/src/player/threads.rs's ReportStop condvar so the existing worker posts off the main thread. Endpoint already wired: POST /:/timeline (plex/timeline.rs:15).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player/threads.rs:21 `const REPORT_INTERVAL_S: u64 = 10`; the reporter loop (threads.rs:73-92) is `loop { if stop.wait_or_stop(REPORT_INTERVAL_S) { return } … }` and only samples `TX.paused` at :84-88 when it happens to wake. `report_timeline` has exactly two call sites (grep: route.rs:956 definition, threads.rs:90 the loop) plus the final stopped report inside route.rs:149-206's teardown ritual. `player::pause`/`resume` (player/mod.rs:62-69) do the Starfish Pause/Play plus the ACB playstate mirror and nothing network-facing; the three UI call sites (app.rs:1424-1429, 1484-1487, 169

- **No Plex Companion receiver — the app advertises X-Plex-Provides=player but cannot be controlled or cast to** — `minor` / `large`
  The official client can be picked as a playback target from the Plex phone/web app ('Play on TV'), and accepts remote transport commands. We advertise ourselves as a player on every playback request and create a PlayQueue explicitly 'so the session is a first-class, remote-controllable player', but there is no companion HTTP listener, no GDM announce and no /player/playback command handling, so nothing can actually drive us.
  *Where:* A new module beside rust-modules/src/net.rs (a small HTTP listener for /player/timeline/subscribe, /player/playback/{play,pause,seekTo,skipNext,skipPrevious,setStreams}), dispatching into the existing app.rs transport handlers, plus GDM discovery on UDP 32412/32414.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/client.rs:44 `const PROVIDES: &str = "player"` sent on every playback request via `playback_identity` (client.rs:71); plex/timeline.rs:46-57 creates the `continuous=1` PlayQueue explicitly for remote-controllability. `grep -rniE 'companion|\bgdm\b|/player/'` over the tree returns nothing. The only `TcpListener` instances in rust-modules/src are in host unit tests (stream.rs:680/712/759/777, ff.rs:1823); the dev capture stream (capture.rs) is the sole real listener and is trigger-gated. net.rs is libcurl client-side only. minor/large is right — and note the lift includes a UDP G

- **No explicit Resume vs Play from Start choice when starting an item** — `minor` / `small`
  The official client offers both — a Resume action and a separate Play from Beginning — on the item page. Ours always applies the resume rule silently: the detail Play pill is labelled 'Play' whatever the state, and the only way to restart is to begin playback at the resume point and then open the in-player Info card's 'From Beginning'.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:827-840 (a second pill, or a Resume label plus a long-press/secondary action) feeding the existing `last_resume_ns` at detail.rs:1131. No new PMS call.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with a partial the auditor missed that makes the lift smaller. ui/detail.rs:833 `Button::new(c"Play".as_ptr(), …)` is a fixed label and ui/detail.rs:88 `const NBTN: c_int = 2` (Play + watched toggle) leaves no room for a second action; detail.rs:1135-1137 `set_resume` applies `metadata::resume_ns` unconditionally and `on_ok` (detail.rs:1148+) has no from-start branch. BUT the Continue-vs-Play label logic already exists on Home: ui/home.rs:425 `let plabel = if hero.resume_ms > 0 { c"Continue" } else { c"Play" }` — so the detail page is simply not doing what the home hero already does

- **In-player menu lacks Shuffle Season, Watch Together, Delete and an explicit Play Next Episode** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official in-player menu carries these alongside the track pickers. We have none: the PlayQueue is created with shuffle and repeat hard-wired to 0, there is no delete call anywhere in the data layer, no Watch Together, and no way to jump to the next episode except waiting for a credits marker to surface the Up Next tile.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/timeline.rs:51 (shuffle/repeat parameters on create_play_queue), a new DELETE /library/metadata/{rk} in rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs, and a new actions panel beside rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs reachable from a third HUD tab in ui/player_hud.rs:455.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED for shuffle, Watch Together and delete; PARTIALLY WRONG on 'Play Next Episode'. plex/timeline.rs:56-58 `.int("continuous", 1).int("shuffle", 0).int("repeat", 0)` — both hardwired, no parameter on `create_play_queue`. `grep -rniE 'watch together|delete'` over rust-modules/src/plex returns nothing; there is no DELETE verb in the data layer at all. ui/track_menu.rs:18 confirms the two tabs (0=Audio, 1=Subtitles) and player_hud.rs:454-459 the two HUD tabs. CORRECTION: an explicit next-episode action DOES exist — the Up Next tile (ui/up_next.rs, `ControlSlot::UpNext`, activated by OK via

- **Subtitles and Audio become unreachable for the whole length of an intro/credits segment** — `polish` / `small`
  Our Skip pill REPLACES the two transport discs rather than sitting alongside them, so while the playhead is inside a marker the user cannot open the subtitle or audio picker at all — and intro segments routinely run 60-90 seconds. The official client shows Skip Intro as an additional affordance without removing the transport controls.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:141-232 (make the control row hold three items — skip stand-in plus both discs — instead of a mutually-exclusive slot), with the LEFT/RIGHT clamp at app.rs:1531 following ControlSlot::items().
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and the codebase states it as a deliberate trade-off rather than an oversight — ui/skip_pill.rs:6-10: 'Replacing them rather than joining them is the design call… The cost is that CC/Audio are unreachable for the length of the segment.' Mechanically: ui/player_hud.rs:383-390 the `Skip`/`UpNext` arms draw INSTEAD of the two TransportButtons; player_hud.rs:212-217 `items()` returns 1 for both stand-ins so the LEFT/RIGHT clamp at app.rs:1531 pins `btn` to 0; player_hud.rs:283-291 `icon_hit` returns None whenever `!slot.is_discs()`, killing the pointer path too. Note the window is wider

- **A failed playback had no retry affordance** — `polish` / `small`
  PlaybackState::Error now draws a cause-aware full-screen read-out. OK opens the shared quality ladder; selecting the current rung retries the same item at its retained position/tracks, while another rung retries under that policy. BACK still exits. There is deliberately no automatic generic fallback from every failed manual/fixed direct play.
  *Where:* `ui/player_hud.rs::draw_failed_readout`, `app.rs::key_player_failed` / `retry_failed_playback`, and `route.rs::retry_current_play`.
  *Verified:* RESOLVED 2026-08-31. `player::error_shape` distinguishes a refused PMS decision, an audio-only stream, an unreadable media source, an interrupted transfer, and a native-pipeline Load refusal; `player_hud::draw_failed_readout` fills the reason slot and advertises OK quality/retry plus BACK. `app::retry_failed_playback` performs a real stop and fresh resolve from the retained request/position/track selection. Automatic recovery remains scoped: cold Auto Original falls back to its retained HLS bootstrap and a runtime HLS→Original experiment rolls back; manual/fixed failures wait for the viewer's retry choice.

#### Sign-in, profiles, settings, watchlist & Discover

*Already implemented here: 19 reference features.*


- ~~**A remote-only or relay-only server cannot be used at all** — `blocker` / `large`~~
  **Implemented 2026-08-23; device acceptance remains.** Discovery retains and ranks the full
  connection URLs from `/api/v2/resources?includeHttps=1&includeRelay=1`, TLS-first. `http.rs`
  routes HTTPS PMS control through `net.rs`/libcurl, `curlio.rs` carries HTTPS media, and the raw
  `stream.rs` arm resolves hostnames plus IPv4/IPv6 for plaintext. Host tests cover routing,
  ranking, status-vs-reachability and media byte ranges. The remaining gate is a real-TV
  remote/relay browse-and-play session, not missing transport code.
- ~~**No Settings screen exists at all**~~ **A Settings shell exists; the preference coverage remains narrow** — `major` / `large`
  **Partially implemented 2026-09-01; the shell was rebuilt, not the finding, in phase 5b
  (2026-09-07) — every `ui/settings.rs` path below is now `screens/settings.rs`, and the surface
  itself is no longer the `Popover` this paragraph describes.** As of 2026-09-01, `ui/settings.rs`
  was a shared `Popover` + `TableView` surface reached from every account-menu state. Phase 5b
  moved that behaviour, unchanged in substance, onto an OWNED `Screen` (`screens::settings`'s
  `RouteSurface`, a stack of pages — root, Privacy, Legal, Favourites, Document — mounted on the
  dispatcher's `ModalStack` and walking its own BACK before the container hears anything) rather
  than a `Popover` instance; the "no `Route::Settings` arm" fact this paragraph originally noted
  still holds today, for the same reason it held before — the surface is a modal presentation, not
  a value the legacy `Route` enum takes. It still hosts Home/server selection (*Favourite
  libraries*), Privacy & data (including reversible crash/usage choices), Legal notices and About.
  The official client's playback preferences (video quality per network, auto-skip intro/credits,
  subtitle appearance, audio options and Continue Watching behaviour) and a general persisted
  preference store are still absent — that is the actual finding, and phase 5b did not touch it.
  The credentials session remains separate from preferences so a bad preference parse can never
  cost the account token.
  *Where next:* add a versioned preference file alongside `plex/session.rs`, then add the missing
  sections to `screens/settings.rs`. No PMS endpoint is needed for the shell itself.
  *Verified:* `screens/settings.rs` defines the four current destinations (its `SettingsPage` in
  `screens/family.rs`); `ui/account_menu.rs` exposes `Action::Settings` in signed-in, signed-out
  and switching states; `app/bridge.rs` mounts the surface and gives it input ownership ahead of
  the legacy ladders (`Dispatcher::owns_input`) — the current equivalent of the "modal first
  refusal in key, pointer, update and draw dispatch" this line originally attributed to `app.rs`,
  a file phase 1a's decomposition retired well before this restructure reached Settings; the
  mechanism this bullet is actually verifying (Settings gets first look at input) is unchanged,
  only the file and the dispatch shape are. There is still no general-purpose prefs module.

- **No Watchlist — not readable, not addable, not removable** — `major` / `large`
  The official client has Watchlist as a first-class sidebar destination spanning owned-library and Discover-only titles, plus an add/remove action on every detail page. We have none of it: no watchlist fetch, no watchlist shelf or grid, and no watchlist control on the detail page.
  *Where:* Extend `plex/discover.rs` for
  `GET https://discover.provider.plex.tv/library/sections/watchlist/all` and `PUT|DELETE`
  `https://discover.provider.plex.tv/actions/addToWatchlist|removeFromWatchlist?ratingKey=…`;
  `net::request` already supports body-less custom verbs. Add a third control in `ui/detail.rs`
  `draw_buttons`/`on_ok`, plus a Watchlist tab and a grid reusing `ui/library.rs`.
  *Verified:* Still open. The Home/Movies/TV Shows/Search row (whose type pills follow the favourite set since 2026-09-05) has no Watchlist destination,
  and the detail action row has no Watchlist mutation.

- **No user-facing server picker when the account has several servers** — `major` / `medium`
  The official client shows a server list when the account has more than one and lets you switch at any time. We select an owned-first primary and expose same-type alternatives through the Library Source panel, but there is no global manual primary-server chooser. A transport failure may automatically re-probe and re-point that same machine after a Wi-Fi/LAN transition; that recovery is not a user choice and cannot select a different grant as the primary.
  *Where:* New picker screen (`ui/servers.rs`, reusing the profiles screen's row shape) plus a `Route::Servers` arm; auth already retains and registers the granted roster, and the registry can re-point a stable machine slot.
  *Verified:* Still open. Runtime origin changes exist only as automatic same-machine recovery; no route or account/settings action lets the user choose a different server as global primary.

- **A revoked stored PMS token is not distinguished from a transport failure** — `major` / `medium`
  Address recovery is now automatic: a failed Home/Library source queues a targeted `/resources`
  probe, re-points the same granted machine when another endpoint answers, and persists that route
  without replacing the active profile's PMS token. Home also has loading/failure/retry states.
  The remaining gap is authorization: generic PMS reads still collapse a 401 into failure, so a
  revoked token does not route to a specific re-authentication explanation.

- ~~**A signed-in account without Plex Home managed users is labelled "Sign in"**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-23.** Both account surfaces now word themselves from `Session::account` through ONE resolver, `ui::account_menu::chip_label` — the popover in an earlier commit, the profile chip on this date. `auth.rs` still never writes `session.user` on the single-user path, which is exactly why the fix is at the READING end, and why a third account surface must call that resolver rather than `current().title`. The two call sites this entry names below have both moved. Kept as a record; the description that follows is what the defect WAS.
  For any account whose /home/users roster has one entry (i.e. no Plex Home), the app never populates the signed-in user, so the Home profile chip renders the generic person glyph with the label "Sign in" and the account popover's header reads "Account" — while the user is in fact signed in and streaming.
  *Where:* auth.rs:335-348 (seed `session.user` from the roster's `admin` entry — HomeUser already carries id/uuid/title/thumb, plex/account.rs:191-211 — or add a `GET /api/v2/user` to plex/account.rs and use it); no UI change needed once UserRef is populated.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED as a fact, but the severity is overstated. auth.rs:341-348: the users.len() > 1 else-branch goes straight to Phase::Ready without ever writing c.session.user, so it stays UserRef::default() (empty title/thumb/uuid); take_ready then set_current(Some(<empty UserRef>)) at auth.rs:198, and the boot gate repeats it at app.rs:413/419. Consequences, checked precisely: ui/widgets.rs:131 renders the chip label 'Sign in', widgets.rs:177-181 falls back to Icon::User for the avatar, and ui/account_menu.rs:44 titles the popover 'Account'. BUT the popover's ACTIONS are correct — account_menu.rs:38

- **No preferred audio / subtitle language setting** — `major` / `medium`
  *Resolved by #203:* audio is now read through `route/plan.rs`'s `AudioLangPrefs`, supplied by `plex/account.rs`'s `AccountClient::audio_preferences` from plex.tv `/api/v2/user`; see **AUDIO CLOSED by #203** below. Subtitle claims remain open.
  The official client lets you set preferred audio and subtitle languages (and "always show subtitles"). Our audio auto-pick hardcodes English and there is no subtitle-language preference at all, so a non-English household gets an English track forced on every single play with no way to change the default.
  *Where:* route.rs:654-657 and `pick_dp_audio` (route.rs:663-700) to read the preference instead of a const; an equivalent subtitle auto-pick beside it; the preference values from the new settings store (see the Settings-screen gap) with rows in `screens/settings.rs`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. route.rs:657 `const PREF_AUDIO_LANG: &str = "eng";` is the whole policy, ranked first at route.rs:685 inside pick_dp_audio (663-698). There is no subtitle auto-pick at all: subtitles start OFF (route.rs:70-73 set_subtitle(0), transcoder.rs:86-88 only burns when subtitle_stream_id > 0) and the only way to enable one is the in-player menu → route::commit_subtitle_selection (route.rs:940-950). One correction to 'nothing persists the choice': a user pick IS persisted SERVER-side — commit_subtitle_selection/commit_audio_selection call put_selection → PUT /library/parts/{id}?allParts=1&su

- **No auto-skip intro / credits preference** — `minor` / `small`
  The official client offers "Auto skip intro" and "Auto skip credits", which skip the marker without any user press. We only ever offer a manual Skip button; the markers are already fetched and typed, so the data is there and unused.
  *Where:* app.rs:2198-2235 (where the control-row edge is already detected — fire the seek instead of claiming focus when the preference is on) plus ui/skip_pill.rs for the brief "Skipped intro" affordance; the toggle lives in the new settings store/screen.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/skip_pill.rs is draw + prompt_for + rect only — no timer, no auto-fire. The sole activation is app.rs's activate_ctrl_row (app.rs:786-810: SkipAction::Seek → mark_skipped + request_seek, SkipAction::Finish → finish_playback), reached from the OK key and the pointer. The per-frame block at app.rs:2201-2235 only extends the HUD and moves hud_nav.focus onto the row on a fresh offer. No 'auto skip' string anywhere. The data really is all there and typed: metadata::playing_markers (metadata.rs:441), Marker/MarkerKind/final_seg (metadata.rs:103-136), mark_skipped (metadata.rs:155) and

- **No subtitle appearance settings (size, colour, background)** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official client exposes subtitle size, position, colour and background/outline. Background/outline are still compile-time constants; size, position and tone now have viewer controls.
  *Partly landed 2026-09-17, size/position landed 2026-09-30:* the caption's TONE is a viewer preference — a **Color** section under the tracks in the player's Subtitles menu (`ui::track_menu`), white plus a five-rung gray ladder (`plex::session::SubtitleTone`, inks in `theme::SUBTITLE_INKS`), persisted install-wide in the session preferences and applied to text cues as ink and to image cues as a tint. SIZE and POSITION are now Settings > Playback pickers (`plex::session::SubtitleSize`/`SubtitlePosition`, `route::subtitle_size`/`subtitle_position`, applied in `ui::player_hud::draw_subtitle_message`), persisted the same way. Background/outline are still the constants described here, and a server-BURNED subtitle is pixels none of these can reach.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs (parameterise background from a preference too) and the image-subtitle composite at ui/player_hud.rs for scaling. Server-side burn size already has a knob we hardcode at plex/transcoder.rs (`subtitleSize=100`).
  *Verified:* UPDATED 2026-09-30. `draw_subtitle_message` scales its face size and line pitch by `subtitle_size_scale(route::subtitle_size())` and shifts its baseline by `subtitle_position_lift(route::subtitle_position())`; the outline stays a fixed 4-offset 2px `theme::scrim_black(0.85)`. `draw_subtitle_bitmap`'s image-subtitle composite is unaffected by either preference, same as native ASS/SSA. The server-side burn size is still pinned at plex/transcoder.rs (`subtitleSize=100`). minor/medium is right for what remains (background/outline, image-subtitle position).

- **No video-quality setting for local vs remote playback** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official client lets you cap streaming quality separately for local and remote playback (e.g. "Original" on LAN, 8 Mbps remote). Our capability profile and transcode caps are compile-time constants — the user cannot lower quality to fight buffering or raise a cap.
  *Where:* plex/transcoder.rs:36-46 and 68-98 (take the caps from the preference store instead of consts; `TranscodeSpec` in plex/params.rs would carry them), driven by rows in `screens/settings.rs`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/transcoder.rs:36-46 profile_extra() is a fixed format! with no inputs (width 3840 / height 2176 / bitDepth 10 upper bounds + one hevc+ac3 transcode target); transcoder.rs:82 hardcodes videoResolution=3840x2160 and maxVideoBitrate=60000 for the re-encode flavour, and the remux flavour (transcoder.rs:80) deliberately sets no cap at all. TranscodeSpec (plex/params.rs) carries no quality fields. There is no local/remote distinction to hang the two settings off, since only local connections are ever used (see the remote-server gap). minor/medium is fair given remote playback does no

- **No "autoplay next episode" toggle or countdown length** — `minor` / `small`
  The official client lets you turn off auto-play of the next episode (and the post-play behaviour). **Update:** Settings > Playback > Next episode now offers Up Next countdown (the default), After credits and Off, so the toggle exists; the countdown length is still the fixed 10 s `COUNTDOWN_MS`, so only the length control remains absent. *As audited:* ours always auto-advanced after a fixed 10s countdown and the module documented that as a deliberate absolute.
  *Where:* ui/up_next.rs:28,46-54 (gate arming on the preference, take the duration from it) and app.rs:2094-2099; toggle row in `screens/settings.rs`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/up_next.rs:28 COUNTDOWN_MS = 10_000, armed unconditionally in tick (up_next.rs:47-56 — the only guard is the per-segment CANCELLED latch), consumed by the button's own fill sweep at up_next.rs:191; app.rs fires the advance on expiry and app.rs:762-772 finish_playback calls play_up_next first with the 'There is no interstitial: "always the next episode"' comment. Worth adding as partial: there IS a per-segment escape — moving focus off the tile calls up_next::cancel (app.rs:2229-2233 / up_next.rs:116-121) and latches for that segment — so the user can stop one advance in the momen

- **No account information (email, username, subscription) except the name on the no-server read-out** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official Settings screen shows the signed-in account — username/email, avatar, Plex Pass status — and a way to manage it. We fetch a narrow preference-only view of the plex.tv user object for audio selection, but do not retain or display its account-information fields, with one exception: a sign-in that ends in "no server yet" fetches the account's name once to say who signed in, and holds it in UI state only; the account popover's header is just the Plex Home profile title (or the literal string "Account").
  *Where:* expand plex/account.rs's narrow `/api/v2/user` DTO, persist the display fields through plex/session.rs, and add an account section in `screens/settings.rs` (or expand the account-menu header).
  *Verified:* The `/api/v2/user` call deliberately deserializes only identity plus audio preferences. Only the audio-preference DTO is modeled for the audio rung; no email or subscription field is modeled or shown anywhere. The one display field read is the name (`username`, else `title`, else `friendlyName`) by a second narrow DTO, fetched only after a no-server sign-in and shown only on that read-out, never stored. UserRef remains id/uuid/title/thumb/token; nullable display fields must be `Option<String>` because serde `default` does not cover an explicit null.

- **No audio settings (boost / passthrough / downmix)** — `minor` / `medium`
  The official client exposes audio boost for quiet dialogue and a passthrough/stereo-downmix choice. We have no audio preferences: the direct-play audio codec set and the Starfish Load payload are fixed.
  *Where:* player/engine.rs:22-31 (payload construction would have to become parameterised rather than three consts) and plex/transcoder.rs:22-25/68-98 for the server-side downmix (`audioBoost`/`maxAudioChannels` on the universal-transcoder query); rows in `screens/settings.rs`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with one evidence correction. plex/transcoder.rs:22-25 DP_AUDIO_CODECS/is_dp_audio are fixed; no audioBoost/maxAudioChannels/downmix param is ever sent (transcode_query, transcoder.rs:65-98, sets only audioStreamID + directStreamAudio); a whole-crate grep for audioBoost|passthrough|downmix hits only two unrelated doc comments (plex/client.rs's 'passthrough' in the encoder doc, ui/profile.rs:32 'a passthrough when disabled'). The correction: the Load payloads are NOT fully literal — player/engine.rs:174-194 build_av_payload string-substitutes the real video/audio codec, sink dimensio
  **Update (issue #266, landed):** boost/normalisation are no longer absent. The player's Audio tab
  (`ui/track_menu.rs`) now carries "Boost dialog"/"Normalize loudness" toggle rows, gated to a
  known-capable track on a Plex Pass server's Original-family route with no subtitle on screen and
  no Dolby Vision on the base layer (`route::plan::enhancements_offered`); the rows do not exist at
  all otherwise — no greyed row, no upsell text. The wire params are `boostDialog=1`/
  `normalizeLoudness=1` on the universal-transcoder query, per-track gated by
  `Stream.canNormalizeLoudness` (PMS 1.43.4+). Passthrough and downmix remain unclaimed.

- **Discover / "Movies & Shows on Plex" catalog is absent (adjacent-catalog feature)** — `minor` / `large`
  ADJACENT CATALOG, not a library feature: the official client has a Discover destination browsing plex.tv's catalog of movies/shows that are not on your server — Trending, and free ad-supported streaming titles playable in-app. We have no notion of a non-server item at all: every screen indexes catalog rows fetched from the PMS.
  *Where:* New `plex/discover.rs` on the net.rs HTTPS transport (plex.tv catalog endpoints), a Discover entry in the tab row (ui/widgets.rs:540-592), a grid screen reusing ui/library.rs/ui/card_row.rs, and a non-PMS item variant through pms::PmsMovie/ui/detail.rs. Playback of ad-supported titles would additionally need a non-PMS stream path in route.rs/stream.rs.
  *Verified:* Still open. The top row contains no Discover/community destination; the item
  and playback models remain PMS-shaped.

- **Friend activity, Find Friends and social Profile tabs are absent (adjacent-catalog feature)** — `minor` / `large`
  ADJACENT CATALOG, not a library feature: the official client's Discover area includes a friend activity feed, Find Friends, and a social profile (watch stats, ratings). None of this exists here.
  *Where:* New `plex/community.rs` (plex.tv community/social endpoints over net.rs) plus a new screen under ui/; would also need the Discover item model from the Discover-catalog gap.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. Grep for friend|community|activity across rust-modules/src matches only remote.rs's 'U+3000 and friends' comment and metadata.rs:20 friendly_codec. plex/account.rs has no social endpoint (method list ends at switch_user, account.rs:104); ui/ has no such screen. Note ui/profile.rs is NOT a social profile — it is the draw-time GPU profiler behind /tmp/nativejelly-profile (profile.rs:1-12), which is easy to mistake for one when scanning the file list. minor/large stands; it strictly depends on the Discover item model landing first.

- **Sign-out leaves the device authorized on plex.tv** — `polish` / `small`
  Signing out only deletes the local session file; the TV stays in the account's authorized-device list with a live token until the user removes it from plex.tv by hand.
  *Where:* plex/account.rs (add `DELETE https://plex.tv/api/v2/devices/{id}` keyed on the persisted client_id) and net.rs:84-146 (a custom-request verb); called from auth.rs:256-261 best-effort before the local clear.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED for the gap itself (still no plex.tv device-revocation call); the *local* clearing claim below is date-stamped pre-forward-port and is now stale. auth.rs:256-261 sign_out() = session::clear() + set_current(None) + Ctl::default() + start_login(). Before the AUTH-08/AUTH-09 forward-port package, plex/session.rs:152-156 clear() only unlinked the two legacy auth.json paths. As of that package, session.rs's clear() (~2325-2425) additionally sweeps the full recognized legacy migration-candidate set (not just the two auth.json paths), fsyncs each parent directory for durability, and commits an explicit Cleared record to the canonical DB8/host authority via persistence::commit_cleared(), returning a ClearOutcome::Durable/NotDurable verdict rather than clearing silently — see docs/v0.7.0-forward-port-verification.md's AUTH-08/AUTH-09 row. Sign-out therefore now clears materially more than the local legacy files this entry originally described; it still never calls `DELETE /api/v2/devices/{id}`, so the device stays in the account's authorized-device list on plex.tv, which remains the real gap this entry names. No device endpoint exists in plex/account.rs (the only /api/v2 URLs in the crate are pins, pins/qr, resources, home/users, home/users/{uuid}/switch), and net.rs has no DELETE verb (perform, net.rs:84, only toggles CURLOPT_POST). The client_id needed for the call is persisted and stable (session.rs:44-46), and account.rs:34 already notes these headers are what plex.tv's authorized-devices list shows — so the data is

- **Sign-in screen omits the official screen's copy and branding cues** — `polish` / `small`
  The reference screen puts the link code in large amber characters, spaces the characters out, uses an "OR" divider between the code and the QR, carries a Terms of Service / Privacy Policy footnote, and sits on a purple gradient. Ours is a flat dark two-column layout with the code in ordinary primary ink and no legal footnote.
  *Where:* ui/login.rs:84-133 (code colour → an accent/amber token from ui/theme.rs, a divider between the QR card and the column, a footnote TextView at the bottom margin, optional gradient via `p.rect` with two colours).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with a nuance on 'copy'. ui/login.rs:71 clears to theme::CLEAR_RGB (flat #2C2C2E, no gradient); the code is drawn at login.rs:122 with theme::TEXT_PRIMARY at size::HERO, no letter spacing and no amber/accent token; there is no divider element and no ToS/Privacy string in the file. Nuance: the instructional copy is NOT absent — login.rs:107 'Sign in to Plex', login.rs:112 'Scan the code with your phone camera, or go to plex.tv/link and enter this code:', login.rs:129 'Waiting for you to sign in…'. So the accurate claim is narrower: missing are the amber letter-spaced code, the OR div

- **PIN pad has no "forgot PIN" affordance** — `polish` / `small`
  The official picker's PIN screen tells a user who has forgotten the profile PIN where to reset it. Ours flashes red on a wrong PIN and offers only BACK.
  *Where:* ui/profiles.rs:240-300 (a caption under the keypad, e.g. pointing at plex.tv/pin reset), sized from the theme::size ladder.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/profiles.rs:240-299 draw_pad draws the scrim, the 'Enter {name}'s PIN' title, the four dots (or a Spinner while submitting, with the DANGER red pulse on error), and the 3x4 keypad — nothing else. pad_key (profiles.rs:466-470) resets the pad on BACK and otherwise only accepts digits/arrows, and the failure copy is auth.rs:451-453 ('Couldn't switch profile — check the PIN.') with no recovery hint. polish/small is right; the caption would sit under pad_key_rect's grid (profiles.rs:301-306 gives the geometry) and should take a theme::size rung, not a raw size.


### Part 2 — Player (vs. Plex HTPC)

#### Transport HUD layout and controls

*Already implemented here: 22 reference features.*

- **OK on the Subtitles / Audio discs is dead code — the track menu is unreachable by remote** — `blocker` / `small`
  Plex HTPC's CC and speaker glyphs open their pickers when activated. Ours draw and take focus, but the key handler cannot activate them: app.rs:1409 is an EMPTY `else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {}` arm that shadows the byte-identical arm at app.rs:1410 which actually calls track_menu::open_tab. Pressing OK on either disc does nothing — no menu, no pause, no log line.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/app.rs:1409 — delete the empty arm. No PMS endpoint or player-engine call involved.
  *Device:* none known — pure control flow in the SDL key handler.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim. rust-modules/src/app.rs:1405 handles `vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 && !ctrl.is_discs()`; app.rs:1409 is an empty `} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {` whose block closes on line 1410, so app.rs:1410-1413 (`track_menu::open_tab` + `route = Route::Player { overlay: Overlay::Menu }`) is unreachable for the ONLY condition that can still reach it (the discs). `git diff rust-modules/src/app.rs` confirms provenance: the pre-branch code was a single `if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {`, and the uncommitted skip-pill/Up-Next work split it into the guarded arm plus the stray empty one. Co

- **No play/pause transport button and no previous/next-item buttons — the entire CENTER cluster is missing** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC's centre cluster is |◀ / a large white FILLED circular play-pause (the only filled control on the HUD) / ▶|. We draw none of them. Play/pause exists only as an unlabelled fallthrough — OK when HUD focus is not on a control row (app.rs:1422-1430) or a pointer click on empty video (app.rs:1697-1705) — and the only play-state affordance drawn is a small NON-interactive Pause glyph beside the elapsed clock, documented at its call site as 'a state read-out, not an action toggle' (player_hud.rs:446-464). There is therefore no focusable, hit-testable play/pause anywhere, and no way to jump to the next or previous episode from the transport: Up Next only appears once the playhead is inside a credits marker AND a successor is queued (player_hud.rs:252-264), so mid-episode there is no next-item control at all, and previous-item does not exist in any form.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:333-486 for the drawn cluster + a hit-test beside `icon_hit` (player_hud.rs:289-297); ui/widgets.rs `CircleButton` already gives the disc look (focus-driven `ControlStyle::Accent` — the always-filled `Primary` style was retired in the 2026-08-13 palette sync). Next-item can reuse `route::up_next()` + `app.rs::play_up_next` (app.rs:824-845) unchanged. Previous-item needs `plex::Client::create_play_queue` (plex/timeline.rs:52-70) to also return the row BEFORE the selected one.
  *Device:* Play/pause and next-item are cheap: both already work through paths the auto-advance chain exercises (`player::pause`/`resume` and the stop+Load ritual in app.rs:824-845). Previous-item is the expensive one — starting a different item is a full engine teardown + fresh Starfish `Load` on the buffer-feed pipeline, and `next_after` deliberately DRAINS the queue rows rather than cloning them because 'a `Metadata` row carries the whole Media/Part/Stream/Role tree and this runs on the resolve worker on a 32-bit TV' (plex/timeline.rs:71-74), so retaining the predecessor row costs real heap on the ARM target.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player_hud.rs:385-392 is the entire control row and it is a 3-way `match slot` over `ControlSlot::{UpNext, Skip, Discs}` only; player_hud.rs:394-431 is the rail+knob, 433-464 the clocks + the state read-out, 467-485 the Info/Chapters pills. Nothing else is drawn. The Pause glyph is `icons::Icon::Pause` at player_hud.rs:462, inside a `if loading || paused` block whose comment at 446-448 says verbatim 'a state read-out, not an action toggle' — and `rg 'Icon::Play|Icon::Pause'` shows Icon::Play is never used in the player at all (only home.rs:441, detail.rs:834, info_panel.rs:185, card

- **No clock — nothing renders the time of day anywhere in the app** — `major` / `small`
  Plex HTPC puts the wall clock in the top-right corner over the video while the HUD is up ('6:53 PM'). We render no time of day at all, on any screen. There is also no derived 'ends at' readout, which is the other place Plex-family clients surface wall time in the player.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:333-486 (a top-right Label at theme::size::CAPTION, drawn only while the transport is up), plus a new wall-clock formatter beside `clock` in ui/fmt.rs.
  *Device:* The drawing is trivial, but READING the right time is not guaranteed on this device. The app now has a small synchronous luna-service client for the authenticated Key Manager service (`keymanager.rs`), but still has no settings-service path for the configured TV timezone. Reuse or generalize that transport before implementing the clock: `localtime_r` would fall back to /etc/localtime, which on this webOS 4.5 unit may not track the user's setting. `docs/agent-reference.md` already records a ~3h wall-clock skew observed on this TV, so a clock must be verified on-device before it is trusted; a UTC-looking clock over the video is worse than none.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `rg 'strftime|localtime|SystemTime|UNIX_EPOCH|gettimeofday|clock_gettime'` over rust-modules/src returns zero hits (the only matches are player/engine.rs:752 / player/ffi.rs:30,82 `sf_set_time_to_decode`, a Starfish PTS call). ui/fmt.rs:1-56 is the complete formatter set and `clock` (fmt.rs:40-48) takes a playback offset in ms. player_hud.rs draws nothing above SCR_H-470 except the StatusOverlay (359-365). TWO CORRECTIONS to device_risk, both of which make this cheaper than stated. (1) The '~3h wall-clock skew' recorded in `docs/agent-reference.md` is explicitly PMLOG's clock ('pmlog's wal

- **No quality badge — the quality picker and adaptive ladder are landed** — `major` / `small`
  Plex HTPC's left cluster carries a plain-text quality badge ('HD') that both shows the current tier and opens the Quality picker (Original / Convert Automatically / a bitrate ladder). **The picker landed 2026-08-23 (PR #57), and Auto landed 2026-08-24.** Still absent is the badge, and with it any indication in the player of whether this is a direct play, a progressive transcode, or adaptive HLS. Fixed modes feed their selected `Ceiling` into the established progressive path; Auto owns the separately measured segmented HLS path described below.
  *Where:* plex/transcoder.rs:74-98 (a quality field on TranscodeSpec feeding videoResolution/maxVideoBitrate), route.rs:523-652 (build_stream would have to be able to force a transcode where it currently direct-plays), route.rs:871-902 (`retranscode` already restarts a transcode at an offset, which is the restart-at-position mechanism a quality switch needs), and a new badge + Popover/TableView picker in ui/player_hud.rs's control row.
  *Device:* Real and now split by mode. Fixed-quality changes rebuild the progressive transcode and issue a fresh Load. Auto instead uses H.264/AAC MPEG-TS segments and keeps one Starfish Load while switching encoder/raster; the television dynamic-resolution spike proved 720p→1080p→720p and the shaped-link matrix proved the production sequence. The remaining badge is pure UI: `route::is_transcoding()` already knows the delivery class, but the transport HUD does not display it.
  *Verified:* The picker, ceilings and Auto ABR are landed. This row now tracks only the missing compact quality/delivery badge.

- **No More/kebab menu — there is no home for in-player settings** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC's right cluster ends in a vertical '⋮' that opens the More/Settings menu (quality, playback options, subtitle appearance/offset, audio sync, auto-play-next). We have no kebab and most of its typical contents are elsewhere or absent: subtitle offset lives in the Subtitles menu's Timing capsule and size/position/tone are Settings > Playback pickers, but there is no in-player home for them, no audio delay, no playback-speed control, and no in-player auto-play-next toggle (the Next episode preference lives in Settings > Playback; as audited, auto-advance was unconditional — ui/up_next.rs:28 hard-codes COUNTDOWN_MS = 10_000, which is still the countdown length).
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs's control row (a third slot) or a third tab pill at player_hud.rs:467-485, opening a ui/popover.rs + ui/table.rs panel exactly like ui/track_menu.rs:353-367. Subtitle offset lives in player/mod.rs's `subtitle_offset_ms`/`set_subtitle_offset`, driven from `ui::timing_capsule`; playback speed would need a Starfish rate call.
  *Device:* The menu shell itself is free (Popover + TableView already carry the choreography). Its plausible contents are not uniform: subtitle timing/tone/size/position are already client-side controls (Subtitles menu Timing row and Style pages, Settings > Playback) and were cheap; PLAYBACK SPEED is likely impossible — we drive StarfishMediaAPIs in BUFFERSTREAM buffer-feed mode where the feed loop paces on presented PTS against MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS (player/engine.rs:673, 707, 807), so a rate change means re-timing the whole feed pump rather than setting a property, and player/CLAUDE.md documents no rate call on the seam. Audio delay is similarly a feed-side re-time. Treat speed as out of scope until the seam is proven.
  *Verified:* UPDATED 2026-09-30. player_hud.rs:467-472 builds `tabs` as `["Info", "Chapters"]` (Chapters gated on `chapters_panel::has_chapters()`) and nothing else; info_panel.rs:48-50 `actions()` returns exactly ['From Beginning', 'Go to Show'/'Go to Movie']. `rg 'audio_delay|sync_offset|playback_speed|set_speed|aspect|zoom'` over rust-modules/src returns no relevant hits; subtitle offset, size, position and tone now do (`ui::timing_capsule`, `route::subtitle_size`/`subtitle_position`, `ui::track_menu`'s Style pages). PARTIAL worth recording on auto-play-next: it is NOT fully u

- **No queue / playlist view — we create a continuous PlayQueue and then discard it** — `minor` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC's right cluster has a stacked-lines-with-arrow glyph that opens the up-next queue. Every one of our playbacks already POSTs `/playQueues?continuous=1` and gets the show's remaining episodes back as full Metadata rows — and we throw all but ONE away. `next_after` (plex/timeline.rs:78-93) drains everything past the successor and returns just that row, so `route::up_next()` is a single episode, surfaced only during a credits marker.
  *Where:* plex/timeline.rs:52-70 (return the whole queue window, or at least N rows after the selected one), route.rs:381-387 + 828-863 (carry them through Plan/apply_plan), and a new horizontal strip modelled on ui/chapters_panel.rs:112-155 opened from a third control-row slot or tab.
  *Device:* Memory on the 32-bit ARM target is the whole risk, and the code already says so: plex/timeline.rs:71-74 explains the successor is pulled OUT of the list rather than cloned 'because a `Metadata` row carries the whole Media/Part/Stream/Role tree and this runs on the resolve worker on a 32-bit TV'. Holding a full season's rows plus their 16:9 stills (each a /photo/:/transcode GL texture through ui/widgets.rs::resolve_tex) is a measurable cost on a Mali TV that is simultaneously decoding 4K HEVC. Cap the window and reuse the chapters strip's `on_axis` culling.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. plex/timeline.rs:51-69 posts `/playQueues` with `continuous=1` (line 56) and computes `remaining = (play_queue_total_count - play_queue_selected_item_offset - 1).max(0)` at timeline.rs:65; `next_after` (timeline.rs:80-92) then does `items.drain(at + 1..).next()` — the successor plus every row behind it is dropped. `PlayQueueResult.remaining` (timeline.rs:160) is carried to route.rs and used ONLY in a log line (route.rs:442-447 `"playqueue: id={} item={} remaining={} next={}"`); `rg 'remaining' ui/` returns only up_next.rs's own `remaining_ms` countdown, fmt.rs's `time_left`, and unr

- **The Info / Chapters tab pills have no pointer hit-test, and the scrub grab band overlaps their top edge** — `minor` / `small`
  The bottom tabs are keyboard-only. The player's MOUSEBUTTONDOWN handler consults exactly two rects — the discs (`icon_hit`) and the scrub band (`scrub_hit`) — and everything else falls through to the play/pause toggle. So clicking 'Info' with the Magic Remote pointer PAUSES the video instead of opening the card. Worse, the two geometries collide: the scrub grab band runs cy 810..970 while the tabs occupy cy 949..1013, so a click in the top 21px of a pill is read as a scrub position and commits a seek to wherever along the rail the pointer happened to be.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:467-485 must publish its pill rects (the way ui/widgets.rs:531-536 `tab_pill_at` already does for the top tab row), and app.rs:1678-1706 must test them BEFORE `scrub_hit`; or narrow the band's lower bound at player_hud.rs:303.
  *Device:* none known — hit-test geometry only. Note the geometry is deliberately immediate-mode and shared between the draw and app.rs's hit-tests (ui/CLAUDE.md's 'deliberately immediate-mode' gotcha), so both sides must move together.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, geometry re-derived exactly. app.rs:1643-1707 is the whole player MOUSEBUTTONDOWN path: `modal_of(route)` arms for Menu/Info/Chapters, the stand-in arm at 1675-1677, then `_ =>` at 1678 computing `icon = player_hud::icon_hit(ctrl, cx, cy)` (1681) and `on_scrub = player_hud::scrub_hit(cx, cy)` (1682-1683), with `icon` tested first, `on_scrub` second, and the play/pause toggle at 1698-1705 as the fallthrough. There is no tab rect anywhere in that path. Overlap arithmetic verified against consts.rs:18-19 (SCR_W 1920 / SCR_H 1080): scrub_hit band = `cy > SCR_H - 270.0 && cy < SCR_H - 11

- **The episode metadata line is missing the air date and the runtime** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex HTPC's second line for an episode is 'It's Like the Flu • S2 E2 • Sep 23, 2021 • 52 min' — episode title, season/episode, ORIGINAL AIR DATE and RUNTIME. Ours is just 'S1, E1 · Episode Name' (player_hud.rs:372): no air date and no runtime. The air date is fetched and parsed but never reaches the HUD — `Detail.aired` exists (metadata.rs:212) while `NowPlaying` (metadata.rs:255-267), which is what the HUD reads, has no `aired` field at all. Runtime IS on NowPlaying as `dur_ms` (metadata.rs:263) and simply is not drawn. The movie case is fine — route.rs:786 builds 'year · rating · runtime' exactly as the reference does.
  *Where:* metadata.rs:255-307 (add `aired` to NowPlaying and copy it in sync_now_playing), ui/fmt.rs (a shared 'Sep 23, 2021' formatter beside dur_short — PMS returns `originallyAvailableAt` as ISO 'YYYY-MM-DD'), ui/player_hud.rs:371-377 to join the parts with the same ' · ' separator and settle on one kicker colour.
  *Device:* none known — the field is already in the PMS response the detail fetch parses; no extra round trip.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED for the HUD, with one correction. player_hud.rs:371-377 draws `format!("S{}, E{} \u{b7} {}", n.season, n.index, n.ep_title)` and nothing more; `Detail.aired` exists at metadata.rs:212 (filled at 326 from `originally_available_at`) but `NowPlaying` (metadata.rs:255-267) has no `aired` field and `sync_now_playing`'s episode arm (metadata.rs:279-291) does not copy it. `dur_ms` IS on NowPlaying (metadata.rs:263) and is undrawn in the HUD. Movie branch confirmed fine (route.rs:786 builds 'year · rating · dur_short'). The colour asymmetry is real: white/TEXT_PRIMARY at player_hud.rs:373 vs

- **No chapter or intro/credits markers on the scrubber rail** — `minor` / `medium`
  Plex clients tick chapter boundaries (and, on servers with them, intro/credits segments) directly on the rail so a scrub can be aimed. We draw a bare two-tone rail. Both data sets are already in memory during playback — `Detail.chapters` (metadata.rs:231) and `metadata::playing_markers()`, which the Skip pill consumes every frame (player_hud.rs:271) — so this is a draw-only addition, not a fetch.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:412-418, drawing thin ticks between the track and the fill. NB chapters must come from the PLAYING leaf, not `metadata::current()` — during a show-page episode play `current()` is the SHOW (the reason ui/track_menu.rs:30-35 and ui/skip_pill.rs:57-59 both call out this exact identity trap), and ui/chapters_panel.rs:34 currently reads `current()`.
  *Device:* Drawing is free. The one cost is fill-rate: these are extra small quads over the transparent UI plane composited above the video, and ui-fillrate work on this Mali part has already been a tuning problem — batch them into the existing rail pass rather than issuing a draw per tick.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player_hud.rs:412 (track), 414-418 (fill), 421-431 (knob) is the entire rail draw — no ticks, no segment bands. `rg chapters ui/player_hud.rs` hits only the `has_chapters()` tab gate at line 468. Both data sets confirmed in memory during playback: markers via `metadata::playing_markers()` (metadata.rs:441-443, read every frame through `active_marker()` at 172-179 → `player_hud::slot()` at 271), chapters via `metadata::current().chapters` (metadata.rs:231, chapters_panel.rs:34/44/91/116). IMPORTANT CORRECTION that raises the effort above 'draw-only': the auditor's own note says chapt

- **No scrub preview thumbnails** — `minor` / `large`
  Plex clients show a preview frame above the scrubber while seeking (from the server's BIF index). We show only a numeric clock at the playhead — a blind fixed-step tap (the Skip interval, 10 s by default) or a 140x hold-scrub with no visual target. On a device whose seeks are expensive (each is a stream reopen + prime), a preview is worth more here than on a client that can seek instantly.
  *Where:* A new fetch beside plex/transcoder.rs's image_transcode_path (GET /library/parts/{partId}/indexes/sd/{ms}, or the BIF index), the part id already lives in route.rs::cur_part_id (route.rs:88-90), and a preview card drawn above the knob in ui/player_hud.rs:419-431 via ui/widgets.rs::resolve_tex.
  *Device:* Substantial. (1) Our HTTP client is a raw-socket, Content-Length/close-delimited GET with no chunked decoding (stream.rs) — a BIF blob or per-offset JPEG must be fetched off the SDL loop through the poster worker, never inline, or every scrub tick parks the frame loop. (2) Each preview is a fresh GL texture upload on the Mali part WHILE the video plane is decoding, and synchronous poster uploads are already the documented cause of scroll judder (the /tmp/nativejelly-framedrop breakdown exists for exactly this). (3) The preview index does not exist unless the server generated it, so the control must degrade silently.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `rg 'bif|indexes=|/indexes/|BIF'` over rust-modules/src returns nothing — no index fetch, no BIF parser, no per-offset image request. player_hud.rs:394-445 draws rail, knob and clocks with nothing above them; the scrub preview is purely `TX.scrub_ns` (player_hud.rs:399) plus the frozen `seek_display_ns()` while loading (403-409), rendered as the numeric clock at 436. The reuse path the auditor names is real and present: `Client::image_transcode_path` at plex/transcoder.rs:52-62, the async poster worker behind `widgets::resolve_tex` (widgets.rs:14-23 → posters::poster_key/poster_get)

- **The played portion of the scrubber is white, not amber — and it bypasses the rail token that exists for it** — `polish` / `small`
  Plex HTPC's played portion is AMBER against a light-grey remainder; ours is white. We already own the amber (`theme::RESUME_FILL` #fab82e, theme.rs:162-163) and use it as 'the ONE progress language' on every poster (ui/widgets.rs:48-63), so the player rail is the one place the product's progress colour is not applied. Compounding it, the fill does not use `theme::RAIL_FILL` — the token that exists precisely for 'played/filled portion of a rail' — but reuses the text colour: player_hud.rs:342 binds `let white = theme::TEXT_PRIMARY` and player_hud.rs:415/417 fill the rail with it. That is two near-identical values for one role, which ui/CLAUDE.md rule 1 explicitly forbids.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:415-418 (the fill colour) and player_hud.rs:423-431 (the knob, if it should follow). Decide in theme.rs whether the player rail's played state is RAIL_FILL or RESUME_FILL and document the rung.
  *Device:* none known — a token swap. Verify on-device: it is drawn over the transparent UI plane against live video, and theme.rs's rasterization/dither notes apply to large flat fills.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED as to the defect, but ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS WRONG. Verified: player_hud.rs:342 `let white = theme::TEXT_PRIMARY;`, track drawn with `theme::RAIL_TRACK` at 344/412, fill drawn with `white` at 415 and 417, and the knob at 424-430 also uses `white`. theme.rs:157-166 defines RAIL_TRACK [1,1,1,0.20], RAIL_BUFFERED [1,1,1,0.28], RAIL_FILL [1,1,1,0.95] ('Played/filled portion of a rail'), RESUME_FILL [0.98,0.72,0.18,0.95]. RESUME_FILL is indeed 'the ONE progress language' on posters (widgets.rs:61, card_row.rs:303/324, library.rs:793). CORRECTION: the claim '`grep -rn RAIL_FILL` finds th

- **Elapsed rides the moving playhead instead of being pinned far-left, and the remaining label's width is estimated rather than measured** — `polish` / `small`
  Plex HTPC pins elapsed at the far left under the rail and remaining at the far right, both fixed. Ours centres the elapsed clock ON the playhead so it slides the whole width of the bar (player_hud.rs:436), and hides the remaining label entirely once the two would collide (player_hud.rs:440-445) — so near the end of a movie the remaining time simply vanishes. The collision test itself is approximate: `rem_w` is `chars * CAPTION * 0.52` (player_hud.rs:438) rather than a `text::text_width` measure, even though `draw_clock` two lines above does exactly that measurement for the elapsed label. Ours also prefixes remaining with '-' (player_hud.rs:28-35) where the reference shows a bare '50:23'.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:433-445 — pin the elapsed label at `sx` and the remaining at `sx + sw` (both then measurable once, no collision test at all), or keep the tracking label and measure `rem` with the same template trick `draw_clock` already uses.
  *Device:* none known. The moving-elapsed behaviour is arguably better during a hold-scrub, so this is a deliberate-divergence call, not an obvious defect — but the vanishing remaining label and the unmeasured width are both real.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED line for line. player_hud.rs:436 `draw_clock(p, &fmt_time(dispos, false), hx, ty, ...)` centres the elapsed label on `hx = sx + fw` (the playhead, line 421), clamped only to the bar's own extents. player_hud.rs:438 `let rem_w = rem.chars().count() as f32 * theme::size::CAPTION as f32 * 0.52;` is the estimate; 440 `let rem_shown = el_r + 20.0 < rem_l;` is the gate; 441-445 skips the label entirely when it fails. The measured alternative is two lines above in the same file: `draw_clock` (player_hud.rs:317-326) builds an all-'0' template and calls `crate::text::text_width`, precisely so

- **The HUD title is never elided and rides a 128-byte C buffer that truncates mid-UTF-8** — `polish` / `small`
  Both title lines are drawn with a bare `Painter::text` and no width budget (player_hud.rs:373-380), so a long show or movie title runs right across the bar toward the control row — the title's usable width is only ~1600px (x=90 to CTRL_RIGHT-CTRL_PAIR_W=1690) at HUD_TITLE_SZ 54. Underneath, the movie/pre-roll title lives in a fixed `[c_char; 128]` (route.rs:47) written by `cbuf::set`, which truncates at `cap-1` BYTES with no char-boundary check (cbuf.rs:26-35) — so a Cyrillic or CJK title over ~63 characters is cut mid-codepoint and handed to SDL2_ttf as invalid UTF-8. The context line is a 96-byte buffer with the same property.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:371-381 (elide both lines to the measured budget, the way ui/up_next.rs:177 does), and cbuf.rs:26-35 (back the truncation off to the previous char boundary).
  *Device:* none known, but it is only visible on-device — the 128-byte truncation needs a real long-title item and a panel capture to confirm what SDL2_ttf 2.0.x does with a severed codepoint.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED both halves. `rg elide ui/player_hud.rs` finds only a doc-comment mention at line 170 (in `ctrl_slot`'s memo rationale) — no call; player_hud.rs:372-380 draws both branches through bare `p.text` with no width budget, at HUD_TITLE_SZ 54 (declared 25) from SB_X 90 (142), with the control row's left edge at `CTRL_RIGHT - CTRL_PAIR_W` = 1840 - 150 = 1690 (160-162), so ~1600px of usable width and nothing enforcing it. route.rs:47-48 declares `static mut TITLE: [c_char; 128]` and `CTXLINE: [c_char; 96]`, written at route.rs:743-744 via `set_c` = `cbuf::set`; cbuf.rs:27-36 is `let n = b.len

- **The bottom scrim is far heavier than the reference's, and the focus model is a vertical stack rather than one horizontal control row** — `polish` / `medium`
  Two deliberate-looking divergences worth recording. (1) Plex HTPC puts NO heavy scrim behind the transport — the controls sit on the video with only a subtle bottom gradient. Ours is a 470px gradient reaching alpha 0.86 at the bottom edge (player_hud.rs:337-340), which reads as a dark band rather than a wash. (2) Plex HTPC's focus walks HORIZONTALLY across one control row (CC, audio, quality, prev, play, next, queue, kebab). Ours is a three-row vertical stack — control row above the scrubber, tabs below — with LEFT/RIGHT only moving within a row (app.rs:1330-1370, 1530-1535), so the discs, the scrubber and the Info/Chapters pills are three separate stops reached with UP/DOWN.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:337-340 for the scrim alpha; the focus model would be a rework of app.rs:1330-1370 plus the control-row layout in player_hud.rs:274-297 and 467-485.
  *Device:* The scrim change is free and is the one worth doing — the UI plane is transparent over the hardware video plane, so a lighter scrim also means less large-quad fill, which is the axis this Mali part is sensitive to (see theme.rs's SURFACE_APP GL_DITHER note and the ui-fillrate history). The focus rework is not a device question at all, and the current stack is coherent with the rest of the product's Apple-TV language — treat it as a design decision to make explicitly rather than an outright gap.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED as recorded divergences. Scrim verified verbatim at player_hud.rs:337-340: `let clr = theme::scrim_black(0.0); let drk = theme::scrim_black(0.86); p.rect(Rect::new(0.0, SCR_H - 470.0, SCR_W, 470.0), 0.0, clr, drk, 0.0);` — a 470px full-width gradient to alpha 0.86, drawn unconditionally including in Info mode (it sits before the `if transport` at 368). Focus ring verified at app.rs:1333-1370: UP walks 0→1 (scrubber→control row), 2→0 (tabs→scrubber), and 1→hide (1344-1347); DOWN walks 0→2, 1→0, and 2 stays (1350-1354). LEFT/RIGHT clamps within the row only — `hud_nav.btn` against `ctr

#### Video quality / bitrate ladder and direct-play policy

*Already implemented here: 14 reference features.*

- **~~There is no Quality picker anywhere in the app~~ — LANDED 2026-08-23 (PR #57)** — was `blocker` / `medium`
  **Read the row below as the gap it WAS.** The picker exists: `route::Quality`, Auto plus five rungs, reached from the existing `…` overflow popover (`ui/more_menu.rs`) as a root "Quality ›" row, above Options, that opens a Quality page of rungs (a page push inside the popover) rather than a second modal. The choice persists as `Session::playback_quality`; legacy sessions remain Original and fresh installs start on Auto. Fixed rungs continue through the proven progressive path. Auto first preserves Original on Local or on a direct Remote whose completed bounded actual-file sample sustains source consumption; no fixed bitrate-headroom multiplier is applied. Otherwise it uses segmented HLS, measures transfer rate, segment-production ratio and normalized A/V buffer duration, and transactionally replaces one fixed-rendition PMS encoder with another without issuing a new Starfish Load. LG #43 CASE1 is device-passing; see `docs/lg-self-checklist.md`.

  Plex HTPC opens a full-screen Quality modal from the transport and lets the user pick a bitrate/resolution tier mid-playback. We have no such screen, no such control, and no such concept: the in-player overlays are exactly Menu (audio/subs), Info and Chapters, and the transport's right-hand control row holds exactly two focusable discs (Subtitles, Audio).
  *Where:* New ui/quality_menu.rs composed from ui/popover.rs + ui/table.rs (exactly the pattern ui/track_menu.rs uses); a fifth `Overlay::Quality` in app.rs:579-584 with its key/pointer arms alongside app.rs:1216-1330 and app.rs:2142-2160; the commit routed into route.rs beside `commit_audio_selection` (route.rs:922-935). No new PMS endpoint — it re-registers through the existing `/video/:/transcode/universal/decision` + `start.mkv` (plex/transcoder.rs:129-137).
  *Device:* The picker itself is ordinary TableView/Popover UI. Fixed-rung changes still rebuild the progressive transcode and issue a fresh Load; Auto quality changes instead prime a complete HLS segment, feed the new in-band H.264/AAC configuration on the normalized timeline, and keep the existing Starfish Load. The dynamic-resolution spike and all four shaped-network legs passed on the television.
  *Verified:* LANDED and device-measured 2026-08-24. The remaining HUD gap is a compact quality/delivery badge; the quality control itself is reachable from the existing `…` menu.

- **~~The transcode ladder is one hard-coded target: maxVideoBitrate=60000 at 3840x2160, and TranscodeSpec cannot express any other~~ — LANDED 2026-08-23 (PR #57)** — was `blocker` / `small`
  `TranscodeSpec` carries `ceiling: Option<Ceiling>`; `None` (Auto) resolves to `Ceiling::NATIVE_4K`, which is those two literals byte for byte, so the default query is unchanged and a host test pins that. The *Where* below is close to what landed — read `Ceiling` for the "`max_bitrate_kbps` + `resolution` (or a `Quality` enum)" it asks for. Its second sentence — *"branch on them … so the remux branch is only taken at Original"* — is the half that got sharper: the remux is refused for any source the rung cannot carry, which is not the same as "only at Original" (a small file under a low rung still remuxes, and should).

  Plex derives a descending ladder (20/12/10/8 Mbps 4K, 4/3/2 Mbps 720p, 1.5 Mbps 480p …) and sends the chosen tier as `maxVideoBitrate` + `videoResolution` on the decision and the start URL. Every re-encode we request is the same single tier, and the request struct has no field to vary it.
  *Where:* Add `max_bitrate_kbps: i64` + `resolution: &str` (or a `Quality` enum) to plex/params.rs:12-27; branch on them at plex/transcoder.rs:79-83 so the re-encode carries the picked tier and the remux branch is only taken at Original; store the selection next to CUR_REMUX in route.rs:17 and feed it through `transcode_spec` (route.rs:136-145) so `retranscode`, `transcode_seek` and the first `build_stream` all rebuild the identical query.
  *Device:* None known for the plumbing. Two device notes on the values chosen: (a) the sink envelope in the Load payload is fixed at 3840x2160 and the pipeline reads true dims from the SPS (player/engine.rs:288-292), so a lower-resolution tier needs no payload change; (b) `adaptiveResolution` is only added when the source fps is known, which is the direct-play case (player/engine.rs:181-191, and route.rs:594 only sets `plan.fps` on the direct-play branch), so a transcode tier change must go through a fresh Load rather than being switched inside one — which `reload_transcode` already does.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim. plex/transcoder.rs:79-83 is exactly `if s.remux { q.int("directStreamAudio",1) } else { q.str("videoResolution","3840x2160").int("maxVideoBitrate",60000) }` — unconditional, no input. TranscodeSpec (plex/params.rs:12-27) carries only rating_key/session/remux/audio_stream_id/subtitle_stream_id/offset_secs. PARTIAL worth knowing: the plumbing pattern is already established — `remux` and `offset_secs` are both per-call varying fields, and all three rebuild sites funnel through the single `transcode_spec()` constructor (route.rs:136-145), called from build_stream (route.rs:641)

- **The source bitrate, width/height and videoResolution are not in the data model** — HALF TRUE since PR #57; `major` / `small`
  **`Detail` carries all three** (`video_resolution`/`width`/`height`/`bitrate`, plus `video: Option<Stream>` with the video track's OWN bitrate), and `route::source_kbps` reads them — which is how the quality ceiling measures a source at all. **`PlayingItem` still carries none of them**, and that is a live consequence rather than a cosmetic one: the ceiling therefore measures a source only when the loaded `Detail` describes the leaf being played (a movie's own page, or a show page's on-deck episode — `route::detail_describes`). An episode reached another way, a season list or Up Next, measures 0 and fails closed, so a selected rung transcodes it even when it would have fitted. Closing it is the three assignments this row's *Where* already names, in `metadata.rs`: the field, `fetch_playing_item`, `cached_playing`.

  Plex's first ladder row is the item's own bitrate and resolution labelled Original, and its transport badge ("HD") is derived from the same fields. Our Media DTO parses only videoCodec, audioCodec and Part[] — the numbers the reference client's whole ladder is built from are dropped on the floor even though PMS sends them.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs:197-219 (add the lenient-`de_i64` fields), then carry them into metadata.rs:313-345 (`Detail`) / metadata.rs:424-430 (`PlayingItem`) and pms.rs:133-139 (`PmsMovie`) so both the ladder builder and any badge can read them. No new endpoint — the fields already arrive on `/library/metadata/{rk}` (plex/library.rs:59-65).
  *Device:* None known. Pure DTO work; the fields are already on the wire in every response we parse, and `de_i64` (plex/models.rs:371-391) already tolerates the string-encoded forms PMS emits, so adding them cannot break an existing parse.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `Media` (plex/models.rs:197-205) is exactly videoCodec + audioCodec + Part[]; `MediaPart` (plex/models.rs:207-219) is id/key/decision/Stream[] — no bitrate, width, height, videoResolution, container, size, videoProfile. Checked the UNCOMMITTED diff too (`git diff rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs`): the only additions this branch makes are playQueueTotalCount/playQueueSelectedItemOffset/playQueueItemID and the Marker DTO — nothing dimensional. PARTIAL, and it is more than the auditor credits: the per-STREAM descriptive fields DO exist and reach the UI — Stream.frameRate (models.rs:245

- **~~There is no way back to direct play mid-playback~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31**
  Manual Original and Auto recovery now return from HLS to direct Part playback or a video-copy remux at the retained position. The working HLS resource remains alive until decoded Original frames commit the handoff; an open failure restores HLS instead of producing a terminal dead route.
  *Historical proposal:* a `redirect_play(offset_secs)`-style fresh Load was the intended shape; the landed transaction additionally preserves exact PMS resource ownership and rollback identities.
  *Device:* Moderate and specific: going from transcode back to direct play changes the Load payload's codec (typically ac3/h264 output back to the file's hevc + eac3), which is exactly the case `reload_transcode`'s doc says must be a fresh Load, not a flush+refeed (player/engine.rs:495-499) — feeding a different codec into a configured pipeline stalls it. `reload_at` gives that fresh Load, but the direct-play branch also re-arms an `av_seek` on the reopened socket (player/engine.rs:450-462), so the restart cost is a reopen + seek to the offset (~700ms-1s on 4K HEVC per the SEEK_STUCK_MS note at player/pump.rs:93). Also: leaving a live transcode without stopping it leaks a server-side encoder unless the new path calls `transcode_stop` (plex/transcoder.rs:139-145) — `retranscode` deliberately does not, because it reuses the session.
  *Historical audit evidence:* the cited call graph described the pre-recovery implementation and is retained only as the gap that the transactional handoff replaced.

- **No settings for Allow Direct Play / Allow Direct Stream / Force Direct Play — the policy is hardwired and unreachable by the user** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex clients expose these three toggles and they change the decision the server is asked for. We send a fixed `directPlay=0&directStream=1` on every transcode request and a fixed `directPlay=1&directStream=1&directStreamAudio=1` on every MDE ask, and the local gates are unconditional. The Settings shell now exists, but has no playback-policy section or backing preferences for these values.
  *Where:* Add a Playback section to `screens/settings.rs`; read its persisted values at plex/transcoder.rs:68-98 and at the route.rs:561-585 gates.
  *Device:* HIGH for one of the three, and this is the important part: "Force Direct Play" is genuinely unsafe on this device. The gates it would bypass are not policy, they are physics — route.rs:571-576 refuses AV1/VP9/MPEG-2 because the buffer-feed Load payload only ever declares H264 or H265 (player/engine.rs:22-31, 272-296), and route.rs:577-578 refuses non-MKV because the reopen-per-seek HTTP AVIO cannot sustain mp4's per-sample random access (the comment records it dying after AU#0 with a black screen). A Force toggle that reached those paths would produce a black screen with no error. If the toggle ships, it must sit ABOVE the server ask and BELOW the two local gates. "Allow Direct Stream" (off = force a full re-encode) and "Allow Direct Play" (off = always ask for a transcode) are both safe here — they only ever move work to the server.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED on the missing-policy half. Fixed params: plex/transcoder.rs:74-75 (directPlay=0, directStream=1) and 110-113 (hasMDE=1, directPlay=1, directStream=1, directStreamAudio=1) — never varied, no caller input. Local gates route.rs:561-585 take no user input. `screens/settings.rs` (`ui/settings.rs` before phase 5b, 2026-09-07) has no playback-policy rows. The auditor's HIGH device_risk on Force Direct Play is CORRECT and I verified the mechanism: route.rs:571-57

- **No media-version picker: mediaIndex is hard-coded to 0 and every consumer takes Media[0]** — `major` / `medium`
  A Plex item can carry several `Media[]` versions (the documented example is a 4K HDR original plus a 1080p copy), and clients let the user choose which version plays. We always take the first and always tell the transcoder `mediaIndex=0`, so a library with optimized versions silently plays only one of them — and the cheap 1080p version that would avoid a transcode entirely is invisible.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs:189-195 (a `media_at(i)` alongside `first_part`), plex/params.rs:12-27 (add `media_index` to TranscodeSpec) and plex/transcoder.rs:71/107 (send it); the choice belongs in route.rs's `build_stream` (route.rs:523-652) so the direct-play gates evaluate the chosen version's container/codecs, with the picker itself sharing the quality modal.
  *Device:* Low, and it actually reduces device risk: a 1080p h264/aac MKV sibling is often a version this pipeline can direct-play when the 4K original cannot (route.rs:561-585). The one trap is that `part_id_of`/`part_is_mkv` (route.rs:703-718) and the PUT stream selection (route.rs:329-343) must all be re-derived from the chosen Media's Part — mixing version 0's part id with version 1's stream would burn the wrong subtitle, which is the same class of bug the route.rs:524-530 comment records.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `.int("mediaIndex", 0)` at plex/transcoder.rs:71 (transcode_query, shared by transcode_decision AND transcode_start_url) and plex/transcoder.rs:107 (mde_decision). `Metadata::first_part` (plex/models.rs:189-195) is `media.first().and_then(|m| m.part.first())` — there is no media_at/version accessor anywhere. Every reader takes the first: route.rs:271, 302, 407, 410; metadata.rs:313, 335, 405, 579, 590; pms.rs:134. Two readers the auditor missed, both of which widen the change: metadata.rs:477 (`fetch_playing_item` derives the whole track store from `first_part()`), and metadata.rs:5

- **A failed manual/fixed direct play is not automatically converted** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex clients can retry with a transcode (or a lower quality) when direct play fails. We surface the diagnosed failure and let the viewer press OK to retry the current policy or choose a lower rung; we do not silently choose a different manual/fixed policy for them.
  *Where:* Any future automatic policy belongs before the terminal Error publication in `player/pump.rs`; the explicit recovery already goes through `app::retry_failed_playback` and a fresh `route::retry_current_play` resolve.
  *Device:* Medium: the retry must be latched per item or it becomes an infinite reload loop against a server that is also failing, and each attempt costs a full teardown (thread joins + Starfish destruct, player/engine.rs:529+). It must also distinguish a producer failure (`demux_failed`, ff.rs:1343/1684 — retryable, the server can transcode it) from a transport failure like a dead PMS (not retryable the same way). The one thing that makes this cheap here is that `retranscode` already forces the hevc/ac3 output and rebuilds the Load payload from the decision (route.rs:887-893), so the retry lands on the known-good transcode path.
  *Verified:* PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2026-08-31. The failure gates still terminate the failed Engine, but the Error read-out now offers OK quality/retry and BACK; the retry re-resolves the same Plex item at the retained position with the retained audio/subtitle selection. Cold Auto Original additionally retries its retained HLS bootstrap without user input, and a runtime HLS→Original experiment rolls back to its held HLS route. What remains is the narrower policy gap in the heading: a manual/fixed direct failure is not automatically converted before asking the viewer.

- **No transport affordance to open a quality picker from (no HD/4K badge, no quality pill)** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex HTPC hangs the Quality modal off an "HD" badge in the transport, which doubles as a read-out of what is currently playing. Our transport shows title, context line, scrubber, clocks, two discs and the Info/Chapters pills — nothing about the stream itself.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:333-486 for the badge (the shared chip leaf `widgets::badge` with `BadgeStyle::Outlined` already exists, ui/info_panel.rs:107-109 shows the call shape), plus a pointer hit-test beside `icon_hit` (ui/player_hud.rs:289-297) and the corresponding app.rs click arm. Label text comes from the fields added in the DTO gap above.
  *Device:* None known — pure 2D drawing on the GLES plane at the authored 1920x1080. Note the crispness contract: the badge is 1:1-texel text and must snap its origin (`docs/agent-reference.md` rasterization note, gfx::snap).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. Read draw_hud in full (ui/player_hud.rs:333-486): scrim, StatusOverlay, title/context block, the ControlSlot row, scrubber, two clocks, pause/spinner glyph, Info(/Chapters) TabPills — nothing about the stream. Movie context line is year·rating·runtime (route.rs:785-787); episode line is the S/E kicker (ui/player_hud.rs:371-377). No HD/4K badge anywhere else in the app either: the only `widgets::badge` call sites are ui/info_panel.rs:265-277 (rating/Dolby/CC/SDH/AD) and ui/detail.rs:1593 (accessibility chips); the detail About block lists Released/Run Time/Rated/Regions only (ui/deta

- **~~No "automatically adjust quality"~~ — LANDED and device-passing 2026-08-24** — was `minor` / `large`
  PMS protocol probing established that this server exposes one fixed rendition per HLS encoder, not a client-selectable master ladder or an autonomously changing rendition. `hls.rs` therefore parses the measured safe subset of the master/media playlists; `ff.rs` opens a fresh FFmpeg context per MPEG-TS segment and maps every segment onto one content timeline; `abr/` owns the policy. **The controller was rewritten on 2026-08-25** — it was three signals with fast-down/slow-up counter gates, and it is now feasibility filtering, estimates that carry their own uncertainty, a starvation horizon in seconds, and utility-based Original/HLS mode selection. Design: `docs/adaptive-playback.md`.
  A quality change is a transaction: create a separately named PMS encoder, download and validate complete decodable candidate media, then publish/feed it and exact-clean both server resource identities belonging to the retired encoder. Rejected candidates leave the active rung unchanged. Upshifts spend only measured disposable reserve; ordinary downshifts preserve their funded segment boundary. If the current bag cannot replay its measured chronology (`B < R_o`) or the main thread has already observed `B = 0`, a terminal-floor response keeps running because no cheaper retry exists; a complete funded floor may commit as “best available” even when it is not sustainable. Incomplete prefixes are right-censored, never path-capacity samples. After HLS recovers and the reserve funds source setup + source body while preserving `max(R_s,D)`, Auto can re-measure the exact live resource and select Original without a fixed timer or probe count.
  *Verified:* host controller, parser, transport-deadline, timestamp and lifecycle tests pass — and the rewrite's model (estimators, starvation arithmetic, end-to-end acquisition non-double-counting, the terminal-floor exception, all three Original exits, the recovery confidence ladder, hysteresis, the bootstrap table) is host-graded too. On the television, 512 Kbps / 1 Mbps / 7 Mbps / 17.5 Mbps settled at 320 Kbps / 720 Kbps / 4 Mbps / 8 Mbps with actual decoded rasters changing accordingly, inside one Starfish Load — **on the six-rung ladder of that day**; the 17.5 Mbit/s leg would land on the 10 Mbps rung today, which is the one settle value the rewrite is expected to change and has NOT been re-measured on a device. Full duration, seek, A/V priming and a live high-to-512 Kbps collapse were also exercised. Protocol evidence and limitations are in `docs/pms-hls-protocol-probe.md`.

- **~~No quality preference is persisted~~, and no local-vs-remote distinction** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex clients keep separate local and remote quality preferences. We now persist one install-wide mode (Auto / Original / fixed rung) and apply it to future plays, but do not keep separate local and remote choices.
  *Where:* Add a `prefs` field to the serde `Session` at plex/session.rs:39-56 (it already round-trips through `load`/`save` at plex/session.rs:109-150, so this is nearly free); read it in `build_stream` (route.rs:523-652) when constructing the first `TranscodeSpec`; the local/remote branch keys on `Connection.local` (plex/account.rs:177).
  *Device:* None known. The session file already survives reinstall by living outside the app dir (plex/session.rs:32-37), so a pref stored there behaves the same. One TV-specific caution: the file is written on the dev partition and a launch can race a deploy, so the pref read must tolerate a missing/partial file exactly as `load` already does.
  *Verified:* UPDATED 2026-08-24. `Session.playback_quality` is soft-deserialized and distinguishes an old missing field from a fresh explicit default; `route::set_quality` persists it and boot restores it. The remaining gap is the single global value: connection tier is still not a preference key.

- **The advertised transcode target is HEVC/AC3 only — the low rungs of any ladder have no h264 fallback** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex's ladder produces h264 at the lower tiers (4/3/2 Mbps 720p, 1.5 Mbps 480p). Our profile advertises exactly one transcode target, HEVC+AC3, so every tier we could ask for would be requested as HEVC — the most expensive thing the server can encode, and the one thing a mis-set server preference silently refuses.
  *Where:* plex/transcoder.rs:36-46 — make `profile_extra` take the chosen tier and append an h264/ac3 target (and drop the 4K upper bounds) for tiers at or below 1080p. Note it feeds BOTH the transcode request and the MDE direct-play ask, so any change is also a change to the direct-play verdict.
  *Device:* Low on the client — the pipeline decodes h264 natively and `PAYLOAD_V`/`build_av_payload` already select the H264 codec string from the decision output (player/engine.rs:272-296). The risk is server-side and already documented in this repo's memory: with the target left HEVC-only and the server's HEVC-encoding preference not set to Always, a low tier comes back as audio with no video, which on this pipeline presents as a permanently black video plane rather than an error.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `profile_extra()` (plex/transcoder.rs:36-46) is a fixed format! with exactly one add-transcode-target: `container=matroska&videoCodec=hevc&audioCodec=ac3` (lines 43-44). It takes no arguments and is called identically from both request builders (transcoder.rs:93 for the transcode ask, transcoder.rs:120 for the MDE ask) — so any change is indeed a change to the direct-play verdict too, as the auditor warns. The doc comment at transcoder.rs:31-35 records the server-side trap (HEVC encoding must be 'Always' or PMS drops video and sends audio only), and the repo memory [[server-hevc-enc

- **Nothing in the UI tells the user whether the stream is direct-playing, remuxing or transcoding** — `polish` / `small`
  Plex surfaces the delivery mode (Direct Play / Direct Stream / Transcode) to the user; it is the context that makes a quality picker legible. We know the answer precisely and log it, but never show it.
  *Where:* ui/info_panel.rs:239-279 (one more `meta_badge`) or the transport badge from the HD-affordance gap above; the value is `route::is_transcoding()` + `CUR_REMUX`, both already exported or one accessor away in route.rs:60-67.
  *Device:* None known — reads two existing flags on the main thread and draws one chip.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. The state is authoritative and cheap — route::is_transcoding() (route.rs:63-67) and CUR_REMUX (route.rs:17) — and its complete reader set is policy/plumbing only: route.rs:246, 854, 882, 923, 943; player/pump.rs:122; player/engine.rs:454; ui/track_menu.rs:74 (which subtitle rows to offer, a behaviour change, not a read-out). Grepping the whole ui/ tree for 'Direct Play'/'Transcode'/'Remux' as display strings returns nothing. PARTIAL: the verdict IS observable off-device — logged at route.rs:282-288 ('decision: part=… -> DIRECT PLAY|TRANSCODE') and at route.rs:896-900 for a retransco

#### The play queue / Up Next list overlay

*Already implemented here: 16 reference features.*

- **There is no queue overlay at all — no Overlay variant, no transport tab, no glyph, no screen** — `blocker` / `large`
  Plex HTPC opens a full-screen queue list from a transport glyph. We have four player routes (`Overlay::{None,Menu,Info,Chapters}`) and exactly two bottom tabs ("Info", "Chapters"); nothing in the app can display the play queue. The only queue-derived UI is the single-item Up Next tile in the control row, and it only appears during a credits marker.
  *Where:* New `ui/queue_panel.rs` (mirroring `ui/chapters_panel.rs`'s Popover+modal shape), a new `Overlay::Queue` + `Modal::Queue` arm in `app.rs:579-616`, its key arm beside `app.rs:1292-1329`, and a third tab in `ui/player_hud.rs:467-485`. Needs no new PMS endpoint if gap #2 is fixed (the rows already arrive in the `POST /playQueues` response).
  *Device:* Low-to-moderate, all fill-rate. A full-screen dimmed panel over the video plane is the same composite the track menu already does (`ui/popover.rs:44-51` draws `Rect::FULL` scrim on the root painter), and the UI surface is already forced non-opaque per frame while playing (`system.rs`). The Mali cost is a full-screen scrim + ~6 visible 16:9 textures; `TableView::draw` already scissor-clips (`ui/table.rs:251,366`) and `ui/on_axis` culls, so the overdraw is bounded. Verify against `tests/run.py --fps-player` — the player-tier FPS floors are the real gate, and this is the largest overlay the player would have drawn.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `enum Overlay { None, Menu, Info, Chapters }` at app.rs:579-584; `modal_of` maps exactly those three panels (app.rs:608-616); the tab list is `["Info", "Chapters"]` at player_hud.rs:468-472; ui/mod.rs registers no queue module (the two new modules on this branch are `skip_pill` and `up_next`, mod.rs:27/35); icons.rs:13-31 has no list/queue/ellipsis mask; no `/tmp/nativejelly-*` trigger touches a queue (full catalog grepped — 40 triggers, none queue-related). The only queue-derived UI is up_next.rs, which only owns the control row when `slot_for` resolves `ControlSlot::UpNext` (player_

- **The queue's item rows are received and then thrown away — nothing retains the list** — `blocker` / `small`
  `create_play_queue` gets the whole `Metadata[]` window back from PMS (every row a full item with thumb, S/E, duration, viewOffset, codecs and Part key — docs/pms-api.md §Up Next confirms it verified live), then keeps ONLY the single successor and drops the rest on the floor. `PlayQueueResult` has no `items` field. So a queue overlay currently has no data to draw, even though the round trip that would fetch it already happens on every play.
  *Where:* `plex/timeline.rs:51-92` (add a projected `items: Vec<QueueRow>` to `PlayQueueResult`), `route.rs:381-387` (`QueueInfo`) → `route.rs:493-513` (`Plan`) → `route.rs:828-863` (`apply_plan`, the only main-thread writer). No new endpoint. NB `plex/models.rs:38-44` documents that `Metadata[]` may be a WINDOW of the queue — a long show may need `X-Plex-Container-Start/Size` on a follow-up `GET /playQueues/{id}`.
  *Device:* Memory shape, not the player. `plex/timeline.rs:72-79` explicitly pulls the successor OUT rather than cloning it "because a `Metadata` row carries the whole Media/Part/Stream/Role tree and this runs on the resolve worker on a 32-bit TV" — keeping 20+ of those wholesale contradicts that reasoning. Project each row down to a lean struct (rk, playQueueItemID, titles, season/index, thumb, dur_ms, view_offset, part key, codecs) on the worker, exactly as `up_next_of` already does at `route.rs:403-421`. The install must land through `apply_plan` on the MAIN thread — the resolve worker is deliberately read- and write-pure w.r.t. route statics (`route.rs:462-522`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED but MORE PARTIAL than stated, in a way that lowers the effort further. `PlayQueueResult` (timeline.rs:157-165) carries `id`, `selected_item_id`, `remaining`, `next` — no `items`; `next_after` (timeline.rs:80-92) `drain`s away everything after the successor and `mc` dies with the fn (timeline.rs:61-68). BUT the exact mechanism the finding prescribes already exists in miniature for ONE row: `up_next_of` projects a full `Metadata` down to the lean 11-field `UpNext` on the worker (route.rs:403-421), it travels in `QueueInfo` (route.rs:381-387) → `Plan::up_next` (route.rs:512) → and is in

- **A brand-new PlayQueue is created for every item, including each auto-advance — the queue is never advanced in place** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex's model is ONE PlayQueue whose `playQueueSelectedItemID` moves as playback advances. We POST a fresh `/playQueues` for each item: playing episode 10 creates queue A, auto-advancing to episode 11 creates queue B. Consequences: an extra POST per episode; `/status/sessions` and any remote-control client see the queue identity change mid-binge; and any user-built or reordered queue could never survive a single advance — which makes this the prerequisite for every other queue capability below.
  *Where:* `route.rs:428-460` (`resolve_playqueue` needs a "queue already exists, advance it" branch) and `plex/timeline.rs` (add `advance_play_queue(queue_id, item_id)` → `PUT /playQueues/{id}?…` and/or reuse the existing queue id when the successor comes from it). `docs/pms-api.md` documents none of the PlayQueue mutation endpoints — §7 stops at `/:/timeline`.
  *Device:* None from the player engine — this is pure PMS REST on the resolve worker, and `http_open` already accepts any method (`stream.rs:204-205`). The one real constraint is threading: `PQ_ID`/`PQ_ITEM_ID` are `static mut` written only by `apply_plan` on the main thread (`route.rs:850-851`), and `ResolveEnv` exists precisely because a worker reading those Strings while the main thread reassigns them is a use-after-free (`route.rs:462-487`). Any queue-advance state must travel worker→main in `Plan`, never be written from the worker.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED exactly as described. `build_stream` calls `resolve_playqueue(rk, &session, &env.machine_id)` for every non-empty rk (route.rs:539-545); `resolve_playqueue` unconditionally calls `create_play_queue`, i.e. `POST /playQueues?...&continuous=1` (route.rs:439, timeline.rs:51-60). Both play entry points funnel into the same `request_play` (route.rs:738) — `request_play_movie` (781) and `request_play_up_next` (798) — and `play_up_next` (app.rs:824-845) routes the successor through the latter, so an auto-advance chain POSTs a new queue per episode. Grepped the whole tree: `PUT /playQueues` a

- **Playback cannot jump to an arbitrary queue member — only to the immediate successor** — `major` / `medium`
  Selecting any row in Plex HTPC's queue starts that item. Our only queue-driven transition is `play_up_next`, which can start exactly one thing: `route::up_next()`, the single stored successor. There is no API to start the 5th item, and no previous-item path at all (you cannot go back to the episode you just finished from inside the player).
  *Where:* Generalise `route::request_play_up_next` (`route.rs:790-802`) into `request_play_queue_item(row)` over the retained rows from gap #2, and reuse `app.rs:824-845`'s stop-then-start ritual verbatim. Optionally `PUT /playQueues/{id}?playQueueSelectedItemID=…` so the server's queue cursor follows.
  *Device:* Moderate and specific to this device — but the hazard is already documented and solved once. `app.rs:817-823` warns that `start_bufferfeed` NO-OPS while an Engine is live, so the outgoing session must be stopped first, and the stop must precede `request_play_*` because teardown reads the outgoing session ids and clears the URL that the new plan is about to overwrite. Every Starfish/ACB reload also has to stay on the main thread (`crate::task::MainThread` is `!Send` by design — `app.rs`/`task.rs`). Any new jump path that hand-rolls the sequence instead of reusing `play_up_next`'s will produce a silent failure to advance, not an error.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with one correction that reduces effort. There is exactly one queue-driven transition: `up_next::take()` → `route::up_next().cloned()` (up_next.rs:98-101) over the single `static mut UP_NEXT` (route.rs:391-399), consumed only by `play_up_next` (app.rs:824-845). No previous-item path exists anywhere. CORRECTION: `route::request_play(rk, part, vcodec, acodec, title, ctx)` at route.rs:738 is ALREADY the generic 'play any item' entry — `request_play_movie` (781) and `request_play_up_next` (798) are both thin wrappers over it, and `play_item_now` (app.rs:849) starts an arbitrary catalog

- **No reorder / move control, and no PlayQueue move call** — `major` / `large`
  The reference's focused row slides in a double-chevron MOVE control that re-orders the queue. We have no reorder UI, no drag/move interaction model anywhere in the codebase, and no `PUT /playQueues/{id}/items/{playQueueItemID}/move?after=…` client call.
  *Where:* `plex/timeline.rs` (new `move_queue_item`), `ui/table.rs:35-61` (a trailing action-slot on `Row`, plus a reorder mode in `TableView`), and the new queue panel's key arm in `app.rs`.
  *Device:* None from the device: it is one PMS request (`http_open` takes any method, `stream.rs:204-205`) plus list animation the `TableView` springs already support (`ui/table.rs:97-102,219-240`). The only device note is that the request must not run on the SDL loop — every blocking PMS call in this codebase now goes through `task::spawn_small` (`route.rs:760`, `route.rs:179`) because a raw-socket round trip parks the frame loop for up to ~17 s on a stalled server (`route.rs:150-155`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. The only `/playQueues` request in the app is the POST at timeline.rs:51-60; there is no move/reorder call and no drag or row-swap interaction model anywhere. `Row` is `{ label, detail, badges, checked, ticon, dim }` (table.rs:35-44) with a single trailing icon slot and no per-row action affordance; `TableView` animates only the highlight pill and scroll (table.rs:99-102, 219-240), never row positions. icons.rs:13-31 has `ChevronUp`/`ChevronDown` as separate masks (they are per-asset directions, not rotations — icons.rs:16-19) but no paired move glyph. Severity major/large is right f

- **The shared list component cannot express a queue row: no thumbnail, no right-aligned duration, no progress bar, no play badge** — `major` / `medium`
  A reference queue row is [16:9 thumb with watched/progress overlay] + [bold title] + [dim "Show - S1 • E10 - Title"] + [right-aligned "1 hr 6 min"], with an amber play badge on the currently-playing row. `TableView::Row` supports a LEADING checkmark, a two-line label/detail stack, inline badge chips and ONE trailing icon — no leading art, no trailing text, no per-row overlay. Every existing thumbnail list in the app (detail episodes, chapters strip) is HORIZONTAL, so there is no vertical art-row component to reuse either.
  *Where:* `ui/table.rs:35-61` — add an optional leading `Art` slot with a taller row class, a trailing text accessory, and a per-row progress fraction; reuse `widgets::draw_card` + `card_row::resume_bar` rather than forking (`ui/CLAUDE.md` rule 4). Per `ui/CLAUDE.md`, a new row height is a component change, not a magic constant in the panel.
  *Device:* Fill-rate and texture churn on Mali, both already characterised. Each row thumb is a `/photo/:/transcode` fetch resolved async through the poster cache (`ui/widgets.rs:14-23`) — same path the home shelves use at 60 fps — and `TableView` already scissor-clips so only ~6 rows rasterize. Two known traps apply: 1:1-texel content must snap its origin (`gfx::snap`) but SCALED art must NOT (`docs/agent-reference.md` rasterization contract), and NPOT textures went black on this Mali once (see the capture-stream memory). Gate on `tests/run.py --fps-player`.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED for `TableView` itself — `Row { label, detail, badges, checked, ticon, dim }` (table.rs:35-44), heights fixed at ROW_H 60 / ROW_H_TALL 92 with a 32px leading CHECK column (table.rs:76-88), and `accessory` is a Section-header field (table.rs:65), not a row one. THREE CORRECTIONS to the 'nothing exists' framing: (a) `Badge::Text(String)` (table.rs:21) already lets a row carry arbitrary text as a chip, but it is drawn INLINE after the label (table.rs:351-355), not right-aligned; (b) the amber resume bar is NOT poster-only — `card_row::draw_tile`/`draw_focused` take an `Art` plus `resume

- **Up Next only fires on a CREDITS marker; without one the episode ends and the next one starts instantly, with no tile, no countdown and no way to cancel** — `major` / `small`
  `slot_for` only yields `UpNext` when a marker is under the playhead AND it is `Credits`. Many items carry no markers (docs/pms-api.md: of the episodes probed there, two carry credits only; movies generally carry none, and marker coverage is uneven). For a marker-less episode the user gets no Up Next tile at all — and at EOS `finish_playback` calls `play_up_next` immediately, cutting to the next episode with zero interstitial and zero opportunity to stop it. The reference client always presents the queue/Up Next affordance near the end.
  *Where:* `ui/player_hud.rs:252-264` (`slot_for` — add a time-remaining trigger when there is no credits marker, e.g. last N seconds of `duration_ns`) and/or `app.rs:758-773` (`finish_playback` — arm the countdown instead of jumping). The duration is already live in `crate::player::duration_ns()`/`playpos_ns()`.
  *Device:* One device-specific hazard: an end-of-item trigger derived from the playhead is fragile here. `docs/pms-api.md` §markers records that a `final` marker's `endTimeOffset` equals the CONTAINER duration, which the decoder's playhead routinely stops short of — "treat it as open-ended or an end-of-item prompt blinks out over the last frames". A `duration − N s` threshold must be one-way-latching for the same reason, and must tolerate `playpos_ns` being written by LG's media thread between the input handlers and the draw (`ui/player_hud.rs:266-269`). Reachable headlessly via `/tmp/nativejelly-marker=credits` only for items that HAVE the marker — the no-marker case needs `/tmp/nativejelly-autoseek` near the end.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `slot_for(None, has_next)` returns `Discs` regardless of `has_next` (player_hud.rs:252-264), asserted by the test at player_hud.rs:505; the input is `metadata::active_marker()` (player_hud.rs:271), which is markers-only with no duration fallback (metadata.rs:172-179) and gated on `is_playing`. At EOS `app.rs:2089-2092` calls `finish_playback` → `play_up_next` immediately (app.rs:761-773, 824-845) with no interstitial. PARTIAL, and it matters: the countdown machinery is fully built and only unreachable without a credits marker — 10s deadline, arm/cancel/latch/reset (up_next.rs:28-110

- **No add-to-queue / "Play Next", and no per-item "…" context menu anywhere in the app** — `minor` / `medium`
  Plex clients let you add an item to the queue or play it next, and the reference's focused queue row exposes a "…" per-item menu (which is also where remove-from-queue lives). We have neither: no queue-mutating action exists on the detail page, the home shelves, the library grid, or in the player. The long-press primitive that would host a context menu is implemented but never consumed.
  *Where:* `plex/timeline.rs` (`POST /playQueues/{id}?uri=…&next=1` for Play Next; `DELETE /playQueues/{id}/items/{itemID}` for remove — the latter needs a two-line `http_delete` beside `stream.rs:529`), a context-menu popover on `ui/popover.rs`+`ui/table.rs`, and call sites in `ui/detail.rs` / the new queue panel.
  *Device:* None known. Adding `http_delete` costs nothing — `http_open` already takes the method as a `&str` (`stream.rs:204-205`) and `http_put` (`stream.rs:529-551`) is the template. Same off-the-loop rule as above.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED on every point. `press::is_long` is defined at press.rs:144 and referenced only by its own module doc (press.rs:5) and ui/CLAUDE.md:62 — zero call sites in the whole tree. detail.rs:88 is still `const NBTN: c_int = 2` on this branch (Play + watched toggle; the uncommitted detail.rs work is `pump_reveal`/`open_show_at_episode`, nothing action-related). info_panel.rs:48-50 is exactly `["From Beginning", "Go to Show"/"Go to Movie"]`. stream.rs wraps only GET (507), PUT (533) and POST (556); no DELETE — but `http_open` already takes the method as a `&str` (stream.rs:204-205), so adding o

- **The queue's item COUNT is computed and then only written to the log — no "20 Videos" header, no show-title header** — `minor` / `small`
  The reference's queue header is the show title over an item count. We compute `remaining` from `playQueueTotalCount − playQueueSelectedItemOffset − 1`, log it, and never surface it. Nothing in the UI ever tells the user how many episodes are queued behind the one playing.
  *Where:* `route.rs:381-387` + `route.rs:493-513` to carry the count into `Plan`, then the queue panel's header. The show title is already available from `metadata::now_playing()` (`metadata.rs:255-269`) and from `UpNext::show_title` (`route.rs:370`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and one field-forward from being fixed. `remaining = (play_queue_total_count - play_queue_selected_item_offset - 1).max(0)` at timeline.rs:65, retained on `PlayQueueResult` at timeline.rs:161 — but its ONLY reader is the log line at route.rs:442-447; `QueueInfo` (route.rs:381-387) and `Plan` (route.rs:493-513) both drop it, so it never reaches the main thread. Grepped `remaining` across rust-modules/src: only route.rs:443-444 and timeline.rs:46/65/68/161 in this sense. The show title is indeed already available two ways (`metadata::now_playing()` and `UpNext::show_title`, route.rs:3

- **The queue is never re-fetched — no `GET /playQueues/{id}`, so watched/resume state and any server-side change are invisible** — `minor` / `medium`
  The queue snapshot is taken once, at play start. Over a 50-minute episode the user's watched state and viewOffsets change (our own timeline reporter writes them every 10 s), other clients can add to the queue, and the returned `Metadata[]` may be only a WINDOW of a long queue — none of which we would ever see. The reference client's list reflects live state (checkmarks, amber progress bars) and scrolls the whole queue.
  *Where:* `plex/timeline.rs` (`fetch_play_queue(id, start, size)` → `GET /playQueues/{id}?X-Plex-Container-Start/Size`), driven from the queue panel's open path through the existing async mailbox idiom (`metadata.rs:724-770`'s generation + single-flight + per-frame pump).
  *Device:* The fetch itself is safe — a multi-item queue body already parses today through `post_json` (`plex/timeline.rs:61`), and chunked responses ARE decoded (`stream.rs:368-421`), so `docs/agent-reference.md`'s "no chunked decoding" caveat does not bite. The real device constraint is that it must NOT be a blocking call on the SDL loop: `metadata::load_detail_now` is named `_now` precisely to flag "this one is a deliberate freeze" (`metadata.rs:665`), and the whole async audit exists because blocking PMS calls parked the frame loop for seconds (`route.rs:150-159`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `impl Client` in timeline.rs has exactly three methods — `timeline` (15), `machine_identity` (34), `create_play_queue` (51) — and no queue read. models.rs:38-41 documents that the returned `Metadata[]` may be a window while timeline.rs:65 derives `remaining` from the counters and never pages. The device note is right that this must not block the loop: `route.rs`'s whole async shape (`spawn_small` at route.rs:760, the generation/mailbox `pump_play` at 813-823) is the idiom to copy, and metadata.rs's mailboxes are the closest template. Only meaningful once #1/#2 exist, hence minor.

- **No previous-/next-item transport control and no remote binding for skip-forward/skip-back through the queue** — `minor` / `medium`
  Beyond auto-advance there is no way to move through the queue from the transport. The control row holds only the Subtitles + Audio discs (or a stand-in), and the remote's transport wcodes bound are PAUSE / PLAY / STOP only — no next-track/prev-track.
  *Where:* `ui/consts.rs:47-51` (add the wcodes once observed in the event log), `app.rs:1482-1512` (key arm), and either the control row (`ui/player_hud.rs:385-392`) or the queue panel. Depends on gap #4 for the "previous" direction.
  *Device:* The wcodes must be MEASURED, not guessed: LG's SDL fork has a shifted `SDL_KeyboardEvent` and the app reads the webOS keycode at raw byte offset +20 (`docs/agent-reference.md`); `ui/consts.rs:43-44` already warns to "verify the raw wcodes in the event log on a new remote". This Magic Remote may not emit next/prev at all. Beyond that it is gap #4's device risk (the stop-then-start engine ritual).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `ControlSlot` is `Discs` (2 items) | `Skip` | `UpNext` (1 each) — player_hud.rs:200-219 — and `draw_hud` draws exactly those three (player_hud.rs:385-392). consts.rs:47-51 defines only `WCODE_PAUSE 72` / `WCODE_STOP 413` / `WCODE_PLAY 450` (plus CH_UP/CH_DOWN 33/34 for the library grid); app.rs:1482-1512 handles PAUSE/PLAY/STOP and nothing else in that family. The device caution is well-founded and already written down in the file the fix would touch (consts.rs:43-44 'verify the raw wcodes in the event log on a new remote'). Depends on #4 for the previous direction.

- **Queue shuffle and repeat are hard-coded off with no way to change them** — `minor` / `small`
  `create_play_queue` sends `shuffle=0&repeat=0` as literals. Plex players expose both for a queue (repeat-one/repeat-all matters for binge play), and shuffle=1 is what a "Shuffle" entry point on a show page would need. Neither is reachable.
  *Where:* `plex/timeline.rs:51-69` (take a queue-options struct, in the `plex/params.rs` style used by `TimelineReport`/`StreamSelection`), a toggle in the queue panel, and optionally a Shuffle action on `ui/detail.rs`'s button row (`ui/detail.rs:88`, currently `NBTN = 2`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim: `.int("continuous", 1).int("shuffle", 0).int("repeat", 0)` at timeline.rs:56-58, and `create_play_queue(&self, machine_id, rating_key, session)` (timeline.rs:51) exposes no way to vary them; its single caller passes nothing (route.rs:439). Grepped `shuffle`/`repeat` across rust-modules/src: those two lines only. The suggested `plex/params.rs` options-struct style is the right shape — `TimelineReport` (params.rs:58-68) and `StreamSelection` are the precedents. minor/small confirmed; note repeat is also inert until #3 makes a queue outlive one item.

- **Non-episode items never get an Up Next, so a movie's queue is invisible even as a one-row list** — `minor` / `small`
  `up_next_of` returns `None` for anything whose `kind` is not "episode". That is correct for the one-item tile (a movie's `continuous=1` queue is verified to be just itself), but it means the queue concept is episode-only in our model: a queue overlay reusing `UpNext` would show nothing for a movie, whereas the reference shows the queue whatever the type — and a movie queue becomes non-trivial the moment add-to-queue (gap #6) exists.
  *Where:* `route.rs:401-421` — the row projection for the LIST (gap #2) must not inherit the episode-only gate; keep the gate on the one-item control (`ui/player_hud.rs:252-264`) where it is correct.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED: `up_next_of` bails on `m.kind != "episode"` (route.rs:403-406), with the doc line justifying it for the one-item tile, and the behaviour is pinned by the host test at timeline.rs:118-120 ('a queue of one — the season finale / movie case') plus the live note in docs/pms-api.md:227-228. The gate is correct where it is; the finding's point — that the LIST projection must not inherit it — stands and is a real design constraint on gap #2, not a bug today. minor/small confirmed; it is effectively a sub-clause of #2 and #6 rather than independent work.

- **The PlayQueue mutation endpoints are undocumented in the verified PMS reference, and nothing in the on-device suite exercises the queue chain** — `minor` / `small`
  `docs/pms-api.md` is the authoritative spec the data layer is built from, and it documents only the queue CREATE (§Up Next) plus the timeline params — no `GET /playQueues/{id}`, no move, no remove, no add, no selected-item advance. Separately, none of the 25 on-device cases covers Up Next, auto-advance or any queue behaviour, so the entire chain (credits marker → tile → countdown → stop → next episode) has never been graded by the harness.
  *Where:* `docs/pms-api.md` (a §7b PlayQueue section, verified live before any of the above is written — the file's contract is "verified"), and `tests/manifest.json` + `tests/run.py` for an auto-advance case.
  *Device:* The test case is device-cheap because the hook already exists: `/tmp/nativejelly-marker=credits` seeks to 5 s before the server's credits marker specifically so "the whole finish → Up Next → auto-advance chain" is reachable in seconds instead of 50 minutes (`docs/agent-reference.md`; implemented at `app.rs:2051-2082`). Two harness rules bite: the case's start position is server state and must be reset via `/:/unscrobble` (a `PUT /:/progress?time=0` returns 200 and changes nothing), and an auto-advance case ends on a SECOND item, so its assertions must not assume one ratingKey.
  *Verified:* HALF-REFUTED — the second clause is flatly wrong on this working tree, and it is the half that carried the effort. The suite DOES exercise the whole chain: `marker_credits_up_next` in tests/manifest.json plays the `episode_hevc_4k_hdr10_eac3` item and asserts `expect_up_next: episode_hevc_4k_hdr10_eac3_next` (covers `markers`/`credits-final`/`playqueue-continuous`/`up-next`/`auto-advance`, run_secs 110, `setup.also_reset` naming the successor so its viewOffset is unscrobbled too — both item keys resolve through the gitignored tests/manifest.local.json), and `marker_intro_offer` is the intro half. tests/run.py adds the `marker` trigger emitter (+`nativejelly-marker`), the `op_marker_offer` grader

- **The Up Next tile carries no duration and no resume/watched state for the queued item** — `polish` / `small`
  Reference queue rows show a right-aligned duration and mark partially-watched items with an amber bar. Our tile shows only "Up Next · S1, E10 · Title" over the still. The data is already in hand — `UpNext` carries `dur_ms` and `resume_ms`, and `play_up_next` USES `resume_ms` to resume the episode — so the user is silently dropped mid-episode with no prior indication.
  *Where:* `ui/up_next.rs:157-194` (caption + a `card_row::resume_bar` call on the still), formatting through the shared `ui/fmt.rs` (`dur_short`/`time_left`) rather than inline.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `UpNext` carries `dur_ms`/`resume_ms` (route.rs:375-376), `play_up_next` consumes `resume_ms` via `metadata::resume_ns` (app.rs:834) — and the tile's caption is built from `season`/`index`/`ep_title` only (up_next.rs:171-182). The still is drawn by `draw_card` (up_next.rs:165), whose signature (widgets.rs:88) has no resume parameter. Two mechanical notes for whoever fixes it: `card_row::resume_bar` is private (card_row.rs:313) so it must be promoted, and the shared formatters `dur_short`/`time_left` already exist (fmt.rs:6, 29) so nothing needs inlining. polish/small confirmed.

- **Watched items get no checkmark badge on the thumb (our progress language is the inverse and does not cover "watched")** — `polish` / `small`
  The reference queue puts a checkmark badge on watched thumbnails. **Our card language now does too** — as of 2026-08-13 a watched poster wears a white tick over a corner veil and an unstarted one wears nothing (this entry was written when the polarity was the other way round and read "there is deliberately no watched marker"). What is still true is the SHAPE limit: the mark lives only on the poster branch of the card composite, not on the 16:9 `Thumb` branch a queue row would use.
  *Where:* `ui/widgets.rs:38-75` (`card`) — extend the `Art::Thumb` branch with the same overlay vocabulary, or add a watched variant, so the queue panel and any future 16:9 list inherit it. This is a deliberate design decision, not an oversight: `ui/CLAUDE.md`/`ui/widgets.rs:48-51` call the amber angle "the ONE progress language on every poster".
  *Device:* None known — icon masks are rasterized once per (icon, size) and cached (`ui/icons.rs:51-53`), and the angle mask is already quantized to 4px specifically to bound Mali texture uploads during the focus pop (`ui/widgets.rs:54-56`).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED that no watched marker is composited onto art anywhere: `Icon::Check` (icons.rs:16) is used only as TableView's leading check (table.rs:300-305). CORRECTION to the rationale: it is NOT true that 'both marks live only on the poster branch'. Only the unwatched ANGLE is Poster-gated (widgets.rs:52-64, `m.unwatched && m.resume_ms == 0`) — the resume bar lives in `card_row`, drawn over whatever `rect` the caller passed regardless of `Art` variant (card_row.rs:204-214, 236-238), so an `Art::Thumb` row can already carry the amber bar today; it simply has no caller (every current `Art::Thumb

#### The in-player Settings tree

*Already implemented here: 13 reference features.*

- **There is no in-player Settings screen at all** — `blocker` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC's whole two-pane "Settings" modal (Playback Options / Video Quality / Video / Audio / Subtitles / the three direct-play checkboxes / Playback Speed) has no counterpart here. The player's overlay set is exactly None|Menu|Info|Chapters, the control row holds exactly Subtitles + Audio discs, and the bottom tab row holds exactly Info + Chapters — so there is no entry point a Settings screen could hang off, and every setting below is unreachable rather than merely unimplemented.
  *Where:* New ui/player_settings.rs composed from ui/popover.rs + ui/table.rs; a new `Overlay::Settings` arm in app.rs:578-584 with key/click arms beside the Menu arm (app.rs:1216-1233, app.rs:1655-1677); an entry point either as a third bottom TabPill in ui/player_hud.rs:467-485 or a third control-row disc. No PMS endpoint needed for the container itself.
  *Device:* none known — it is a modal drawn on the GLES plane exactly like the track menu, which already draws over the video plane with a scrim. The only device note is fill cost: the scrim is a full-screen quad and this Mali is fill-bound (see the ui-fillrate work), so a two-pane panel should reuse the track menu's single-scrim+panel construction rather than stacking translucent layers.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. `enum Overlay { None, Menu, Info, Chapters }` app.rs:579-584; `enum Modal` app.rs:601-607; tabs are `["Info"]` / `["Info","Chapters"]` at ui/player_hud.rs:468-472; ui/account_menu.rs:44-51 offers only Change profile / Sign out / Sign in. No settings module, route, widget or trigger anywhere (grep -i settings hits only doc comments at ui/table.rs:1,8 and ui/track_menu.rs:2-3). TWO CORRECTIONS to the evidence, both from uncommitted work on this branch. (1) The control row is NO LONGER 'exactly Subtitles + Audio discs': ui/player_hud.rs:200-266 introduces `ControlSlot::{Discs, S

- **~~No Video Quality picker — the transcode ladder is one hard-coded rung~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-24**
  The in-player overflow exposes Auto, Original and fixed bitrate/resolution choices built from the route's available ladder. Picks persist, apply immediately through the transactional reload path, remain available on a playback-error screen, and survive seeks without reverting to the bootstrap ceiling.
  *Historical proposal:* parameterise `TranscodeSpec`, persist the selection and route mid-play changes through a fresh Load; that is the shape which landed.
  *Device:* Moderate. Applying a quality change mid-playback must go through the existing reload path (route::retranscode -> player::reload_transcode, player/pump.rs:71-81), because a live transcode has no byte Cues and this pipeline needs a fresh Load when the stream content changes — an in-place flush leaves a stale GStreamer segment (documented at player/pump.rs:133-147). Choosing a LOWER rung is safe; the danger is the opposite direction: any rung must stay inside what the Load payload declares (H264/H265 only — route.rs:571-576) and the 4K/60 ceiling baked into PAYLOAD_H265 (player/engine.rs:31).
  *Historical audit evidence:* the cited fixed-query implementation predates `Ceiling`, `route::Quality` and `ui::more_menu`; it is not a claim about the current tree.

- **Direct Play policy implemented by #217; independent Direct Stream toggle remains absent.** Settings offers Auto, Forced and Disabled. Force overrides quality, requires acknowledgement, retains software feed limits, and has no automatic fallback. See [Playback settings](playback-settings.md).

- **No Playback Speed control (0.5x - 2x)** — `major` / `large`
  The reference client's "Playback Speed" row cycles Normal / 0.5x / 1.25x / 1.5x / 2x and persists. We have no rate concept anywhere: no UI row, no engine field, and no binding for a rate verb in the Starfish seam. The transport is pause / resume / seek only.
  *Where:* A new mangled-symbol binding in src/starfish.c beside SMP_Play/SMP_Pause (starfish.c:44-49) plus a wrapper in player/ffi.rs; a rate field on the Engine (player/engine.rs) that the feed pacing honours (player/engine.rs feed_stream / the PRIME/feed-ahead throttle at engine.rs:829-901); a Settings row.
  *Device:* Highest risk item in this area, and possibly impossible. (1) The symbol is unproven — the stub-.so link makes every link succeed whether or not the symbol exists on the device, so it has to be proven against the TV's own libplayerAPIs first (this is exactly the bind-tv-lib-abi case). (2) Even if present, we run BUFFERSTREAM buffer-feed with `"transmission":{"contentsType":"LIVE"}` and `lowDelayMode` (player/engine.rs:22-31); trick-play rate on a LIVE buffer-feed pipeline with an app-owned ACB sink is not a path Kodi/ss4s exercise. (3) The fallback — re-timestamping AUs in our own feed — is not viable: pts_shift/rebase is already load-bearing for seeks (player/pump.rs:161-200), audio is passed through compressed to the pipeline, and we have no way to pitch-correct it.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent, and the seam analysis is exactly right. player/ffi.rs:19-45 declares 13 sf_* verbs (load/ready/is_load_completed/play/pause/flush/push_eos/set_time_to_decode/set_content_info/send_segment/feed/unload/destroy) + 7 acb_* (create/bind/send_video_data/start/unload/pause/resume) — no rate verb; src/starfish.c:38-68 lists every mangled StarfishMediaAPIs/CustomPipeline symbol bound and `setPlayRate` is not among them; grep for playbackspeed|play_rate|setPlayRate|speed over rust-modules/src and src/*.c returns nothing. The device_risk is if anything understated: BUFFERSTREAM + `conte

- **~~No Playback Information / stats overlay~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31**
  The shared `app::diagnostics` Diagnostics overlay reports delivery mode, requested and observed quality, source/output picture and codecs, fps, progress, buffer, feed and Auto controller evidence. It is intentionally the same panel on local Direct, Original/remux and HLS so screenshots are comparable.
  *Historical proposal:* a stats view over player/route/shared state; the landed implementation is `app/diagnostics.rs` and the shared field-list widget.
  *Device:* None known, with one caveat worth designing around: the in-app capture stream cannot see the video plane (capture.rs is UI-plane only), so an on-screen stats overlay is actually the only channel that can correlate UI state with what the panel is showing — which argues for building it. Cost is a few text draws per frame; keep it off the per-frame CString path (use the memo pattern in player_hud.rs:171-192) so it does not cost fill/measure on the A53.
  *Historical audit evidence:* the cited absence predates `app::diagnostics`; fields the platform cannot measure (for example a hardware decoder's own dropped-frame counter) remain explicitly unknown rather than fabricated.

- **No subtitle appearance settings (size, position, colour, background)** — `major` / `small`
  The reference client's Subtitles submenu carries size / position / colour / background. Every one of ours is a compile-time constant: size 36, line height 48, pure white, a 4-offset black outline instead of a background box, a fixed baseline that only knows two states (HUD up / HUD down), and a wrap fixed at 42 characters and 3 lines maximum.
  *Partly landed 2026-09-17:* the caption's TONE is now a viewer preference — a **Color** section under the tracks in the player's Subtitles menu (`ui::track_menu`), white plus a five-rung gray ladder (`plex::session::SubtitleTone`, inks in `theme::SUBTITLE_INKS`), persisted install-wide in the session preferences and applied to text cues as ink and to image cues as a tint. It exists for HDR, where graphics white is mapped uncomfortably bright. Size, position and background are still the constants described here, and a server-BURNED subtitle is pixels the tone cannot reach.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:62-102 (draw_subtitles) reading a prefs struct; the char-count `wrap` at ui/player_hud.rs:38-57 should be replaced by ui::text_view::TextView's pixel wrap before size becomes variable, or a larger size will overflow the 42-char assumption. The image-subtitle path (ui/player_hud.rs:109-139) composites at the PGS 1920x1080 canvas coords and can only honour a position offset, not a size.
  *Device:* None known — this is pure UI on the GLES plane. Two device-specific notes: the caption is one of exactly two documented carve-outs from the theme::size ladder (ui/player_hud.rs:22-25), so a size setting should be expressed as a small offset scale over that carve-out rather than a new raw literal; and a real background box is cheaper on this fill-bound Mali than the current 5x text draw per line.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent; every constant is where claimed, in the current working tree: ui/player_hud.rs:73 `wrap(seg, 42)`, :74 `lines.len() < 3`, :82 `let sz = 36`, :83 `let lh = 48.0`, :87 `baseline = if hud_up { SCR_H-300 } else { SCR_H-100 }`, :89 pure-white, :90 `theme::scrim_black(0.85)` drawn as 4 offset outline passes (:95-97) — so a line costs 5 text draws. `draw_subtitles(hud_up)` takes ONE bool and nothing else; no prefs are plumbed from any caller (app.rs:2438). The image path (ui/player_hud.rs:104-137) composites `bitmap_by_key`'s own (x,y,w,h) rect, so as stated it can honour a position

- **Playback preference persistence implemented.** Quality and Direct Play mode are saved on the television; account audio/subtitle preferences sync with Plex. Individual features listed elsewhere retain their own scope.

- **Preferred audio/subtitle settings implemented by #217/#222/#223.** The Settings page uses the full Plex account language catalog and writes the active profile. Explicit show settings precede account defaults, and PMS selections remain authoritative. The live preference-propagation measurement still requires a throwaway account.

- **No Repeat / Shuffle** — `minor` / `medium`
  The reference client's Playback Options pane holds Repeat (No Repeat / Repeat One / Repeat All) and a Shuffle checkbox. We create every PlayQueue with shuffle=0 and repeat=0 as literals and never update them, so an episode always plays straight through into the next one in queue order.
  *Where:* plex/timeline.rs:50-70 (parameterise create_play_queue) plus a new PUT /playQueues/{id}?repeat=&shuffle= method in the same file; route.rs:428-460 (resolve_playqueue) which owns the queue result; the Up Next descriptor at route.rs:403-421 comes off that same queue snapshot.
  *Device:* None known at the device level (it is one PMS call), but there is an architectural wrinkle worth recording: Up Next is derived ONCE from the queue created at play time (route.rs:439-459, timeline.rs next_after) and cached in a static (route.rs:391-399). Toggling repeat/shuffle mid-playback would leave a stale successor on screen unless the queue is re-fetched and UP_NEXT reinstalled on the main thread (route.rs:828-863 apply_plan is the only legal writer).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. plex/timeline.rs:53-59 builds POST /playQueues with literal `.int("continuous",1).int("shuffle",0).int("repeat",0)`; there is no PUT /playQueues/{id} anywhere and no UI concept (grep over plex/, route.rs, ui/). The architectural wrinkle is accurate and if anything sharper than described: the queue is consumed ONCE at resolve time (route.rs:428-460 `resolve_playqueue` → `QueueInfo.up_next`), installed into the `static mut UP_NEXT` only by `apply_plan` (route.rs:828-836, main thread), and `up_next()` (route.rs:397-399) hands the drawing code a `&'static` — so a mid-playback re-

- **No subtitle timing offset / sync adjustment (and no audio delay)** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex HTPC's Subtitles submenu includes an offset control for out-of-sync subtitle files. We match cues against the raw playhead with no offset term, and there is no audio-delay equivalent either.
  *Subtitle half landed (lands #243):* see the Timing section under "No subtitle timing (sync) offset" below. The audio-delay half is still open.
  *Where:* player/mod.rs (active_subtitle / active_bitmap_key — add an offset applied to the lookup, not to the stored cues, so a change is instant), the two call sites at ui/player_hud.rs:63 and :122, and a Settings row.
  *Device:* Cheap on the direct-play path (it is arithmetic in a per-frame lookup over a bounded cue store). IMPOSSIBLE on the transcode path: there the subtitles are burned into the video by the server (route.rs:22-24, plex/transcoder.rs:86-89), so the row must be hidden or disabled while route::is_transcoding() is true. Audio delay is likewise impossible client-side — see the audio-settings gap.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. player/mod.rs:235-245 `active_subtitle` matches `now_ns >= c.start_ns && now_ns < c.end_ns` with no offset term; player/mod.rs:283-293 `active_bitmap_key` is the same, as is `bitmap_by_key` (:296-303); the callers pass `player::playpos_ns()` straight in at ui/player_hud.rs:63 and :122. No audio-delay concept exists anywhere (no rate/clock/delay verb in player/ffi.rs:19-45). The transcode caveat is right — subtitles are burned server-side (transcoder.rs:86-89 subtitles=burn), so the row is hidden during an ordinary transcode, and shown disabled with a one-line reason instead of hidden during a live Plex Pass audio-enhancement Burn specifically (M7, `ui/track_menu.rs`'s `sub_style_locked`/`table_form`); note the same predicate already drives ui/tra

- **No audio settings (boost, normalisation, passthrough, downmix)** — `minor` / `large`
  The reference client's Audio submenu carries audio boost, normalisation and passthrough choices. We have none, and no volume control of any kind in the player.
  *Where:* Nothing local would host it. The only reachable lever is server-side: the transcode spec in plex/transcoder.rs:78-89 (e.g. request a 2-channel downmix) driven from route.rs:136-145.
  *Device:* Client-side boost/normalisation is architecturally impossible here: we pass compressed audio through to LG's pipeline and never hold PCM, and player/CLAUDE.md's ACB rules forbid feeding audio to ACB at all (SOUND_ERROR_019). Implementing it would mean decoding + re-encoding audio on a 32-bit ARM alongside the existing demux, which the thread and CPU budget does not have. Passthrough is likewise the pipeline's decision, not ours.
  **Update (issue #266, landed):** the "server-side downmix option only" framing undersold what the
  transcoder itself offers: PMS 1.43.4+'s Plex Pass DSP (`boostDialog`/`normalizeLoudness`) landed
  as two toggle rows in the player's Audio tab, gated Plex-Pass-only and invisible (not greyed) on
  every other server. Passthrough and downmix are still unclaimed — see `docs/pms-api.md`'s M1-M5
  for the measured wire facts.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent, and the 'architecturally impossible client-side' reasoning checks out: player/ffi.rs:19-45 has no volume/gain/passthrough verb, src/starfish.c:38-68 binds none, and the app never holds PCM (the demuxer emits compressed AC3/EAC3/AAC frames straight to sf_feed). TWO CORRECTIONS. (a) The citation `plex/transcoder.rs:46 audioCodec=ac3` is really inside the `profile_extra()` string at transcoder.rs:36-46 (line :44 `&container=matroska&videoCodec=hevc&audioCodec=ac3`) — it is a capability-profile transcode TARGET, not a query param; there is no audioCodec/audioChannels/maxAudioChan

- **No auto-play-next toggle or countdown control** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex clients let the user turn off automatic next-episode playback (and adjust or skip the countdown). **Update:** the toggle has landed as the Next episode preference (Settings > Playback: Up Next countdown, the default; After credits; Off, which leaves the player at the end of an episode like a film), so the claims below that auto-advance is unconditional describe the audited tree; the countdown length is still the compile-time value. *As audited:* ours was unconditional by design: the finish path always started the queued episode with no interstitial, and the Up Next countdown length is a compile-time value.
  *Where:* app.rs:761-773 and app.rs:2095-2100 gated on a persisted flag; ui/up_next.rs for the countdown duration.
  *Device:* None known — it is a branch on an existing flag, and the surrounding session bookkeeping (stop the outgoing engine before requesting the next plan, app.rs:824-845) is unaffected by skipping the advance.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent as a persisted setting. app.rs:761-773 `finish_playback` calls play_up_next first and only exits if nothing is queued, with the doc at :759-760 stating 'There is no interstitial'; the countdown fires from app.rs:2095-2100 (`up_next::expired`) with no user gate; the duration is a compile-time const `COUNTDOWN_MS: u32 = 10_000` at ui/up_next.rs:28. PARTIAL, and richer than the auditor states: a per-episode escape already exists and is properly latched — `up_next::cancel()` sets DEADLINE=0 AND a `CANCELLED` latch (ui/up_next.rs:34-36, :60-66) so `tick` cannot re-arm it, cleared o

- **No auto-skip intro/credits setting** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex offers automatic intro/credit skipping as a persisted preference. Ours is manual only: the Skip pill appears in the control row and the user must press it.
  *Where:* app.rs:2199-2230 (the offer edge is exactly where an auto-skip would fire activate_ctrl_row itself), reusing ui/skip_pill.rs's SkipAction and metadata::mark_skipped.
  *Device:* None known — an auto-skip is the same request_seek the button already issues, and the seek path (in-place av_seek with the stuck-watchdog at player/pump.rs:83-116) is unchanged. One behavioural care point recorded in app.rs:797-801: mark_skipped must run BEFORE the seek, because the seek lands on the preceding keyframe which is usually still inside the segment.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. ui/skip_pill.rs and the `ControlSlot::Skip` arm exist, `slot_for` (ui/player_hud.rs:250-266) resolves precedence, and app.rs:2199-2230 is the offer edge — it logs 'marker offer:', raises the HUD and moves focus to row 1 once per SEGMENT (keyed on `ctrl.offer()`, not the slot), but never activates. The mark_skipped-before-seek ordering note is right and is implemented at app.rs:797-801. PARTIAL: an automatic seek to a marker already exists as a test hook — `/tmp/nativejelly-marker[=intro|credits]` (app.rs:2051-2080) seeks to 5s BEFORE the marker so the pill is reachable; it is t

- **No version picker among multiple Media[] entries** — `minor` / `medium`
  Where a library item has several versions (4K + 1080p), Plex clients let the user choose which one plays; HTPC surfaces this next to Video Quality. We always take the first media entry and pin mediaIndex=0/partIndex=0 on every transcoder call, so a second version is invisible and unreachable.
  *Where:* plex/models.rs:192-196 (index-aware accessor), plex/transcoder.rs:75-76/:111-112 (carry the index on TranscodeSpec in plex/params.rs), route.rs:523-652 (build_stream takes the chosen media entry), and a Settings row listing the versions.
  *Device:* Low, but a chosen version can be a container or codec this pipeline cannot direct-play — the existing gates handle that by falling into the remux/transcode branch (route.rs:561-585), so the failure mode is a transcode rather than a black screen, provided the version choice flows through build_stream rather than around it.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. plex/models.rs:192-194 `first_part()` = `media.first().and_then(|m| m.part.first())`; transcoder.rs:71-72 and :107-108 both hard-code mediaIndex=0/partIndex=0; every app-level conversion flattens to Media[0] (metadata.rs:313, metadata.rs:579, pms.rs:134, route.rs:407, and the decision readers route.rs:271, :302). docs/pms-api.md:256-264 shows a real dual-version episode (4K HDR + 1080p) and :344 names videoResolution as the picker field. PARTIAL, in the data layer only: the wire DTO DOES keep the whole list — `pub media: Vec<Media>` at plex/models.rs:162-163 — so the extra ve

- **The shared table lacks the three row primitives a settings tree needs** — `minor` / `small`
  The reference rows are (a) label + right-aligned VALUE ("Video Quality  26.1 Mbps 4K (Original)", "Playback Speed  Normal"), (b) a CHECKBOX with a visible off state, and (c) a drill-in that shows its submenu live in a second pane. Our Row has none of these: a value can only be a left-aligned detail sub-line, `checked` renders a leading checkmark when true and simply nothing when false (no empty box), and TableView holds one flat list with no navigation stack — the Library's drill-in works by rebuilding the sections in place.
  *Where:* ui/table.rs (a `value: String` field drawn right-aligned before `ticon`; a `toggle: Option<bool>` using ui/icons.rs's Ring + Check pair, or a new checkbox asset in assets/icons/), and either a small level stack in ui/table.rs or a second TableView instance for the right pane in the new settings module.
  *Device:* None known — pure UI. Worth doing in ui/table.rs rather than in the settings screen, per the ui/CLAUDE.md rule to improve a component before forking one: the Library sort/filter menus and the account popover would all inherit the value column and the checkbox off-state, and the badge/elide reserve logic at table.rs:315-337 already has the layout hook a right-aligned value slots into.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent — and one piece of the auditor's evidence is wrong in a way that makes the gap BIGGER. `Row` (ui/table.rs:35-44) is label/detail/badges/checked/ticon/dim: no right-aligned value, `checked` draws a leading Check only when true (table.rs:301-305, no else — no empty box), `ticon` is the single trailing slot, and TableView is one flat list with no level stack. CORRECTION: `Section::accessory` (table.rs:65, builder :72) is DEAD — the header draw at table.rs:275-288 renders only `sec.header`; nothing anywhere sets it (grep: the only hits are the declaration, the builder and two doc

- **No two-pane Settings layout (left list + live submenu on the right)** — `minor` / `medium`
  The reference Settings modal shows the focused row's submenu live in a right pane, so "Playback Options" reveals Repeat/Shuffle/Playback Information without a commit. Every menu we have is a single narrow panel; drilling in REPLACES the list and BACK restores it.
  *Where:* The new settings module would hold two TableView statics and two panel rects, sharing one ui/popover.rs Popover; the right pane redraws from the left pane's focused index each frame (cheap — sections are rebuilt on focus change, exactly as ui/library.rs:521-545 rebuilds on state change).
  *Device:* None known beyond fill cost: two panels plus a scrim is more translucent area than the track menu draws, and this Mali is fill-bound (the ui-fillrate work). ui/table.rs::draw already scissor-clips to its frame (table.rs:251, released at :366) and that clip is global GL state, so two panels in one frame must set/clear per panel rather than nesting.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent. ui/track_menu.rs:328-342 `panel_rect` is ONE panel (560px audio / 448px subtitles, right-aligned at SCR_W-80) and :353-366 `draw` is one Popover scrim + one card + one `table().draw`; ui/library.rs:505-509 is one 470px panel with a replace-in-place drill (build_genre_menu library.rs:560-585). Nothing composes two tables. The GL-state warning is right and load-bearing: `TableView::draw` sets the scissor at table.rs:251 and clears it at :366 — global state, so two panels must set/clear per panel. ONE NUANCE: the track menu already has a two-LIST concept — LEFT/RIGHT switches th

- **No deinterlace / video-sync settings** — `polish` / `large`
  The reference client's Video submenu holds deinterlace and video-sync options. We expose neither, and cannot.
  *Where:* Would require new mangled-symbol bindings in src/starfish.c and the ff.rs/libavcodec side, if such controls are even exposed by libplayerAPIs on webOS 4.5.
  *Device:* Effectively impossible and also largely moot: decode, deinterlace and scaling all happen inside Starfish/ACB on the hardware video plane, which we only bind — we never touch a decoded frame (that is exactly why the in-app capture cannot see the video plane). Any attempt means proving new ABI against libplayerAPIs with the stub-.so trick masking absent symbols at link time.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED absent and correctly judged impossible. player/ffi.rs:19-45 is the entire control surface; src/starfish.c:38-68 lists every mangled symbol bound (Load/Feed/Play/Pause/Unload/flush/pushEOS/setTimeToDecode/notifyForeground/isLoadCompleted + sendSegmentEvent/loadSpi_getInfo/setContentInfo) — none touches scaling, field order or clock sync; grep deinterlace|videoSync returns nothing. One small addition supporting the verdict: `field_order` IS bound as an AVCodecParameters offset at ff.rs:91, and grep shows that field is never read anywhere — so even the SOURCE interlace flag is unused, l

#### Audio & subtitle track UX depth

*Already implemented here: 24 reference features.*

- **OK on the Subtitles/Audio disc does nothing — an empty `else if` arm makes the track menu unreachable from the remote** — `blocker` / `small`
  Plex HTPC opens the subtitle/audio picker from the transport row with one confirm press. In the current working tree the OK handler has TWO identical `else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {` arms; the first is EMPTY, so it swallows the case and the second (which opens the track menu) is dead code. With the Subtitles/Audio discs focused, OK does nothing at all — it doesn't open the picker and doesn't fall through to play/pause. The picker is only reachable by pointer click or the dev trigger, i.e. the entire audio/subtitle UX is unreachable with a Magic Remote in D-pad mode.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/app.rs:1409 (delete the empty arm). No PMS or player-engine call involved.
  *Device:* none known — pure input routing in the SDL key handler; nothing touches Starfish, ACB or the demuxer.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED verbatim in the working tree. rust-modules/src/app.rs:1405 `if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 && !ctrl.is_discs()`, :1409 `} else if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1 {` with an EMPTY body, :1410 the identical condition carrying `track_menu::open_tab(...)`. Because arm 1 excludes `ctrl.is_discs()`, the discs case (ControlSlot::Discs, the normal state — player_hud.rs:221 `is_discs`) falls into the empty arm at 1409 and is swallowed; line 1410-1412 is dead. `git diff rust-modules/src/app.rs` confirms this is uncommitted skip-pill/up-next work: the pre-diff code was one `if vis && hud_nav.focus == 1

- **Sidecar (external) subtitle streams are unreachable on the direct-play path — i.e. on almost every item** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC lists embedded AND sidecar subtitles together; a downloaded .srt beside the file just works. Here the menu filters external streams out unless the item is already transcoding, because the client renderer only sees streams inside the container the demuxer opened. Since this client is direct-play-first (MKV + H264/HEVC + AAC/AC3/EAC3 direct-play), the common case is a direct-played file whose only subtitles are sidecars — the user opens the picker and sees just "Off", or a list missing the language they have. There is no path to enable them at all: they can't be picked, so they can't even force the transcode that would burn them.
  *Landed 2026-09-18 for TEXT sidecars:* `player::sidecar` fetches the file once (`/library/streams/{id}?encoding=utf-8&format=srt`, falling back to encoding-only and then the bare key), parses SubRip/WebVTT into its own whole-file store (ASS/SSA now retains the complete script for native libass rendering, without the SubRip conversion) — `SHARED.sub_cues` is a 2 s / 512-cue window a backward seek would empty — and `ui::player_hud::draw_subtitles` asks it before the embedded store. The menu lists a renderable sidecar on direct play with an EXTERNAL badge, a server-selected one is restored on a direct-play start, and a failed fetch says so on screen. Device-confirmed with Hungarian `.srt` files on one set (on the v0.6.6 line). IMAGE sidecars (`.idx`/`.sub`, `.sup`) are still transcode-only, and there is still no subtitle delay control.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs:65-79 (stop filtering), a new sidecar fetch+parse feeding rust-modules/src/player/mod.rs:209 `push_subtitle_text`, and rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs (new `GET /library/streams/{id}` client method). PMS endpoint: /library/streams/{id} (the spec's /library/streams/{id}.{ext}).
  *Device:* Lower than the brief suggests: stream.rs DOES decode chunked transfer-encoding (rust-modules/src/stream.rs:116-160 `hs_next_chunk`, 368-370, 388-400), so the "no chunked decoding" line in the former root guide (now `docs/agent-reference.md`) is stale and a sidecar GET can use the existing numeric-IP raw-socket client on a worker thread. Real risks: (a) memory [[soft-subs-during-transcode]] records /library/streams/{id}.vtt returning 501 — request the raw sidecar form and verify on device first; (b) cue times must be pushed on the CONTENT-time ns axis the fed video PTS uses (player/mod.rs:204-232), which is easy for a whole-file sidecar but must survive the transcode's `disp_base` offset rebase; (c) nothing here goes near Starfish/ACB or the video plane.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, but MORE partial machinery exists than the auditor found. What already exists: (a) the filter is exactly rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs:68-79 `!s.external || crate::route::is_transcoding()` — so sidecars ARE listed, pickable and server-BURNED while transcoding (commit_subtitle_selection → route.rs:948 put_selection / request_transcode_refresh), i.e. the feature works on the transcode path and only the direct-play path is dark; (b) external is derived at metadata.rs:390-391 from `stream_type == 3 && !s.key.is_empty()`, and plex/models.rs:234-236 documents the delivery key as `/lib

- **No subtitle appearance settings — size, position, colour, background/shadow are all hard-coded** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC exposes subtitle size, position/vertical offset, text colour and background/shadow. Ours renders one fixed style: 36px, pure white, a 4-offset dark outline, bottom-centre at a fixed baseline, 48px line height. Nothing is user-adjustable and the Settings shell has no subtitle section. On the transcode/burn path the server-side size is likewise pinned at subtitleSize=100.
  *Partly landed 2026-09-17:* the caption's TONE is now a viewer preference — a **Color** section under the tracks in the player's Subtitles menu (`ui::track_menu`), white plus a five-rung gray ladder (`plex::session::SubtitleTone`, inks in `theme::SUBTITLE_INKS`), persisted install-wide in the session preferences and applied to text cues as ink and to image cues as a tint. It exists for HDR, where graphics white is mapped uncomfortably bright. Size, position and background are still the constants described here, and a server-BURNED subtitle is pixels the tone cannot reach.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:62-102 (parameterise), a new preference store beside rust-modules/src/plex/session.rs's on-disk save, plus a settings UI on the shared ui/table.rs TableView; the burn size rides plex/transcoder.rs:87.
  *Device:* None for the direct-play path — this is our own GLES text renderer and the values are already locals at player_hud.rs:82-89. The burned-in transcode path can only honour a size percentage (subtitleSize), never colour/position, so the two paths would диverge visually; that asymmetry is inherent to burn-on-server, not to this device.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED exactly as described. rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:82 `let sz = 36;` (self-described carve-out from theme::size), :83 `let lh = 48.0f32`, :87 `let baseline = if hud_up { SCR_H - 300.0 } else { SCR_H - 100.0 }`, :89 `let white = [1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]`, :90 outline `theme::scrim_black(0.85)` drawn at 4 fixed ±2px offsets (:94). Burn size pinned at rust-modules/src/plex/transcoder.rs:87 `.int("subtitleSize", 100)`. The current Settings screen has no subtitle controls and there is no general preference store in the crate. The single dynamic aspect is

- **No subtitle timing (sync) offset** — `major` / `small`
  Plex HTPC offers a +/- ms subtitle delay for out-of-sync sidecars, which is the standard fix for a mismatched .srt. There is no offset anywhere: cue lookup compares the raw playhead to the raw cue times, and there is no key binding, menu row or stored value for a delay.
  *Landed (lands #243):* a **Timing** section under Color in the player's Subtitles menu (`ui::track_menu`) — Earlier / Later in 100 ms steps and Reset, the offset as the section's read-out, up to 30 s late for any track and 30 s early for a sidecar; an embedded track takes a delay only, its Earlier row drawn dim at zero (`player::subtitle_offset_range_ms`, which the menu and the player's clamp both call) — held for one playback of one track: it is never persisted, and a new item or a different subtitle track starts at zero (a Retry of the same item, or a quality picked after a failure, keeps it with the subtitle it restores), because a timing error belongs to one track against one file. Every client-rendered lookup (embedded text, image sets, the sidecar) goes through `player::subtitle_clock_ns` (the playhead less the offset). Hidden on a transcode, where the server has already burned the captions. An embedded track's cues ride the same byte-bounded A/V queues as the picture (about 2 s ahead of the playhead at a high bitrate), so an advance would find nothing to draw; a sidecar is whole in memory. *Limits:* embedded text and image subtitles can lack the history needed for a delay after a seek. Embedded ASS retains known events across an in-place seek, so buffered delayed cues remain available. A full pipeline reload, including a native audio-track switch (`engine::switch_audio_native` → `reload_at`), discards embedded history and can leave a delayed track empty until enough history has been read again; a whole-file sidecar retains its history.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/player/mod.rs:234-245 and 281-293 (add a signed ns bias to both lookups), a control row in rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs, key handling in rust-modules/src/app.rs:1216-1233.
  *Device:* None for client-rendered subs — the bias is applied at cue lookup on the main thread; no Starfish/ACB involvement and no re-demux. Impossible for burned-in transcode subs (the server has already composited them into the video), so the control must be hidden or disabled while route::is_transcoding().
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/player/mod.rs `active_subtitle(now_ns)` matches `now_ns >= c.start_ns && now_ns < c.end_ns` with no bias term, and the image twin `active_bitmap_key(now_ns)` is identical. A crate-wide `rg -in 'sub_delay|subtitle_offset|sub_offset|sync_offset|subtitle_delay|sub_bias'` over rust-modules/src returns NOTHING. No key binding, no menu row (track_menu.rs `rebuild` builds exactly one Section per tab — build_audio/build_subs, no settings rows), no dev trigger (the full trigger catalog has 41 entries, none subtitle-timing related). Severity major/small is right; device_risk

- **Track choices are forgotten at every item boundary — nothing is remembered per show/series** — `major` / `medium`
  Plex HTPC remembers the audio/subtitle choice per series, so binge-watching in Japanese-audio/English-subs keeps working episode to episode. Here every new playback zeroes both stream ids and turns subtitles off, then re-runs the English-preference auto-pick. Auto-advancing to the next episode through Up Next goes through the same path, so the subtitle track the user just chose vanishes the moment the credits roll.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/route.rs:738-756 (consult a remembered choice keyed by grandparentRatingKey before resetting) + a small store beside rust-modules/src/metadata.rs's playing-item state; the pick would then flow through the existing route::commit_* / pick_dp_audio path.
  *Device:* none known — pure route/metadata state on the main thread. The only wrinkle is that the remembered subtitle must be re-resolved by language/stream identity on the NEW leaf (ids differ per episode), not by raw id.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/route.rs:745-746 `CUR_AUDIO_SID.write(0)` / `CUR_SUB_SID.write(0)` then `player::reset_audio_track()` + `player::reset_subtitle()` at the top of `request_play`; player/mod.rs `reset_subtitle` stores -1. `request_play_up_next` (route.rs:797-802) funnels straight into `request_play`, so the auto-advance chain inherits the wipe. No per-show map exists: `grandparent` appears only as display data (metadata.rs:204-205 show_title/show_rk, route.rs:370/413). TWO PARTIALS worth recording. (1) Within one item the choice IS sticky and deliberately so — player/mod.rs's `reset_s

- **The server's existing per-part stream selection is never read back — we write the selection but never honour one made elsewhere** — `major` / `small`
  Plex clients agree with each other because the part's selected audio/subtitle stream lives on the server. We PUT our picks (good) but ignore the server's: PMS marks the current pick with Stream.selected, and the field is parsed and then never used. Worse, on the direct-play path we never call put_selection at start either, so a subtitle a user turned on from Plex Web is silently ignored and playback opens with subs off and our own English auto-pick.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/metadata.rs:374-401 (carry `selected` onto metadata::Stream), rust-modules/src/route.rs:659-698 `pick_dp_audio` (prefer the server-selected track over the eng heuristic) and route.rs:586-615 (seed CUR_SUB_SID from the selected subtitle). PMS: the Stream[] already returned by GET /library/metadata/{rk}; no extra round trip.
  *Device:* none known — the data is already on the wire and already parsed; this is field plumbing plus one ladder rung in a host-tested pure function (route.rs:1007-1038 already covers pick_dp_audio).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. `pub selected: i64` is declared at rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs:268 (with a comment at :263 saying it 'mark[s] … the server's current pick') and is read NOWHERE — `rg '\.selected\b'` over the crate hits only ui/detail.rs's unrelated `view().selected` and PlayQueue's play_queue_selected_item_*. metadata.rs:374-401 `convert_streams` maps id/index/lang/lang_code/codec/channels/layout/title/sdh/ad/forced/default/external and drops `selected`, so metadata::Stream has no field for it. The direct-play branch returns at route.rs:615, BEFORE `put_selection` at route.rs:640 (transcode bran

- **Account subtitle preferences implemented by #222.** Direct playback inherits account language, mode and forced preferences after PMS selection and explicit show preferences. Automatic selection does not introduce a transcode burn; the live PMS propagation measurement remains outstanding.

- **Image-subtitle bitmaps are drawn at raw stream coordinates with no scaling from the subtitle canvas — VobSub/DVD subs land as a postage stamp** — `major` / `small`
  The decoded AVSubtitleRect x/y/w/h are in the SUBTITLE stream's own authoring canvas, which is 1920x1080 for PGS from a Blu-ray but 720x480 or 720x576 for VobSub/dvd_subtitle rips (and 3840x2160 for some 4K PGS). We assume 1920x1080 unconditionally and composite the rect 1:1 into the UI canvas, so a DVD-sourced VobSub track renders tiny and misplaced in the upper-left quadrant instead of across the bottom of the picture. The menu happily offers those tracks (they get a VOBSUB badge).
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ff.rs:775-819 (read the sub decoder's canvas w/h and pass a scale, or normalise the rect to 0..1) → rust-modules/src/player/mod.rs:251-271 (SubBitmap) → rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:109-139 (scale into the 1920x1080 UI canvas).
  *Device:* Reading the canvas size means one more field off the TV's own libavcodec AVCodecContext (or AVSubtitle's declared dimensions) — a NEW verified ABI offset on ffmpeg-3.3/armv7, exactly the class the bind-tv-lib-abi skill exists for; a wrong offset is silent memory corruption with no debugger. The safer variant scales from the ALREADY-read rect extents plus the video's own dimensions. Drawing itself is a Painter::tex rect — free, and the video plane is untouched.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/ff.rs:775-819 `decode_bitmap_cue` reads `(*r0).x/y/w/h` and pushes them unchanged via `push_subtitle_bitmap(track, pts, x, y, w, h, rgba)`; the doc at ff.rs:778-779 explicitly asserts 'The PGS authoring canvas is 1920×1080 (== our UI, confirmed on-device), so x/y/w/h are pixel coords used directly by the renderer'. Nothing reads AVCodecContext width/height (grep for canvas/scale in ff.rs finds only swscale/venc uses). player_hud.rs:128 `RECT = (x as f32, y as f32, w as f32, h as f32)` then :135 `Painter::root().tex(TEX, Rect::new(RECT.0..3), ...)` — verbatim. track_

- **ASS/SSA styling — implemented for direct play**. Embedded scripts retain their headers,
  complete timed events and font attachments; sidecars retain the full ASS/SSA file instead of
  requesting an SRT conversion. Bundled libass renders positioning, styles, overlapping events,
  drawings, movement and karaoke on a worker. The player owns the cached RGBA texture; the UI
  thread never parses a script or rasterizes a font. See `docs/ass-subtitles.md`.

- **Long subtitle cues are silently truncated: a 42-CHARACTER wrap and a hard 3-line cap that DROPS the rest** — `minor` / `small`
  The plain-text subtitle renderer word-wraps by character count (42) rather than by pixels, then keeps only the first three lines and discards the remainder without an ellipsis. 42 characters at 36px is roughly 750px — under 40% of the panel width — so ordinary long sentences (SDH captions, Cyrillic dubs) wrap to four or more lines and the tail of the sentence is simply never shown. The codebase already owns a pixel word-wrapping primitive that the HUD does not use here.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:38-102 — either widen/measure with crate::text::text_width or move the caption onto ui/text_view.rs's TextView (noting the renderer is a documented immediate-mode carve-out, ui/CLAUDE.md).
  *Device:* none known — main-thread GLES text drawing that already runs every frame; TTF_SizeUTF8 measurement is memoised elsewhere in the same file (player_hud.rs:171-191) if per-frame measuring is a concern on the Mali budget.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:38-57 `fn wrap(s: &str, max: usize)` counts `chars()`, called at :73 as `wrap(seg, 42)`; :73-77 `for l in wrap(seg, 42) { if lines.len() < 3 { lines.push(l); } }` — the 4th line and beyond are dropped with no ellipsis and no marker. The pixel-accurate alternative exists and is used elsewhere in the same screen family: rust-modules/src/ui/text_view.rs (greedy pixel word-wrap at :132-157, `max_lines` with an ellipsized last line at :83-85/:142-158, `measure_h`), consumed by info_panel.rs and detail.rs:1512/1582. minor/small is right. device_risk 'none

- **The transport discs carry no state — the CC button looks identical whether subtitles are on or off, and neither disc names the current track** — `minor` / `small`
  In Plex HTPC the CC glyph reflects whether subtitles are enabled and the pickers make the current selection obvious from the transport. Our TransportButton renders a static icon whose only two states are focused/idle; there is no on/off tint, no dot, and no label of the active language, so "are subtitles on?" can only be answered by opening the menu or waiting for a cue.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs:403-437 (an `active: bool` builder + a theme token for the on-state) and rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:388-391.
  *Device:* none known — a widget state variant drawn through the existing Painter; needs one new theme token per the ui/CLAUDE.md no-inline-colour rule.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/ui/widgets.rs:400-437 `impl View for TransportButton` has exactly one branch — `if self.focused { (ACCENT, ACCENT_INK) } else { (theme::CONTROL_IDLE_FILL, theme::CONTROL_IDLE_INK) }` — and the icon is `match self.which { 1 => Icon::Audio, _ => Icon::Cc }`. The struct has only `frame`, `which`, `focused` (widgets.rs:404-408) and the only builder is `.focused()` (widgets.rs:413-416). Constructed at rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:389-390 inside the `ControlSlot::Discs` arm with nothing but `.focused(...)`. The live state is indeed one call away and unconsulted: `pla

- **Subtitle rows don't show the format for TEXT tracks, don't mark sidecars as External, and audio rows label the default track "Original:" rather than "Default"** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex HTPC labels each subtitle with its format (SRT / PGS / VobSub / ASS) and marks the default; sidecar tracks are visibly external. We badge the codec only for IMAGE subs, so SRT and ASS rows look identical despite their different rendering capabilities; external tracks (visible while transcoding) are indistinguishable from embedded ones; and the audio label prefixes the file's default track with "Original:", which conflates the container's default flag with the original-language track — a Russian-dubbed file flagged default reads as "Original: Russian". PMS's own displayTitle/extendedDisplayTitle, which carry exactly these composites, are parsed and unused.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs:232-320 (labels/badges), optionally consuming rust-modules/src/plex/models.rs:253-254 displayTitle via metadata::convert_streams (metadata.rs:374-401).
  *Device:* none known — all fields are already parsed and on the main thread; Badge::Text already exists for the string form.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED on all three counts. rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs:313-315 adds a codec badge only `if is_image_sub_codec(&s.codec)` — SRT/ASS/mov_text get nothing. Sub badges are only Forced (:309) and Sdh (:311); Badge has no External/Default variant (ui/table.rs:16-33: Ad|Forced|Sdh|Cc|Text). track_menu.rs:240 `let label = if s.default { format!("Original: {lang}") } else { lang.to_string() }`. plex/models.rs:254 `display_title` is parsed and read NOWHERE (the sole grep hit is its own declaration); note `extendedDisplayTitle` is not even parsed, so that one would need adding to models.rs too.

- **Every audio-track switch tears down and re-Loads the whole pipeline — a ~1s stall even for a same-codec sibling track** — `minor` / `large`
  Plex HTPC switches audio tracks instantly on a direct-played file. Here ANY audio pick — even English AC3 → Russian AC3 in the same MKV, where nothing about the decoder configuration changes — goes through switch_audio_native → reload_at → full teardown + fresh Load, which the engine's own comment prices at a ~1s re-preroll (black/rebuffer). The non-direct-playable case (DTS/TrueHD) additionally does a server round trip and drops the item out of direct play into a transcode, with no warning in the menu that the pick will cost picture quality.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/player/engine.rs:484-493 + rust-modules/src/player/pump.rs:54-63 (a lane-flush fast path when codec/layout/rate are unchanged); a menu affordance would live in rust-modules/src/ui/track_menu.rs:232-258.
  *Device:* High for the fast path. The Starfish Load payload DECLARES the audio codec and (for AAC) the core sample rate, and ACB rebinds on Load — player/CLAUDE.md is explicit that describing the wrong audio to the decoder gives silent audio. The demuxer also picks its stream at open (SHARED.desired_audio_idx is read by the demux thread on every reopen, engine.rs:332), and the PTS-rebase/segment machinery is built around reload. This is precisely the stale-audio-silence class the harness already guards (tests/manifest.json:381 "audio-post-seek"), so an in-place switch needs on-device proof, not reasoning. The transcode-forcing case cannot be made instant at all — it is a server encode restart.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. rust-modules/src/player/engine.rs:484-493 `switch_audio_native` stores desired_audio_idx then calls `reload_at(mt, pos_ns)`; `reload_at` (engine.rs:473-482) does `teardown(mt, true)` + `arm_seek` + `start_bufferfeed`, and its doc at engine.rs:464-472 prices it as 'Heavier than a flush (a ~1 s re-preroll)'. Dispatched from player/pump.rs:54-63 (the pending_audio_idx swap). The transcode-forcing branch is route.rs:920-934 `commit_audio_selection` → `player::request_audio_switch` → pump.rs:71-81 → `route::switch_audio` (route.rs:903-909) → `retranscode` + `reload_transcode`. The menu s

- **PGS/VobSub image subtitles don't lift for the HUD, and only rect 0 of a multi-rect display set is drawn** — `polish` / `small`
  Two smaller fidelity losses on the image path. (1) The text caption lifts from SCR_H-100 to SCR_H-300 when the transport is up, but the bitmap path takes no such argument, so a bottom-positioned PGS cue sits behind the HUD scrim and the scrubber while the user is seeking. (2) A PGS/DVB display set with several rects (two-line dialogue authored as separate rects, or a sign plus dialogue) renders only rect 0; the rest is logged and dropped.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/ui/player_hud.rs:109-139 + rust-modules/src/app.rs:2430 (pass hud_up and offset the composited rect); rust-modules/src/ff.rs:775-819 + rust-modules/src/player/mod.rs:251-271 (carry a Vec of rects per cue).
  *Device:* Lifting is free (a Painter rect offset). Multi-rect costs more RGBA in the 24 MB store (player/mod.rs:265) on a 32-bit heap and more per-display-set decode work on the demux core during 4K direct play — the reason the decode is already gated on subs being ON (ff.rs:1599-1604).
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, with a line-number correction. In the current working tree the calls are rust-modules/src/app.rs:2436 `crate::ui::player_hud::draw_subtitle_bitmap();` (no argument) versus app.rs:2438 `draw_subtitles(hud_up || matches!(route, Route::Player { overlay: Overlay::Menu }))` — the auditor cited 2430/2432, which is stale by six lines. `draw_subtitle_bitmap` (player_hud.rs:109-139) takes no hud_up parameter and composites at the cue's own y (player_hud.rs:128/135). Note the text path also lifts for an open TRACK MENU, not just the HUD, so a fix should pass the same expression, not just hud_

- **No subtitle search/download, and the detail page lists audio languages but not subtitle languages** — `polish` / `medium`
  Two smaller reference-parity items. Plex servers expose an agent-backed subtitle search (the item's "Search subtitles" flow) which several Plex clients surface; we have no path to acquire a subtitle that is not already on disk, which compounds the sidecar gap above. Separately, the detail page's About block enumerates the audio languages and codecs but never the subtitle languages, so the pre-play page cannot answer "does this have Russian subs?" — the CC/SDH badges only say that SOME subtitle exists.
  *Where:* rust-modules/src/plex/library.rs (a subtitle-search + apply client method) and rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1446-1467 (a Subtitles row beside the Audio one — data already present).
  *Device:* The About-block row is free (data already parsed, main thread). A subtitle search is a PMS agent operation whose response times are long and unbounded — it must run on a task::spawn_small worker with the house mailbox idiom, never on the SDL loop, and the downloaded result lands as a sidecar, so it is blocked behind the sidecar-rendering gap above.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED both halves. No subtitle-search endpoint exists anywhere in rust-modules/src/plex; the account client's `/api/v2/user` call is unrelated preference data. Detail About block: rust-modules/src/ui/detail.rs:1446-1457 builds `orig_audio` from `d.audio.first()` and `audio_list` from `d.audio.iter().take(8)` as 'Lang (CODEC)'; d.subs is consulted only at :1459-1460 for the `cc`/`sdh` booleans that feed the Accessibility chips (:1462-1467), and the drawn Languages column (:1575-1583) has only 'Original Audio' + 'Audio'. metadata::Detail does ca

#### Playback information overlay, scrub preview and playback lifecycle

*Already implemented here: 22 reference features.*

- **Server loss or a pipeline error mid-playback was a silent freeze** — `blocker` / `medium`
  The failure signals now enter a cause-aware Error read-out after playback too. The read-out offers OK quality/retry and BACK; retry performs a real stop plus fresh resolve from the retained position rather than attempting to keep driving the dead Engine.
  *Where:* `player/pump.rs` owns terminal producer/Load failures, `player::error_now` maps the concrete cause, `ui/player_hud.rs::draw_failed_readout` renders it, and `app::retry_failed_playback` owns the main-thread restart.
  *Verified:* RESOLVED in the current tree; automatic retry policy remains intentionally narrower than detection and explicit recovery.

- **~~No Playback Information / stats overlay exists at all~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31**
  `app::diagnostics` is a live playback Diagnostics overlay reached through the player's overflow. Its two-column layout presents source/output facts and delivery/control evidence without elision, and uses explicit unknown values where PMS or webOS exposes no measurement. Development automation may open it off-player to capture device facts, without adding that instrument to the profile menu.
  *Historical proposal:* add a stats panel and thread live route/player facts into it; the current implementation lives in `app/diagnostics.rs` and is toggled through the player's overflow.
  *Device:* Most of it is cheap: the direct-play/transcode verdict, the codecs actually fed to the Load payload, fps, queue bytes and duration are already in-process. Two fields are genuinely hard on this device. (1) DROPPED FRAMES: nothing counts them - sf_on_event only increments SHARED.frames on a type=0 "presented" callback (player/mod.rs:357-363) and the Starfish/ACB seam in src/starfish.c exposes no decoder-statistics symbol, so a drop count would have to be inferred from fed-vs-presented PTS deltas rather than measured. (2) DECODER hw/sw is a constant here - buffer-feed always decodes on the panel's hardware, so the field is honest but uninteresting. "Buffer ahead" is also nearly meaningless as drawn elsewhere: MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS is 1.6 s (player/engine.rs:673) with an 8 MB video AU queue (player/engine.rs:39), so the real number is single-digit seconds, not the tens-of-seconds Plex shows. Adding Media width/height/bitrate to the DTO is free (plex/models.rs is all `#[serde(default)]`); a /status/sessions GET for transcodeReason is one more JSON round trip through the existing client and safe.
  *Historical audit evidence:* the cited grep and overlay enum described the earlier tree; current reachability is pinned by `app::diagnostics` and menu tests.

- **No BIF thumbnail preview while scrubbing** — `major` / `large`
  Plex floats a still from the scrub position above the scrubber, served from /library/parts/<id>/indexes/sd. Our scrubber draws a bar, a knob and two clock labels and nothing else - scrubbing 40 minutes forward is done blind against a frozen picture.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs (a preview tile above the bar, fed from the same `dispos` the clocks already use at :400-411), a new BIF fetcher/parser module beside posters.rs, and a new plex/library.rs method for GET /library/parts/{id}/indexes/sd. The part id is already parsed and stored (route.rs:710-718 part_id_of, CUR_PART_ID at route.rs:845).
  *Device:* Two real device constraints. (1) MEMORY: a BIF for a feature film is tens of MB of concatenated JPEGs and pkg/appinfo.json declares requiredMemory 160, against a measured 152 MiB peak - a whole-file download would be an allocation abort, not a caught panic (see img.rs:1-12 on why catch_unwind cannot save an alloc failure). The workable shape is a Range GET of the BIF header/index, then a Range GET of one frame's byte extent; stream.rs supports exactly this (ff.rs:988-992 already does Range reopens), and the JPEG decoder in img.rs can decode the extracted frame. (2) stream.rs DOES decode chunked transfer (`hs_next_chunk`), so the framing was never the question - its only disqualifiers are DNS and TLS. This line claimed the opposite, which is the exact false claim the former root guide (now `docs/agent-reference.md`) holds up as this repo's archetype. Also note the server must have generated video preview thumbnails at all - many libraries have them off, so the feature needs a clean absent-index fallback.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. No BIF/indexes code anywhere in rust-modules/src (only unrelated prose uses of "indexes"). player_hud.rs:394-464 is the entire scrubber — track, fill, knob, elapsed clock (draw_clock), remaining clock, pause/spinner glyph — and the only asset fetcher is resolve_tex → image_transcode_path (widgets.rs:14-36 → transcoder.rs:52-62), which can only build /photo/:/transcode. CORRECTION to the evidence: the endpoint is not undocumented here — the vendored docs/plex-openapi.json DOES carry `/library/parts/{partId}/indexes/{index}` (:14077) and `/library/parts/{partId}/indexes/{index}/{offse

- **Chapters are unavailable for any episode started from a show detail page** — `major` / `small`
  The Chapters tab and strip read `metadata::current()`, which during an episode play launched from the show page is the SHOW, not the episode. A show container carries no Chapter[], so has_chapters() is false and the tab never appears - even for episodes that do have chapter data on the server.
  *Where:* metadata.rs:425-431 (add `chapters` to PlayingItem) + metadata.rs:463-479 (fetch_playing_item already calls client.metadata(), which requests includeChapters=1 - plex/library.rs:59-65 - so the data is already on the wire and thrown away), then repoint ui/chapters_panel.rs:34/37/91/116 at metadata::playing().
  *Device:* none known - no extra PMS request, no player-engine involvement; the response already contains Chapter[] and is being discarded.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, and the path-dependence is exactly as described. chapters_panel reads metadata::current() in all four places (n() :33-35, has_chapters() :36-39, on_ok() :88-95, draw() :112-121), and player_hud.rs:468 hides the Chapters tab on has_chapters(). detail.rs::play_episode_at (:1356-1392) only sets NowPlaying — the comment "current() stays on the show here" is at :1374 — and never requests the episode's own detail. PlayingItem carries rk/audio/subs/video_fps/markers and NOT chapters (metadata.rs:423-430); fetch_playing_item (metadata.rs:467-480) calls Client::metadata, which DOES send incl

- **No post-play card, and no Up Next at all when the item has no credits marker** — `major` / `medium`
  Up Next is gated entirely on a CREDITS marker being under the playhead. An item whose server has no credits detection - very common outside recent Plex versions and for older libraries - gets no tile, no countdown and no warning: the episode simply reaches EOS and the next one starts as a hard cut. Plex falls back to a time/percentage threshold near the end and always shows a post-play card.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:252-272 (a position-derived fallback offer when there is no credits marker - e.g. last N seconds or >95% of duration_ns, both already available via player::duration_ns/playpos_ns) and app.rs:761-773 finish_playback (show the tile with its countdown before starting the successor, rather than cutting).
  *Device:* none known. The countdown, the tile and the auto-start already exist (ui/up_next.rs) and the successor descriptor is already resolved at play time (route.rs:403-460), so this is a widening of the trigger condition, not new machinery. One caveat specific to us: the EOS detector needs `duration_ns > 0` (player/pump.rs:285), and duration comes from the demuxer, so a percentage-based fallback inherits that dependency.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. slot_for returns ControlSlot::Discs for `marker: None` regardless of has_next (player_hud.rs:252-264), asserted deliberately at player_hud.rs:505 ("a queued successor alone changes nothing"). finish_playback's doc says outright "There is no interstitial: 'always the next episode'" (app.rs:758-760) and calls play_up_next immediately (app.rs:768); the EOS trigger is app.rs:2089-2092. plex/models.rs:299-320 records the uneven marker coverage on this very library. PARTIAL (large, and the reason effort is medium not large): the whole apparatus already exists and is wired — the tile, the

- **No mid-playback rebuffering indicator** — `major` / `small`
  PlaybackState::Buffering requires `frames == 0`, so it only ever describes the pre-roll. If the feed starves after playback has begun - a slow LAN, a transcoder that falls behind - the picture simply stops moving with no spinner, no caption and (with the HUD auto-hidden) nothing on screen at all.
  *Where:* player/pump.rs:271-279 (derive a mid-playback stall: unpaused, no seek in flight, `SHARED.frames` not advancing across N pump ticks) and ui/player_hud.rs:352-358 (drop the frames==0 gate for that case, and raise the HUD so the user sees it).
  *Device:* none known - it is a derivation from counters the pump already reads every frame. The one care needed is not to false-positive while paused or while a seek's prime-then-play window is open (player/engine.rs:816-829), both of which are already distinguishable from existing state.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, double-gated exactly as claimed. pump.rs:271-279 publishes Buffering only when `SHARED.frames.load() == 0`; once any frame is presented the state is unconditionally Playing (there is no starvation term anywhere in the derivation). player_hud.rs:354-358 then re-gates the overlay on `s.is_busy() && crate::player::frames() == 0`, so even a hypothetical post-first-frame Buffering would draw nothing. HUD_LINGER_MS is 4500 (app.rs:557) and the auto-hide re-parks focus at app.rs:2249-2251, so a stall is visually identical to a still frame. PARTIAL: the caption string already exists (`c"Buf

- **The scrubber draws no chapter ticks, and there is no chapter-skip key** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex marks chapter boundaries on the scrub bar and lets you jump chapter-to-chapter without opening a panel. Our chapters are reachable only by navigating HUD focus to the tabs row, right-arrowing to "Chapters", pressing OK, walking the strip and pressing OK again - four steps to skip one chapter, and the bar itself carries no indication that chapters exist.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:412-418 (tick marks over the track, from the same chapter list ui/chapters_panel.rs:34 reads) and app.rs:1570-1575 (extend the CH-key arm to the player route, calling request_seek to the previous/next chapter start).
  *Device:* none known - this is pure UI over data already in memory, and a chapter jump is an ordinary request_seek, which the existing in-place-seek path handles.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player_hud.rs:412-418 draws RAIL_TRACK then the white fill and nothing between; nothing in player_hud.rs reads metadata::current().chapters. CH▲/CH▼ (WCODE_CH_UP/DOWN, consts.rs:45-46) are bound only inside `matches!(route, Route::Library)` (app.rs:1570-1575) and are dead on the player route. ui/chapters_panel.rs is the only chapter affordance, reached via focus row 2 → RIGHT → OK → walk → OK. PARTIAL worth knowing: the "which chapter contains the playhead" math a prev/next skip needs already exists — chapters_panel::open() at :41-53 does `rposition(|c| c.start_ms <= pos_ms)` agains

- **No auto-skip preference for intro/credits** — `minor` / `medium`
  Plex offers "Skip intro automatically" / "Skip credits automatically". Our Skip button is always manual; entering an intro raises the HUD and parks focus on the button, which is the opposite behaviour for a user who has opted into auto-skip.
  *Where:* ui/skip_pill.rs (an arm/expire pair modelled on ui/up_next.rs:46-93), app.rs:2202-2230 (fire the skip when the preference is on), plus a persisted preference and rows in the existing `screens/settings.rs` surface (`ui/settings.rs` before phase 5b, 2026-09-07).
  *Device:* none known for the skip itself. The absent piece is infrastructure, not device: there is no client-preference persistence at all today (plex/session.rs stores only auth state), so the first preference pays for the store.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. ui/skip_pill.rs is 86 lines of prompt_for/rect/draw with no timer and no auto-fire; app.rs:2202-2246 is the whole marker reaction and only logs the offer, extend_hud's the HUD and moves hud_nav.focus to row 1 — it never calls request_seek. No general preference store exists; `screens/settings.rs` has no auto-skip rows. CORRECTION worth flagging: the app already ships an unconditional AUTOMATIC behaviour of exactly this class with

- **No playback speed control (0.5x-2x)** — `minor` / `large`
  Plex HTPC offers variable-rate playback. We have exactly one rate. There is no UI, no key binding, and no engine call.
  *Where:* src/starfish.c (a new mangled `setPlayRate` binding, via the bind-tv-lib-abi skill), player/ffi.rs + player/mod.rs (a rate wrapper taking the MainThread token), the feed throttle in player/engine.rs:673-707 (MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS is a wall-clock-derived budget that assumes 1x), and a control in ui/player_hud.rs / ui/track_menu.rs.
  *Device:* The highest-risk item in this report. We do not drive a URI player - we hand-feed access units into a BUFFERSTREAM pipeline whose GStreamer segment we re-anchor by hand on every seek (player/pump.rs:148-200, player/engine.rs:464-482 records how a stale segment produced permanent BufferFull and "Playing error"). A rate change is a segment-rate change; if `setPlayRate` is absent from this webOS 4.5 libplayerAPIs (unverified - it is not in the seam today, and the stub-.so link trick means a wrong symbol links fine and only fails at runtime), the only alternative is re-timestamping AUs ourselves, which desynchronises audio and fights the feed-ahead throttle. Audio pitch handling would also be the pipeline's problem, not ours. Treat as "prove the symbol exists on device first, then decide".
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED, including the device risk. src/starfish.c binds exactly: SMP_ctor/dtor/Load/Feed/Play/Unload/notifyForeground/isLoadCompleted/Pause/flush/pushEOS/setTimeToDecode plus CP_sendSegmentEvent/CP_loadSpi_getInfo/CP_setContentInfo — no setPlayRate, no rate symbol of any kind. A case-insensitive grep for playrate|playbackrate|setplayrate|speed over rust-modules/src and src/ returns only app.rs:2164's scrub ramp. CLARIFICATION: that ramp is the nearest existing thing and is worth naming precisely — SCRUB_BASE 10 → SCRUB_ACCEL 45/s → SCRUB_MAX 140 playback-seconds per real-second (app.rs:547-

- **No jump-to-time entry, no frame step, and no on-screen skip-back-10 / skip-forward-30 buttons** — `minor` / `medium`
  Seeking is only LEFT/RIGHT (Skip-interval taps, 10 s by default, or an accelerating hold) and pointer drag. There is no numeric time entry, no single-frame step, and the transport shows no skip buttons - a pointer/Magic-Remote user has no clickable way to nudge by a fixed amount at all.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:275-297 and :388-391 (extra control-row slots + hit-tests; note CTRL_PAIR_W at :162 exists precisely so row occupants keep a stable width), ui/icons.rs (two new masks), app.rs:1513-1569 (bind them), plus a numeric-entry popover if jump-to-time is wanted - ui/profiles.rs already contains a working PIN keypad that could be generalised.
  *Device:* Skip buttons are free. FRAME STEP is not: buffer-feed has no step primitive - src/starfish.c exposes Play/Pause/flush only, and a paused seek already has to briefly Play to decode and present the target frame then re-freeze (app.rs:262-270 commit_seek, app.rs:2251-2261 the re-pause gate). Single-frame stepping would mean a flush + av_seek + prime + Play + re-pause per frame, roughly a second each on this device - effectively unusable, so scope frame-step out rather than build it badly.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. app.rs:1513-1569 is the complete player seek arm (LEFT/RIGHT taps + the 0x101-driven hold ramp); SCRUB_STEP_NS = 10 s at app.rs:546 (as audited; now `player_hud::scrub_step_ns()`, the Skip interval preference). The control row draws only the two TransportButtons (player_hud.rs:388-391 via btn_x :275-282) or a single stand-in, and icon_hit yields only 0/1 (player_hud.rs:289-297). ui/icons.rs has no skip glyph (Cc, Audio, Check, Chevron/Down/Up, Ring, UnwatchedAngle, Play, Pause, Info, User, Backspace). No FF/REW wcodes are defined at all — consts.rs:49-51 has only PAUSE 72 / STOP 413 / PLAY 450. The pause glyph's "state read-out, not an action toggle" note is

- **No resume-vs-restart prompt: playback silently resumes, and the choice is only reachable after playback starts** — `minor` / `small`
  Plex asks (or offers two buttons) when an item has a resume point. We auto-resume anything past 10 s with no prompt and no indication of where it will land; the only way to start over is to begin playback, open the HUD, walk to the Info tab, open the card and pick "From Beginning".
  *Where:* ui/detail.rs:827-840 (a "Resume from 1:12:04" label on the pill plus a "Play from Beginning" sibling, or a small prompt) and app.rs's start_playback callers, which already have the resume value in hand. metadata::resume_ns (metadata.rs:12-18) is the shared policy and should stay the single source of the threshold.
  *Device:* none known - the resume value is already computed and already threaded to the one place that arms it (player/engine.rs:450-462); passing 0 instead is a one-line difference at the call site.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. metadata::resume_ns (metadata.rs:12-18) applies >10 s and <95% with no prompt, and every caller feeds it straight into start_playback (app.rs:660-712 and its callers at :834, :875, :950, :1449-1457, :2293). The detail page's hero is Play + watched-toggle only — NBTN = 2 (detail.rs:88), drawn as a fixed `c"Play"` pill at detail.rs:833-836 with no timecode and no sibling restart. The only restart affordance is info_panel's "From Beginning" (info_panel.rs:48-50 / :74-79), inside the player. PARTIAL the auditor missed: the HOME hero pill already labels the resume state — home.rs:425 `le

- **Timeline state changes are only reported on the 10 s tick, and buffering is never reported** — `minor` / `small`
  Official clients POST /:/timeline immediately on pause, resume, seek and stop. We post on a fixed 10 s cadence that merely samples the paused flag, so /status/sessions and any Plex remote can be up to 10 s stale about what this player is doing, and `state=buffering` is never sent at all.
  *Where:* player/threads.rs:37-93 (an immediate-post nudge alongside the existing stop condvar) and the transport handlers in app.rs:1420-1430 / 1482-1512 / 262-270.
  *Device:* One real hazard, already learned the hard way here: /:/timeline POSTs must not run on the SDL thread. route.rs:147-159 records a measured 6974 ms main-loop park from a stalled timeline POST (tools/netcond.py, stall@/:/timeline), which is why the reporter is a thread and the stop scrobble was moved off-loop. An immediate report must therefore be a wake of the existing worker, never an inline post from the key handler.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED with one correction. player/threads.rs:22 REPORT_INTERVAL_S = 10 and :73-93 waits the full interval before sampling TX.paused and posting; route::report_timeline (route.rs:956-973) has exactly two callers — that loop (threads.rs:90) and the stop scrobble. Nothing in the pause/resume key arms (app.rs:1423-1430, 1482-1509), the pointer play/pause (app.rs:1698-1705) or commit_seek (app.rs:262-270) touches the reporter. TimelineState is Playing|Paused|Stopped only (params.rs:73-88) — no Buffering, so state=buffering is literally unrepresentable, not just unsent. CORRECTION: STOP is not o

- **The session is registered as a player but is not actually remote-controllable** — `minor` / `large`
  We create a PlayQueue and report a timeline, so the session appears in Now Playing - but nothing listens for control commands, so a phone or Plex Web cannot pause, seek or change tracks on this TV. plex/timeline.rs's own doc calls this "a first-class, remote-controllable player", which overstates what is built.
  *Where:* A new control server (a small HTTP listener plus the /player/playback/{play,pause,seekTo,stepForward,setParameters} and /player/timeline/{poll,subscribe} endpoints) feeding the same request_seek / pause / resume entry points app.rs already uses, and X-Plex-Provides advertising in plex/client.rs's playback_identity.
  *Device:* Genuinely awkward here. There is no HTTP server in the app and stream.rs is a client-only raw-socket implementation with no chunked encoding and no request parsing (stream.rs), so the whole server side would be new code on a 32-bit ARM device with a 60 MB memory declaration. Every control action must also be marshalled onto the SDL main thread - pause/resume/seek all reach the ACB/Starfish seam behind the compile-enforced MainThread token (player/mod.rs:7-12, player/ffi.rs) - so the listener needs a mailbox drained in the frame loop, like route::pump_play (route.rs:813-823). Correct but not small.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. No HTTP listener outside capture.rs's dev UI-capture socket (capture.rs:205) and the unit tests' loopback fixtures (stream.rs:680/712/759/777, ff.rs:1823); no /player/playback/*, no /player/timeline/{poll,subscribe}, no X-Plex-Target-Client-Identifier handling anywhere in plex/. PARTIAL, and it cuts both ways: the ADVERTISING half is already done — `const PROVIDES: &str = "player"` is sent on every playback request via playback_identity (client.rs:44, :62-72) alongside a stable X-Plex-Client-Identifier, Device-Name "Living Room TV" and Model — which is precisely why the session show

- **~~The transcode ladder is fixed and invisible~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31**
  The persisted quality picker controls the initial decision and every reload/seek, while Diagnostics shows the requested actuator separately from the response PMS actually delivered. Auto uses the measured 13-point actuator ladder; fixed choices remain available when automatic or Original playback fails.
  *Historical proposal:* thread a quality parameter through decision/reload/seek and expose it in player UI; the landed control is in `ui::more_menu`, not `ui::track_menu`.
  *Device:* Low but non-trivial to get right on this pipeline. A quality change is not a parameter tweak at the player: route.rs:865-902 retranscode + player/engine.rs:500-510 reload_transcode rebuild the URL and do a FULL fresh Load, because the Load payload's codecs must match the server's actual output (player/CLAUDE.md, route.rs:301-321) - so switching quality costs the same ~1 s reload an audio switch does. Also note the ladder is deliberately aggressive for a reason recorded in plex/transcoder.rs:27-46: capping lower risks losing the HEVC/10-bit target that keeps 4K HDR10 intact, so a naive "720p" rung would quietly change more than bitrate.
  *Historical audit evidence:* the parameter had already landed when this duplicate was written, but its search looked only in the Audio/Subtitles menu and missed the overflow quality picker. The current route and Diagnostics tests are authoritative.

- **The scrubber shows no buffered-ahead extent** — `polish` / `small`
  Plex draws the downloaded/buffered region behind the played fill. Our bar has only track and fill, so there is no signal about how much headroom the stream has - which is exactly the signal a user wants on a marginal network.
  *Where:* ui/player_hud.rs:412-418, using aq::aq_bytes on the two lanes (aq.rs:162, already logged per feed at player/engine.rs:834 and :900) or the demuxer's read-ahead offset in ff.rs's AvioState.
  *Device:* Real, and it argues for care rather than effort: this pipeline deliberately keeps a SHALLOW buffer. MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS is 1.6 s (player/engine.rs:673) and the AU queues are 8 MB video / 1 MB audio (player/engine.rs:39-40), because feeding further overfills the 4K HEVC DPB and stalls the sink. On a 2-hour film that is well under one pixel of a 1740 px bar. A truthful indicator here would have to show demuxer read-ahead (bounded by the same queue cap) rather than Plex's tens-of-seconds notion, or be dropped as meaningless on this device - decide that before building it.
  *Verified:* CONFIRMED. player_hud.rs:412-418 draws RAIL_TRACK then the fill with nothing between. theme::RAIL_BUFFERED (theme.rs:159, doc: "Buffered-ahead / resume-track band") is used at exactly one site and it is not the player — detail.rs:967, as the unfilled track behind an EPISODE CARD's resume bar. No shared ProgressBar type exists to inherit one from (widgets.rs has Button/CircleButton/TransportButton/TabPill/Spinner/PageDots/StatusOverlay/card only), matching ui/CLAUDE.md. The device caveat is accurate and I would weight it harder than 'polish': MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS is 1_600_000_000 (engine.rs:673) w
