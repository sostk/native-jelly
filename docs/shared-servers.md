# Shared (non-owned) Plex servers — how Plex structures them, and how to integrate one

**Status:** design note, 2026-08-11; landed-work section refreshed 2026-08-23. Written after being
granted access to a friend's server. Everything in §2 was **measured live** against that server,
from the dev Mac *and* from the TV itself. Everything in §1 is Plex's model as documented by its own
client libraries. §5's plan is sequenced; **§9 is the record of what has actually landed**, and it
is the section to read before starting a step. The HTTPS transport and the raced direct/relay
discovery policy are now landed in the integration worktrees; their real-TV behavior remains a
device verification item rather than an unimplemented transport.

**Anonymisation — read this before adding an example anywhere in the repo.** Addresses, ports,
tokens, machine identifiers, the owner's username and their library names are deliberately **not**
recorded here or in any fixture, doc comment, commit message or PR body — the same redaction rule
`app/diagnostics.rs` applies to the diagnostics panel, and for a stronger reason: **this repository is
public, and none of that data is ours.** It belongs to the person who shared their server.

This paragraph stood here, in these words, while the repo published the friend's handle, their
machine name, their library name, their real port and their LAN address across ~139 sites in
committed code and four PR bodies (2026-08-14). Stating a rule is not applying it. The stand-ins
now used throughout — and the only ones to use in new work — are:

| real thing | stand-in |
|---|---|
| owner's plex.tv handle | `friend` |
| server / machine name | `nas-home` |
| their library name | `Film Club` |
| their port | `31234` |
| their LAN address | `10.9.9.7` (RFC1918, as the real one is) |
| any public address | `203.0.113.9` / `198.51.100.7` (TEST-NET-3 / TEST-NET-2) |
| a machine identifier | `aaaabbbb…` runs, never a real 40-hex id |

Several are deliberately the **same character length** as what they replaced, because the owned
Home's tests (`screens/home/tests.rs`) assert text widths against them. The live values live only in the gitignored
`tests/manifest.local.json` and `src/config.local.h`, which is the whole reason those files are
gitignored.

## 1. How Plex structures it

**The account is the index; each server is a separate authority.** Two APIs, two kinds of token.

`GET https://plex.tv/api/v2/resources?includeHttps=1&includeRelay=1&includeIPv6=1`, with the
**account** token, returns every server the account can reach — owned and shared alike:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `clientIdentifier` | the server's `machineIdentifier`; the only stable identity |
| `owned` | `false` ⇒ shared with you |
| `sourceTitle` | the **owner's plex.tv username**. This is what "shared" looks like on the wire, and it is the label Plex's own TV client shows |
| `accessToken` | **per (user, server)** — carries the sharing grant |
| `httpsRequired`, `publicAddressMatches`, `presence`, `home`, `relay` | connection-policy inputs |
| `connections[]` | `{protocol, address, port, uri, local, relay, IPv6}` |

The account token authenticates you to **plex.tv only**. Every PMS request must carry that server's
own `accessToken` — it decides which libraries you see and where your watch state is written.
Plex's own clients (python-plexapi `MyPlexResource.connect`, plex-for-kodi `plexresource.py`) always
use the per-resource token, never the account token; for an owner the two merely happen to coincide.

**`plex.direct`.** A public CA will not issue for a private IP, so Plex runs a wildcard DNS zone:
`A-B-C-D.<label>.plex.direct` resolves to `A.B.C.D`, and the server holds a real cert for
`*.<label>.plex.direct`. That is why `connections[].uri` is an https URL with a dashed-IP hostname.
Connecting to the bare IP over https fails validation by design.

**THE RULE IS: use the advertised `uri` VERBATIM, and never construct the hostname.** That is the
whole of what a client needs, it is what the official client does, and it is correct under either
answer to the question below — which is why it is stated first and separately.

**What the `<label>` actually is, is genuinely disputed, and this file used to pick a side without
saying so.** It read *"the `<hash>` label is the certificate UUID, **not** the machineIdentifier"*,
flatly. Meanwhile `docs/plex-openapi.json`'s `servers[0]` describes the very same label — its
`identifier` path variable in `https://{IP-description}.{identifier}.plex.direct:{port}` — as
*"The unique identifier of this particular PMS"*, with a 32-hex default, which reads as the
machineIdentifier. **Two sources in this repo disagree and neither is graded above the other:**
one is a note written from observation, the other is a published OpenAPI description; the shapes
are indistinguishable, because a machineIdentifier and a dashless UUID are both 32 hex characters,
so no sample settles it by inspection. It is left recorded as a disagreement rather than resolved,
because resolving it would take a server whose `machineIdentifier` is known and whose advertised
`uri` can be compared against it character by character, and nobody has done that.

**Neither answer changes what a client does**, which is the point. The official Plex client never
builds this hostname from an identifier it holds: it **regex-captures the label out of a `uri` the
resources API already gave it**, and the only hostname it ever assembles itself is the loopback form
`127-0-0-1.<label>.plex.direct` — where the label is again one it extracted, not one it derived. So
the safe rule survives the ambiguity intact: **the label is data you copy, never data you compute.**
Treat any code that would build `plex.direct` out of a `clientIdentifier` as a bug even if the
OpenAPI reading turns out to be the right one, because the failure mode is a TLS validation error
against a certificate you cannot inspect from the TV.

**Relay** is a tunnel the server holds open to a Plex relay host: another https connection, flagged
`relay:true`, conventionally port 8443, capped at **2 Mbps** with the server transcoding down to
fit. Last resort. The preference order in every client that has one is **local → remote → relay**.

**Everything item-shaped is per-server.** `ratingKey`, `librarySectionID`, `Part.key`, `Stream.id`,
`playQueueID`, personIds and image-transcode paths are all server-local integers starting at 1. The
only portable identity is the `guid` (`plex://movie/…`). Plex makes the scoping explicit in its own
grammar: a PlayQueue is created with
`uri=server://{machineIdentifier}/com.plexapp.plugins.library/library/metadata/{ratingKey}` —
which this repo already builds, at `rust-modules/src/plex/timeline.rs:56`.

**Consequences, all client-side:**

- PlayQueue creation, `/:/timeline`, `/:/scrobble`, `/decision` and `transcode_stop` must go to **the
  server the bytes came from**, with **that server's token**. `viewOffset` lives there. (One
  deliberate exception, and only for the watched FLAG: a Mark as Watched is repeated on every source
  holding the same `guid` — §11. Nothing else here fans out, and no `viewOffset` ever does.)
- **Nothing aggregates server-side.** `/hubs`, `/hubs/continueWatching` and search are single-server;
  Plex's own provider contract describes `continuewatching` as a hub "for merging into a global
  Continue Watching hub" — the merge is the client's job.
- `/library/sections` returns only the granted sections. Owner-only surfaces (`/:/prefs`, `/butler`,
  `/activities`, deletion) return 403.
- The connection recipe: filter `provides ∋ server` → rank → probe candidates in parallel →
  **verify `machineIdentifier` on the probe response** before accepting it → treat `401` as its own
  state (token problem, refetch `/resources`) rather than "unreachable". python-plexapi additionally
  **drops every `local` connection on a non-owned resource** (`myplex.py`). This client keeps only an
  advertised HTTPS URI for such a connection: TLS plus the identity response can authenticate it,
  while an advertised or synthesized plaintext form is suppressed. §2 shows exactly why.

---

## 2. What the actual shared server looks like (measured 2026-08-11)

`/api/v2/resources` for this account returns two servers: ours (`owned=true`) and the share
(`owned=false`, `sourceTitle` = the owner's username, `httpsRequired=false`, **no relay
connection**, per-server `accessToken` present). The share advertises three connections:

| connection | `local` | reachable from our LAN? |
|---|---|---|
| `172.20.x.x:32400` | **`true`** | **NO — 8 s timeout.** It is the *owner's* LAN address |
| `<custom hostname>:31234` | false | **NO — DNS does not resolve** (owner's internal name) |
| `<public IPv4>:31234` | false | **YES — 200 in 115 ms** |

Three findings, each load-bearing:

**(a) `local: true` is a trap.** The flag means "this address is RFC1918", not "*you* are on that
LAN" — `publicAddressMatches` is the field that means the latter, and it is `false` here. The old
selector (`auth::choose_local_connection`) picked the owner's `172.20.x.x` and hung for 8 seconds —
or, worse, could reach a *different machine* on our own LAN at that address. The current policy
suppresses plaintext for that unmatched shared-LAN connection, but retains its advertised HTTPS
URI and accepts it only after certificate and `machineIdentifier` verification.

**(b) The per-server token is mandatory, and provably so.** Against the share's
`/library/sections`: our own server's token → **401**; a garbage token → **401**; the share's
`accessToken` → **200**. (`/identity` answers 200 to anything — it is unauthenticated, so it is
useless as a token test but perfect as a reachability probe.)

**(c) The reachable connection speaks plain HTTP on a numeric IPv4 address.** Verified from the
**TV itself**, not just the Mac:

```
# on the TV
wget -q -T 8 -O - http://<public-ip>:31234/identity
→ <MediaContainer size="0" … machineIdentifier="…" version="1.43.3"/>   in 1.2 s
```

That unauthenticated `/identity` response proves the endpoint is reachable. It does not prove the
authenticated transport: stable browse and playback require an HTTPS origin, while token-bearing
plaintext is available only in an explicit developer-trigger lab build — or, for a numeric private
address on the television's own network, after the person consents (`plex::grant`). A public
endpoint like this one is remote and is never eligible.

Also measured, because they shape the playback story:

- The share is **one movie section, 185 items** — and its section key is **`1`**, exactly like our
  own server's `Movies`. Section keys and ratingKeys collide across the two servers today.
- A representative item: **MKV, h264 + TrueHD, 1080p, 31 Mbit/s, 20 GB**. A range GET of the real
  part over the WAN link sustained **38.8 Mbit/s** — so a direct play of that remux fits, with
  almost no headroom, and TrueHD will force at least an audio transcode.
- The share's `/hubs` answers normally and is scoped to *our* account (Continue Watching is empty,
  correctly — we have watched nothing there).

---

## 3. What the app did on 2026-08-11 — and what of it is still true

*The first three paragraphs describe the app as this note found it. Two of them have since been
answered (§9); they are kept because the collision table below is only readable against them.*

**It already fetched the whole list, then threw it away.** `plex/account.rs` requested
`?includeHttps=1&includeRelay=1`; `Resource` kept six fields and dropped `sourceTitle`, `ownerId`,
`home`, `presence`, `publicAddressMatches`, `httpsRequired`; `Connection.protocol` and
`Connection.uri` were parsed and never read. **Fixed** — the roster DTOs are widened and
null-tolerant (§9).

**`owned` is a preference, not a wall — FIXED.** The old chooser filtered both passes on
`c.local && !c.relay && !c.address.is_empty()`, so a remote-only server died before any transport
could try it. The live path now uses `probe.rs`, orders owned then `publicAddressMatches`, races
eligible direct candidates within one server, and holds relay for a second phase.

**One server, forever — FIXED.** `plex/client.rs` held a `static PLEX: OnceLock<Client>` whose host
and port froze at the first `install`, so a second `install` naming a *different* server was
silently just a token swap against the first one's address — a mis-target no call site could see.
`servers.rs` replaced it with a registry keyed on `machineIdentifier` (§9); `client()` still hands a
`&'static Client` to ~30 sites outside `plex/` and now means "the current server".

The globals that would collide across two servers — each an equality test or a bare index with no
server dimension. **Line numbers are as of 2026-08-11 and have moved; the entries themselves were
re-verified 2026-08-13 and all but one still hold:**

| site | what collides |
|---|---|
| `pms.rs:66-68` `index_of_rk` | `position(\|m\| m.rk == rk)`; callers `app.rs:1664`, `app.rs:2801`, `ui/detail.rs:2754`, `:2761`. A detail page mounts the wrong item |
| `posters.rs:449-452` | every poster fetched from the singleton's host — and this bypasses `client.rs`, contradicting its own module doc |
| `posters.rs:124-128` | `KeyMemo` keyed `(path,w,h,png)`: no host, no token. **Half-fixed:** it still carries no host, but token generations are now unique per `Client`, so the memo also flushes when `client()` starts answering with a different server — it used to flush only on a *profile* switch, which would have served server B its cards from A's memoised paths |
| `metadata.rs:834-843` | `cached_playing(rk)` — server A's track list applied to server B's item |
| `metadata.rs:1291-1307` | `pump_season`'s `d.rk != r.rk` ownership test |
| `browse.rs:32-36` | `BrowseSection.key: i64` — **verified collision**: both servers have section `1` |
| `route.rs:35` | `MACHINE_ID`, "cached once", feeds the PlayQueue `server://` uri |
| ~~`ui/trail.rs:42-59`~~ | `Node::Detail{rk}` — navigation history itself was server-less. **Retired with the file** (restructure phase 12, D1): the app keeps no second history, and a page's identity is its `AppArg` — `ContentArg::Detail{sid, rk}` carries the `plex::ServerId` the fix would have added, so the concern is structurally closed rather than outstanding |

Already server-agnostic, needing no work: `img.rs`, `player/engine.rs` + `threads.rs` (they consume
a full URL), `plex/discover.rs`, and the single `X-Plex-Client-Identifier` — one device on N servers
is *correct*; do not per-server it.

---

## 4. The blocker — and why it is smaller than it looks

The general answer is transport: `stream.rs:239-253` parses the host as a dotted quad by hand, so
DNS and TLS are both absent, and a `plex.direct` origin fails before a packet leaves the TV. Fixing
that properly means routing through libcurl (already bound, `net.rs:34-46`), which is ~1–1½ days for
the API + image lanes and a genuine **2–4 days** for the media lane, because FFmpeg's AVIO is *pull*
and curl is *push*, and `stream.rs`'s single-closer teardown protocol has to be re-earned in curl
terms. The bundled FFmpeg cannot help — it is built `--disable-network`,
`--enable-protocol=file` (`ci/build-ffmpeg.sh:122,129`) and pinned to majors 63/63/61.

**Offline (2026-09-05): the `plex.direct` name is dialled with no DNS at all.** A LAN whose uplink
is down resolves no `plex.direct` name, and the plaintext twin cannot carry a token in a store
build (a consented plaintext grant needs a fresh plex.tv resource list, which an offline boot does
not have), so the household's own server used to be unreachable exactly when it was the only thing
left. `rust-modules/net/src/net/origin.rs`'s `ResolvePin` (re-exported as `plex::ResolvePin`) keeps the https origin and hands libcurl the
`address` plex.tv advertised beside it through `CURLOPT_RESOLVE`, on both the control and the media
plane; the certificate is still validated against the name. `rust-modules/src/plex/CLAUDE.md` has
the rules, and `/tmp/nativejelly-nowan` is the reproduction.

**Offline, the who's-watching pick (2026-09-06).** A profile pick is a plex.tv call, so the pinned
origin alone still left the picker unable to seat anybody the first time the uplink really went
down. Every online seating now caches that profile's credentials in `Session::profiles` (a
PIN-protected one with a local verifier of the PIN, never the PIN), and a pick that plex.tv does
not answer is seated from the cache — an unprotected profile on the pick, a protected one on its
PIN. A profile that has never been seated online on this television has nothing cached, and the
picker says so: "No internet connection. Pick this profile once while online, and it will work
offline." One online sign-in and one online pick per profile are the whole precondition. `rust-modules/src/plex/CLAUDE.md` has the mechanism.

**Offline artwork.** Every reusable image transcode—posters, backdrops, logos, episode stills,
profile avatars and cast headshots—uses the shared disk tier in `rust-modules/platform/src/imgcache.rs`.
A hit is decoded locally before any network request. Entries are keyed by stable server identity,
source and transformation, with the outer request’s `X-Plex-Token` excluded; the volatile avatar roster stamp is ignored.
On a stale disk hit (after a day), cached art remains visible while a bounded background lane
attempts a refresh.
A missing image still requires its server (and, for proxied external art, that server's uplink).
Sign-out clears the cache and retires in-flight writes. See [image-cache.md](image-cache.md)
for bounds, lifecycle and the large-grid verification recipe.

**That plaintext endpoint is useful reachability evidence, not a stable authenticated route.**
§2(c) shows that the TV can reach it, but a public build still needs one of the server's advertised
HTTPS origins before it may attach the token. Connection selection and the multi-server data model
remain necessary; secure transport is part of the same acceptance path.

Two caveats that make TLS a real follow-up rather than a nicety:

1. **Historical risk, now closed for stable builds:** plain HTTP over the WAN puts
   `X-Plex-Token` in the clear. The current transport boundary refuses every token-bearing HTTP
   control or media URL unless the binary explicitly includes the developer-trigger feature, or
   the person consented to one verified numeric private origin on their own network
   (`plex::grant`) — never a WAN address like this one.
2. The plain-HTTP route is **the owner's setting, not ours**. If they flip *Require secure
   connections* to Required, or their port-forward stops exposing the plain port, it disappears and
   only the curl path reaches them. Same for any share that is relay-only.

---

## 5. The plan

Each step compiles, passes `make check`, and ships alone. Two standing hazards: `dynlib::load_into`
is all-or-nothing, so one missing libcurl symbol sets `CURL_OK=false` and kills plex.tv sign-in —
probe first, and put optional symbols in a **second** `dynlib!` table. And `plex/client.rs` has no
test module at all, so any step touching `StreamUrl::parse` must bring its own tests.

**Status is in the first cell of each row, and §9 is the account.** A step marked LANDED is done as
described unless the cell says otherwise; the plan text itself is left as written, because what it
asked for is how to read what shipped.

| # | Step | Effort | What it buys |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 **LANDED** | **Parse what plex.tv already sends.** Widen `Resource`/`Connection` (`account.rs:145-190`) with `sourceTitle`, `ownerId`, `home`, `presence`, `publicAddressMatches`, `httpsRequired`, `IPv6`; add `includeIPv6=1`; log one line per resource + connection. Selection untouched. **Every new string must be `Option<String>`** — plex.tv sends explicit `null`, serde's `default` does not cover it, and one nullable field fails the whole parse and kills sign-in (`account.rs:209-212` already records this trap). | ½ d | Observation |
| 1 **LANDED** | **Server registry** — shipped with N slots rather than the one this row asked for; the ceiling is `MAX_SERVERS = 16`. New `plex/servers.rs`: `ServerId(u16)`, `Server`, `Conn{scheme,…}`, a `CLIENTS` table + `CURRENT`. `install` registers slot 1; `client()`/`client_opt()` keep their signatures and now mean "the current server". `TOKEN_GEN` moves **into** `Client`. Zero call-site changes. Note `client()` is hot — `posters::poster_key` calls it three times per key per tile per frame, so use an atomic-pointer table, not an `RwLock`. | ½–1 d | Foundation |
| 2 | **Thread `ServerId` through the stored structs** — `PmsMovie`, `BrowseSection`, `Detail`, `PlayingItem`, `Person`, `Pslot`, `trail::Node`, `ResolveEnv`/`Plan`, `UpNext`/`QueueRow`. Every rk equality test becomes a pair. The rule is **capture at the spawn site**, never read the current server inside a worker (`ResolveEnv`'s doc is the template and gives the general form of it; the `browse.rs:576` citation this row gave does not survive — that line has moved and carries no such comment). Behaviour change: none. | 2–3 d | The mechanical diff |
| 3 | **Move the ~30 call sites onto `client_for(sid)`.** `posters.rs:452` becomes `client_for(slot.sid)?.fetch_built(&key)` — **token-free**, because the poster key already ends in `with_token(…)` and `get_bytes` would append a second one. Ship gate: byte-identical event log across `tests/run.py`. | 1 d | Correctness |
| 4 **LANDED** | **Probe + race.** `plex/probe.rs` retains the advertised HTTPS URI but suppresses plaintext for unmatched non-owned LAN connections (§2a), drops HTTP when `httpsRequired`, and ranks local→remote→relay. `auth.rs` races candidates within one server, verifies `machineIdentifier`, and activates the first VERIFIED answer this build can put a credential on (`Candidate::credential_eligible`, stamped once at synthesis from `CredentialPolicy` — issue #95: a verified plaintext answer no longer counts as reached in a store build), may re-point once to the best such answer, and persists only that winner. Servers remain serial with a 4 s gap; relay is a second phase whenever nothing eligible verified directly; a verified plaintext-only answer ends as `Reach::InsecureOnly` ("Not secure"), which outranks a `401`. | 1–1½ d | **The share becomes reachable** |
| 5 | **Persist the registry; boot from the hint.** `session.rs` gains `servers: Vec<ServerRec>` + `current_machine_id`, every field `#[serde(default)]`, legacy `ServerRef` still written for one release. A corrupt `servers` array must not fail the whole `Session` parse — that is a silent sign-out at every boot. No timestamps: this TV's wall clock is ~3 h skewed. | 1 d | Fast boot |
| 6 **LANDED** | **TLS control plane.** Shipped as `rust-modules/src/http.rs`: `Scheme::Http` keeps the raw `stream.rs` arm, while `Scheme::Https` uses `net.rs`/libcurl. The curl request surface now carries per-call deadlines, a bounded response sink, body-less `CUSTOMREQUEST` PUT, HTTP(S)-only redirect policy for the public QR fetch, and one fresh easy handle per call so no request state can survive into the next. Probe ranking is TLS-first, status remains distinct from reachability, and every PMS/account request conditionally carries the validated inherited locale as `X-Plex-Language`. | 1–1½ d | Any https-only share browses |
| 7 **LANDED** | **TLS media plane.** Shipped as `rust-modules/src/curlio.rs`: the second `dynlib!` table (seven `curl_multi_*`, device-probed PRESENT and inventory-confirmed on all 14 releases; `curl_multi_poll`/`curl_multi_wakeup` probed ABSENT and therefore banned — they first appear at 7.4.0, so binding them would have emptied the table on four of the nine gated releases), `AvioState`'s source enum, the `read_cb`/`seek_cb` dispatch, the preserved seek abort guard and the two extended abort-guard tests, all as this row asked. **One deviation, deliberate:** teardown is a **wake pipe** handed to `curl_multi_wait` as an application-owned extra fd, NOT `curl_multi` pumped from inside `read_cb`. The row's outcome — teardown collapses to "set the flag, join" — is preserved, and that is the reason: self-polling puts a 10–100 ms floor on every teardown, while a byte on a pipe wakes a blocked wait at once. The one gap the pipe cannot close is a thread already inside `curl_multi_perform` doing SYNCHRONOUS name resolution; the dev set reports `AsynchDNS`, and the designed fallback (our own `getaddrinfo` + `CURLOPT_RESOLVE`, hostname untouched so SNI and certificate identity survive) is written into `curlio`'s module doc and deliberately not built. With step 6 present, ordinary HTTPS browse/play now reaches this source; `nativejelly-servers` and `nativejelly-playurl` remain the isolation routes for device diagnosis. | 2–4 d | Any share plays |
| 8 **LANDED** | **N servers live** — the Sources list is a chip at the head of the Library's document with a one-level picker panel (§6; it was a toolbar chip with a two-level panel until 2026-09-05), `sourceTitle` is the row subtitle, and attribution stays in **text not artwork**. Profile activation only installs prepared identity and queues catalog work; hubs and sections use per-source workers/mailboxes, lifecycle generations reject stale landings after a repoint, and a dead share no longer blocks the SDL loop or blanks another source. A failed catalog request also queues a single-flight `/resources` re-probe for that exact granted machine, so a Wi-Fi/LAN transition can publish a newly reachable origin without copying the account owner's token into a managed profile or changing its grants. Continue Watching is merged by `lastViewedAt`. | 2–4 d | The product |
| 9 **LANDED, UNVERIFIABLE** | **Relay policy.** The relay clamps no bitrate: `maxVideoBitrate` is a literal on the re-encode branch only. (`TranscodeSpec` gained a `ceiling` field on 2026-08-23 for the USER's ladder — same mechanism, different input; the relay still names no rate.) Respecting relay's 2 Mbps means **forcing a transcode decision** in `build_stream` — a policy change, not a parameter. | ½–1 d | Correctness on relay |

**Shortest path to seeing the share on screen: 0 → 1 → 4**, plus enough of 2/3 to keep the caches
honest. Steps 6–7 are what make it robust for *any* share rather than this one.

**The cheap variant**, named honestly: if one **active** server at a time is acceptable (switch,
never merge), steps 2, 3 and most of 8 shrink to a picker that does a full identity-style reset on
every switch — roughly a third of the diff. What it costs: no merged Home or Continue Watching, and
switching throws away the other server's grid, scroll and focus every time. It still needs step 1,
because `OnceLock` cannot re-point at all.

## 6. How it appears in the UI — SUPERSEDED by the design

**The design team answered this brief on 2026-08-13 and changed three of its five deliverables.**
The canvas (`Shared Sources.dc.html`, project `3ec1f4af…`) is the source of truth — **open it before
building any of this**; what follows is only its shape, kept here so this doc does not point the
next implementer the wrong way. Where the two disagree, the canvas wins. In particular the earlier
draft of this section put the Sources list in the **account popover** and gave the **tab strip** a
per-source annotation, and both are wrong: it is a library-toolbar chip, and the strip carries
nothing new at any number of friends.

**Deliverable C is the one with code behind it** (§9): a shelf heading can already name its source,
and does so as a second text run on the same painter, absent rather than empty when there is none.

**With one source, none of it is drawn** — not a bare suffix, not an empty slot. The Sources row is
not built, the strip has three pills, the headings carry no annotation.

**People in content, machines in settings.** The handle (`friend`) on every browsing surface; the
machine name (`nas-home`) only in the Sources list and the failure read-out.

- **A — the Sources list is reached through the library pill strip's `MORE` pill**, not a row in
  the account popover. Zero or one eligible library draws no selector at all, for every profile,
  owned or borrowed; two or more draw the strip, with a `MORE` pill once the row overflows, and
  only `MORE` opens a 640-wide panel — issue #100/#165: a borrowed singleton no longer keeps a dead
  picker. The canvas gave it **two levels** switched by
  Browse / On Home pills at the panel top (the track menu's own swap); **the shipped panel has one**
  — it is the picker, and nothing else. The second level became its own route on 2026-09-05, when
  the switch stopped governing Home alone: *Favorite libraries*, which is also the
  only surface listing every GRANTED library, so a non-favourite has a way back. **As of phase 5b
  (2026-09-07) that is no longer one mechanism for both entry points**: the screen itself moved off
  the `static mut` `ui::onboard` module onto an owned `Screen` impl, `screens::onboard`'s
  `OnboardScreen`, mounted twice (spec §6.2) — first-run still arrives as its own page
  (`AppArg::Onboard`, the route this paragraph describes), but reached from Settings it is now a
  *page* of the Settings family (`SettingsPage::Favourites`) rather than a second value the app's
  page alphabet takes, so the
  once/sec heartbeat's `route=` field no longer reads `onboard` for the Settings-opened case — only
  for the first-run one. A picker that could
  turn into an editor would let a library be un-favourited from inside the list of favourites and
  then vanish out of it under the cursor. **Browse** is a picker — one tick, OK closes, scoped to
  the FAVOURITES of the type being browsed. **On Home** is a toggle — the word `On`/`Off` at the
  trailing edge, OK flips, the list stays open.
  Grouped by server: header = machine, accessory = person. The last favourite library uses `value_dim`;
  an unreachable server's whole group dims at .52, header included. "Check for shared libraries" sits last
  under a separator. Rejecting the popover also withdraws both of the flags this doc raised about
  `account_menu.rs`'s static arrays and its close-before-acting OK.
- **B — the tab strip carries NOTHING new.** A pill is a **type**, always bare; it grows by missing
  types (a friend sharing Music you do not own), never by people, so it is 447px constant at any
  number of friends. The width-map flag is withdrawn — the strip never sees an annotation.
- **C — source lives in the shelf heading**: `Recently Added in Film Club · friend`, one rung down,
  regular against bold, tertiary, after a middot at .45. **Continue Watching merges across pinned
  sources and carries no annotation at all** — a shelf drawn from three servers cannot be named by
  one of them. Nothing on the tile, ever. The hero needs nothing: it *is* the shelf's focused tile.
- **D — a dead source is absent from Home** (no shelf, no spinner) and its borrowed items leave
  Continue Watching. Its library section draws the shared failure read-out: `Can’t reach nas-home`,
  reason `Shared by friend · your own server is fine.`, one action `Try again`, its verdict on the
  same screen-space anchor as Home's and the sign-in failure's (`StatusOverlay::page`), with only
  the head of the document beside it — no sort/filter chips, no count, no
  A–Z rail. **The head is whichever form it would take on a healthy page**, which since issue #68
  (2026-09-06) is never a chip — there is none any more: `Layout::failed` builds the head with the
  same eligible-library rule `draw_document` uses, so a dead library that shares its type with
  another favourite draws the library pill strip beside the read-out. That is the useful answer
  anyway — the strip is how you leave the library that cannot be reached — but there is no "Source
  chip" left to qualify.
- **E — `Shared by friend`** as the last run on the detail hero's date/runtime line, plus an **Also
  available** button in the actions row when a second pinned source holds the film. **OK navigates**
  to that server's page rather than swapping the copy in place, which is also what settles the
  per-server resume position.
- **F — a first-run route** (new): after the profile picker, before Home, only when the roster holds
  more than one source. Two columns, own libraries `On` and a friend's `Off`, focus on *Start
  watching*, BACK skips. **LANDED — see §12, which also records the one place the OWNER's ruling
  overrides this canvas: the selection is per Plex Home PROFILE, not per install.**

**PINNING is the new concept.** Three orthogonal states: *granted* (plex.tv's answer), *pinned*
(the only control), *reachable* (a fact about now).

**It governed Home ALONE until 2026-09-05, and this paragraph said so.** The switch is now called
**Favorite libraries** and it governs every browsing surface: Home's shelves, **which type pills the
top strip draws at all** (`browse::tab_has_favorite` — a type whose last favourite is switched off
draws no pill), and the Library's own Sources picker (`browse::source_rows`). The identifiers did
not move with the words: `BrowseSection::pinned`, `HomePins`, `plex/pins.rs` and the persisted
`home_pins` key are all unchanged, deliberately — renaming the persisted key breaks ROLLBACK rather
than upgrade. What still comes from the GRANT and not from the setting: access itself, the grid,
sort, the A–Z rail, and Search, which stays grant-wide and only RANKS favourite-library hits first.
The grant decides what you can reach; the favourite decides what the app offers.

**Two divergences between the canvas and main, both because main moved while it was drawn**, neither
requiring the design to change: its toolbar frames include an `Unwatched` chip that `0d9a4f6f`
deleted (the toolbar is two chips today, so Source makes **three**), and its rejected-list reasons
from "the unwatched angle", which `23f28ce6` replaced with the white tick over a veil.

## 7. Open questions

1. **Playback of the share's content, end to end.** Untested. The sample item is h264 + **TrueHD**
   at 31 Mbit/s; TrueHD is not in the direct-play audio set, so this goes down the transcode path
   over a WAN link measured at 38.8 Mbit/s. Expect this, not direct play, to be the common case —
   and it argues for a remote-aware bitrate policy well before relay does (step 9).
2. ~~**The harness cannot grade any of this yet.**~~ **ANSWERED** (§9): `/tmp/nativejelly-servers`
   carries a JSON array of ADDITIONAL servers — host, port, an optional `"scheme"` (`http`, the
   default, or `https` — the only way to put a TLS origin through the registry without an account
   that has one), machineIdentifier and the token to trust
   them with — beside the unchanged `/tmp/nativejelly-token`, and `run.py` resolves the second token
   from `/api/v2/resources` so no new secret is stored. One limitation stands and is not a bug to
   fix: there is **no managed-user token for someone else's server**, so a case that PLAYS from a
   share plays as YOU there. `test_user` isolation stops at the account boundary.
3. **plex.direct DNS from inside the app's jail** (curl uses c-ares; the jail's resolv view differs
   from the ssh shell's). Prove by logging the resolved address on the first remote request.
4. **TLS on 256 KB stacks, concurrently** — `task::spawn_small`'s stack, with seven worker kinds
   each doing a handshake. Device-verify under a full Home + library scroll.
5. **Relay end to end** has never been observed by this codebase. Discovery now holds relay
   candidates for a second phase after every direct candidate settles, and the chosen tier feeds
   `plex::link_policy`; the 2 Mbps cap and port 8443 are still documentation, not measurement. It
   cannot be
   verified from here even deliberately: **this account's share advertises no relay connection at
   all** (§2), so there is nothing to dial. Confirming it needs a server that is genuinely
   relay-only — an owner behind CGNAT, or one who turns their port forward off for an afternoon.

## 8. Doc corrections this work turned up — and where they stand

All were confirmed in code. **All four are now fixed at the source**, which is the point of listing
them; they are kept here as a record of what the wrong text was costing, because that is the part a
re-read cannot recover.

- Root `CLAUDE.md` said `stream.rs` had "no chunked decoding". It has decoded chunked since
  `HttpStream`'s `chunked`/`chunk_left` and `hs_next_chunk`. **Fixed.** Left alone it made
  `stream.rs` read as less capable than it is, and sent work to `net.rs`/curl that the raw socket
  could already do.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` and `player/CLAUDE.md` described `ff.rs` as "the TV's own libavformat", dlopen'd
  by SONAME candidate list. FFmpeg is **bundled and pinned** (majors 63/63/61, `-plx` suffix, opened
  by absolute path out of `paths::app_dir()`). **Fixed in both** — and on 2026-08-13 also in the
  **Makefile itself**, whose `LIBS_REAL` comment still filed FFmpeg beside curl and ACB as "SONAME
  moves, 55→57→58→59→60", a hundred lines above the rules that build and stage the pinned copy. That
  is the wording that keeps "just use the TV's FFmpeg for https" coming back, when what we ship is
  configured `--disable-network` and cannot open a URL at all.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` claimed the dual-FFmpeg-header ABI gate (n3.3 + n4.0, "two ABI tables").
  **Fixed:** one header tree, one table, and the vendored trees are gone — `vendor/` holds nanosvg
  and nothing else, so anyone who went looking found nothing and had no way to tell which half of
  the sentence was wrong.
- The host suite is **424** tests as of 2026-08-14 — it was recorded as 284, then as 396 in this
  note's own first draft, which was already stale when it was written. **Do not trust any number in
  any document, including this one.** Re-derive:
  `cd rust-modules && cargo +nightly test --lib -- --list | grep -c ': test'`.

## 9. What has landed (2026-08-13 → 2026-08-23)

The host-testable foundation is now connected to the live sign-in and warm-boot paths. Discovery
races candidates within each server, keeps servers serial, restores the winning connection tier on
boot, and refreshes the persisted roster without letting a superseded sign-in/profile/sign-out flow
publish old credentials. Historical test totals below are snapshots; re-derive the current count.

**The data layer**

- **`plex/account.rs` — the roster DTOs widened** to `sourceTitle`, `ownerId`, `home`, `presence`,
  `publicAddressMatches`, `httpsRequired` and `Connection.IPv6`, with `includeIPv6=1` on the query.
  Every field is now null-tolerant — `sourceTitle` a real `Option`, the other strings through
  `de_str`, `connections` through `de_vec`, the flags through a new `de_bool`, the ids through
  `de_i64` — because `#[serde(default)]` covers an *absent* field and not a present `null`, and one
  strict field meeting one null fails the whole array and ends sign-in at "no server found".
  `Resource::local_connection()` (dead, zero callers) is deleted; `probe.rs` supersedes it.
- **`plex/servers.rs` — the registry**, keyed on `machineIdentifier`, replacing the `OnceLock`
  singleton whose host and port froze at the first `install`. `client()`/`client_opt()` keep their
  signatures and mean "the current server", so ~30 call sites outside `plex/` read unchanged;
  `client_for(id)`, `register`, `set_current` and `ServerId` are the additions. Why it is an
  **atomic-pointer table** rather than a lock, why every slot's `Client` is **leaked**, and why
  token generations come from a **process-global sequence** are all consequences of one fact —
  `client()` is a hot path (`posters::poster_key` calls it three times per key, per visible tile,
  per frame) — and the full account now lives where implementers will meet it, in
  **`rust-modules/src/plex/CLAUDE.md`**.
- **`plex/probe.rs` — the connection policy, pure.** No socket, no thread, no clock, so all of it is
  host-testable on Darwin. Builds and ranks candidate origins: for a non-owned unmatched local
  connection it retains only the advertised HTTPS URI and suppresses both advertised and synthesized
  plaintext; it suppresses every plain-HTTP candidate when the owner set `httpsRequired`, and ranks
  local → remote → relay. It also carries, as doc, the two rules
  a real prober must honour and this module cannot: verify `machineIdentifier` on the response before
  accepting a connection, and treat `401` as its own state rather than "unreachable".
- **The relay policy — `plex::link_policy`, plus `Client::set_link`/`link()` to carry the fact.**
  A relay is a ~2 Mbit/s tunnel, so a plan that ships the file's own bytes over one stalls mid-film
  with nothing on any surface saying why. The policy denies **direct play and the container remux**,
  leaving the re-encode — the only flavor whose query lets the server pick a rate. Denying the
  remux is the half that is easy to miss: it copies the codecs and deliberately sends no cap, so it
  is the same 31 Mbit/s one layer down. It is a **branch, and for the relay never also a parameter**
  — a cap is meaningless on direct play, and the server is the only party that knows the tunnel's
  real ceiling. (`TranscodeSpec` grew a `ceiling` field on 2026-08-23, spent by the user-chosen
  quality ladder through this same two-flag policy; nothing about the relay tier changed.) `route::build_stream` consults it beside the codec gates.
  **Unverified against a real relay, and not verifiable from this account** — see §7 question 5;
  what is asserted is the shape, not the 2 Mbps.

- **The old sign-in chooser kept to IPv4.** That guard prevented an undialable v6 origin from being
  persisted when `stream.rs` still built `sockaddr_in` by hand. Both control transports now resolve
  names and IPv6, and discovery persists only an origin whose `/identity` answer named the expected
  machine. The historical regression remains worth recording; the old chooser does not remain live.

**The screens and the harness**

- **A shelf heading can name its source** (deliverable C): `Recently Added in Film Club · friend`,
  a second run on the same painter so the annotation cannot detach from the title under the shelf's
  lift or snap fade, and **absent rather than empty** when there is no source — no gap, no dot, no
  draw call, which is what makes it free for the single-server install. `HubRow.source` is `""` at
  both construction sites, so nothing new is reachable until step 8 populates it. One visible change
  rode along: shelf headings moved from `TEXT_PRIMARY` to the shared `TEXT_HEADING` ink.
- **A failed browse page is a STATE** (`SecFetch { Loading, Ready, Failed }`), found while mapping
  this work but a bug on the user's OWN server: a failed first page armed the retry cooldown and
  nothing else, so `total` stayed `-1`, `loading_initial()` was `total < 0`, and the grid spun for
  the rest of the session with nothing on screen admitting it. An EMPTY answer is `Ready`, never
  `Failed`. Section discovery now has its own Loading/Empty/Failed state and Retry path.
- **The harness can hand the TV a second server** — `/tmp/nativejelly-servers`, a JSON array of
  additional servers beside the unchanged token file, deliberately **not** DIAG-exempt (it must
  suppress the who's-watching picker like the token file, or a headless run grades the wrong
  screen). Its own connection ranking does **not** copy the app's sign-in rule, for the reason §2(a)
  gives: public wins for a non-owned server, dotted quads beat hostnames, relay last.

Three tests are worth knowing about, because each was written after a mutation showed the suite
could not see the bug:

- The owned-server fixture carries **`publicAddressMatches: false`** — the value the live capture
  actually returns. With `true` there, deleting `&& !res.owned` from the drop rule passed the entire
  suite while, in the field, discarding **our own** `192.168.x.x` and offline play with it.
- An explicit `null` on every string and on `connections` itself is asserted to cost that field and
  never the roster — the second server in that fixture is a good one, and the test is really about
  it still arriving.
- The relay policy is graded from **both ends**: the pure answer per tier, and a server whose only
  advertised address is a relay, run through `probe::candidates` so that the ranking and the policy
  are pinned to the same `Location` vocabulary. An unknown link is asserted to restrict **nothing**
  for a freshly constructed/legacy client; discovery and session restore now publish the measured
  tier after each registration or re-point.

## 10. The section table goes multi-server, and gets its library pill strip (deliverable A)

Step 1's registry now has its first real consumer, and deliverable A of the design is drawn.

- **The section table addresses (SOURCE, section).** `BrowseSection` carries the source its row came
  from, and `BrowseSource` is the granted roster projected out of `plex::server_ids()` — the §3 table's
  verified collision (both servers have a section `1`) is what the address closes. Every fetch goes
  through `client_for(sid)` **captured at the spawn site**; nothing reads `client()` inside a worker.
- **It grows by APPEND while the roster is stable; grant removal uses the existing whole-store
  identity reset.** A page landing is blamed on a section INDEX, so compacting the table under an
  in-flight fetch would splice one library's items into another's store. New sources therefore
  append, while an exact active-id change supersedes every landing before rebuilding.
  Two generations now, each with a crisp job: `SECTIONS_GEN` (shape — bumped by an append, what the
  label caches key on) and `EPOCH` (identity — bumped by `reset` alone, what index-blamed landings
  gate on, so one source's append cannot discard another's answer).
- **Every source is discovered off the main thread.** Home, Library, Search and Onboard drive the
  same worker/mailbox pump — sections, then the server's own `friendlyName`, then a `size=0` count
  probe per library — with a 10 s per-source backoff. Entering Library only selects a type and view
  state; it performs no HTTP. A dead share becomes a recoverable failed source without parking SDL.
- **Pinning** is the design's one control and, since 2026-09-05, governs the whole app rather than
  Home alone (above): your HOUSEHOLD's libraries start favourite, a friend's start favourite only
  if the household has no library of that type, and the last favourite cannot be turned off.
  `pinned_libraries()` is its read side. The household and not the account, because plex.tv grades
  a Plex Home managed profile's own family server `owned:false` — read on ownership, such a profile
  had nothing of its own, no type of its own, and therefore every library it could see starting
  favourite, a stranger's included.
- **The tab strip's vocabulary is permanent; its LENGTH is not.** A library pill names a type, never
  a discovered row, so it survives reset and failed/delayed discovery — but a type with no favourite
  library draws no pill at all, so the row is `Home … Search` with two to four stops in between.
  Store a `Pill`, never a `usize`. The
  selected type resolves to the library this profile last chose, else household-first, then to the
  first usable outside section; the Source panel
  selects alternatives.
- **The library pill strip and its Sources panel** are `screens/library/toolbar.rs` (the strip) and
  `screens/library/mod.rs` (the panel); the row model is pure and host-tested. The
  panel had two levels (`Browse` ⟷ `On Home`) until 2026-09-05 and is now a PICKER and nothing else
  — one level, one tick, no words. The editor was its own route (*Favorite libraries*,
  `ui::onboard`) until phase 5b (2026-09-07); reached from Settings it is now a PAGE of the
  Settings family (`SettingsPage::Favourites`, hosting `screens::onboard`'s owned `OnboardScreen`)
  rather than a second value the page alphabet takes — deliverable A above has the mechanism, and
  first-run alone still arrives as `AppArg::Onboard`. Either way it remains the one surface listing
  every GRANTED library, so a non-favourite has a way back. The pill strip itself now heads the
  Library's document rather than leading a toolbar. `TableView` gained the two things it was missing for it: a drawn `Section::accessory`
  (declared but never painted before) and `Section::dim`.
- **The roster's own facts** (machine name, owner handle, owned) live beside the registry as
  `plex::ServerFacts`, merged rather than replaced so plex.tv and a server naming itself over `GET /`
  can land in either order. `/tmp/nativejelly-servers` gained a `handle` field, and `run.py` fills it
  from the resource's `sourceTitle`, so a two-source run is gradeable headlessly.

- **The temporary current-server seam is retired.** Stored rows carry `ServerId`, request paths
  resolve through `client_for(sid)`, and Home merges per-source shelves without moving the session's
  primary. Registry/profile replacement is an exact active-id boundary: removed shares disappear
  from Browse, Search and Home even when another share replaces them at the same count.

**Not verified on device.** Host tests and the ARM cross-build grade the identity, race, sparse
roster and persistence rules; the screens and real legacy TLS backend still need the §9 TV recipe.

**Current next step.** Direct candidates now race with absolute tier-specific deadlines, relay is a
second phase, the coordinator activates the first verified origin and may re-point once to the final
best score, and the winning origin/tier are persisted. The remaining work is device evidence and
the separately ruled UI/packaging follow-ups, not a sequential `activate_best` implementation.

## 11. Watch state follows the TITLE (2026-08-21)

**The one place the app deliberately breaks per-server semantics.** Everything else in this document
is built on view state being per-server, and it still is on the wire: two copies of one film on two
servers are two items with two `viewCount`s and two `viewOffset`s, and §1's identity rule (every
item-shaped integer is server-local and dense from 1) is exactly why they cannot be conflated. But
"I have watched this" is a claim about a **title**, not about a file on a host — so a Mark as
Watched now **fans out** to every registered source that holds the same item.

It lives in `rust-modules/src/viewstate.rs`, which was already the single owner of view-state
writes, and it reuses the resolve "Also available" was built on (`Client::find_by_guid`, one query
per source, off the SDL thread).

- **The identity is the `guid` (`plex://movie/…`), never the `ratingKey`.** §1 is not academic here:
  both servers in this household hold a `ratingKey` 4, so a fan-out matched on the key marks a
  different film watched on the other machine — confidently, and with a 200 back.
- **No resume position is ever COPIED between servers. Only the watched flag travels.** This is the
  subtle half, and it is the half `screens/alt_sources.rs` reasons out: an offset is about a file you are
  streaming from one host, which is also why that panel NAVIGATES to the other copy rather than
  swapping it under you. `unscrobble` is fanned out too — it is the other end of one control, and
  clearing the claim is still a claim about the title — but no `viewOffset` is read or pushed
  anywhere. **The consequence that phrasing hides, stated plainly:** `/:/unscrobble` clears
  `viewCount` *and* `viewOffset`, so marking a title unwatched DISCARDS the other copies' resume
  points as well — exactly what it does to the copy you pressed. Watched and unwatched are therefore
  not symmetric in cost: one adds a fact, the other throws two away, on every source holding the
  title.
- **Remove from Continue Watching does NOT fan out.** The deck is a per-server surface; taking a
  friend's item off *your* deck is not what that row promises.
- **Resolved at WRITE time, on the worker.** Not off a detail page's earlier cross-source resolve:
  the press can come from a Home / Library / Search card menu where none has ever run. A press that
  carries a guid (the detail hero, which holds the guid OF the item it is mounted on) uses it; every
  other press has one looked up from its own `(server, ratingKey)`, which costs one extra GET on a
  thread that is not drawing anything.
- **Best-effort per source, unconditional, and never fatal.** One asleep share costs one log line and
  cannot fail or retry the write the user actually pressed. There is no setting for propagation;
  Settings only controls which granted libraries contribute to Home. A **one-source install pays
  nothing**: the source count is checked
  before the guid lookup, so there is no query and no log line.
- **The other copies flip on screen a round trip later, not on the press frame.** The optimistic edit
  can only reach the `(sid, rk)` in hand, because the other keys are what the resolve *discovers*;
  the fan-out reports them and the landing applies the same local edit to each, with the hub refetch
  that already follows every write reconciling the rest.

**Not verified on device.** The host suite grades the identity rule (which copies a fan-out writes,
that the pressed copy is not written twice, that a deck removal does not propagate) and the landing's
local edit; the two-server round trip itself needs a television and both servers awake.

## 12. The Home selection, per PROFILE — deliverable F (2026-08-21)

The canvas's first-run route was built in `ui/onboard.rs` (phase 5b, 2026-09-07, moved it to
`screens/onboard.rs` as the owned `OnboardScreen` described in deliverable A above — the route
itself, and everything below about what it shows and why, is unchanged), and building it settled
the question the canvas could not, because it was drawn before the owner ruled on it:

> *"Servers are configured on a PC or phone. On the television we only CHOOSE from the available
> servers. And it is separate for each profile."*

Three consequences, all of which the code now states:

**There is no add-a-server-by-address on the television, and there will not be.** The list is the
plex.tv grant — the existing registry — and nothing else. This is a product decision, not a
transport limitation: HTTPS control/media are supported in stable builds; plaintext
hostname/IPv4/IPv6 origins remain available only in explicit developer-trigger lab builds, apart
from the consented home-network exception (`plex::grant`), which admits one verified numeric
private origin per server and never a name.

**The selection is keyed by PROFILE.** `Session::pinned: Vec<PinnedLib>` hung off the `Session`,
which is one per install — so a household could hold exactly one opinion about a friend's films,
and switching profile left the previous person's shelves on the front door. It is now
`Session::home_pins: Vec<HomePins>`, keyed by the Plex Home user's **`uuid`** (empty = the account
owner with no Home selection), which is the same shape and the same reasoning `recent_searches`
beside it already carries. A switch needs no code of its own to honour it: `install_pms` calls
`browse::reset`, discovery re-runs, and the re-resolve reads the new profile's record.

**`HomePins` records BOTH sides of the answer** — `on` and `off`, not one list of pins. A single
list cannot tell *turned off* from *not answered about*, and libraries arrive over time: a share
whose server was slow, a library the owner created last week. One that lands after the question was
put must fall on its own DEFAULT, not silently Off because it was absent from a list written before
it existed. That is also what makes the canvas's "a share arriving later does not reopen this
screen" honest rather than merely quiet.

The rules are `plex::pins` — pure, no store, host-graded: the HOUSEHOLD default, the recorded
answer, the "more than one source, once per profile" gate, and a **never-empty floor** (a recorded
selection CAN be emptied without any toggle — pin only a friend's library, then lose the friend
from the roster). Only the rows a viewer ANSWERED are recorded (`pins::answers`): a default
nobody chose keeps re-deriving, which is what lets a Home roster landing after the first-run screen
correct a classification it arrived too late to inform, without touching an answer anybody gave.
Which rows those are is carried BY the commit — `BrowseCmd::ApplyPins` holds the rows a press
actually MOVED (`screens::onboard`'s `touched`, recorded at the toggle), not the rows the editor
showed and not a comparison of any kind. The store inferred it from "the row disagrees with the
live pin" and the screen then inferred it from "the draft disagrees with `entry_pins`"; both drop
an answer the world drifted onto, one layer apart, which is why the provenance is written down
where it happens. And because only the answered rows are recorded, a commit that produced a record
ends by reconciling the whole table against the optimistic in-memory record (the same reconcile a
reclassification runs), without claiming that what is displayed was saved. The queued read-merge-write
runs later, tracked by `PinWrite`/`pending_pins`; a pending or failed write keeps the local answer.
A commit REFUSED before queuing — no `client_id` yet — produces no record and is not reconciled at
all: the record still standing is the one the commit meant to replace, so resolving against it would
put the viewer's answer back the way it was. The answer stands in memory for the run instead.
An admission refusal from `queue_update_ticket` would likewise produce no record; that is its
queueing contract, not `session::update`'s. The current implementation always returns `Ok`, retaining
writes for retry when the worker queue cannot admit them. `browse.rs` is the plumbing
around them, and a selection PERSISTS: every flip was in-memory before 2026-08-21, so a selection
made in the Sources panel was gone by the next boot and the default came back, which reads as the
switch not working. Since 2026-09-04 the write
is `browse::apply_pins`, once, when the Home editor's `Done`/`Start watching` commits its draft — a
flip edits the in-memory draft and nothing is written until then (`toggle_pin`, the old per-press
write, is a test-only fixture now).

### Where the implementation reinterprets the canvas

Four places, all recorded so the next reader does not "fix" them back:

1. **Per profile.** The canvas predates the ruling and says nothing about profiles. The owner wins.
2. **Your own server's group header carries no accessory.** The canvas gives it `"This account"`;
   the shipped Sources panel draws nothing, on its own stated rule that an empty handle is *the
   absence of an owner rather than an anonymous one*. The route and the panel must agree, and they
   do — that rule is the one that stays.
3. **An account with no server of its HOUSEHOLD'S gets every library On.** The canvas's "a friend's
   arrives Off" has no answer for such an account; taken literally it opens the app on nothing.
   With nothing of the household's to prefer, a borrowed library is simply a library. The
   household and not the account, and the distinction is the whole managed-profile fix: plex.tv
   answers a Plex Home managed profile `owned:false` about the family server, so read on ownership
   this exemption was satisfied by *every* managed and Guest profile in existence — which is how a
   genuine friend's share came up favourite on the family's Home beside the family's own.
4. **Focus opens on *Start watching*.** The canvas says so twice in prose and draws it that way —
   but a stale comment in its own `renderVals` claims focus opens on row index 2, "the first shared
   library". The prose and the artwork agree with each other, so the comment is the odd one out.

### The screen, and how to look at it

`screens/onboard.rs` (`ui/onboard.rs` before phase 5b, 2026-09-07) mounts `appkit::source_list` — the SAME row-model builder the Library toolbar's Sources
panel uses, extracted out of `ui/library.rs` for exactly this reason. It differs by two arguments,
not by a second builder: every library rather than the browsed type's (`browse::all_source_rows` —
there is no tab bar here to be scoped to), and no *Check for shared libraries* tail.

Its outer geometry is the shared `ui::route_screen::RouteLayout`: the same measured narrative
column, section-label anchor, content column and bottom action slot used by Settings, Privacy and
Legal. The source picker therefore owns rows only; it no longer carries its own route top, list x
or action coordinates.

**`/tmp/nativejelly-firstrun` forces the route.** A screen asked once per profile is otherwise
unreachable the moment you have answered it, and the two-source roster it needs comes from
`/tmp/nativejelly-servers`, which marks the boot automated — and an automated boot is exempt from the
question, exactly as it is from the who's-watching picker. Both halves are why looking at this
screen headlessly needs a trigger of its own.

One fix fell out of building it and applies to the Sources PANEL too: the counts and the machine
names land without changing the section table's SHAPE, and both surfaces were keyed on
`sections_gen()` — so rows read "Films" long after "26 films" had arrived and an unnamed group drew
no header at all. Both now watch `browse::source_list_gen()`, the shape plus the facts the rows
state.

### How the answer actually reaches Home — the join the section table cannot make

Found in review, and it is the failure that would have made the whole screen look ornamental: **the
answer has to govern Home before the friend's section worker has landed.**

`pms::feeds_home`'s standing rule is that *a library nobody has discovered is undecided, not
unpinned* — §6's own bootstrap, and correct, because the pin is a decision about libraries and you
cannot have decided against one that has never appeared. That was harmless while every granted
library defaulted On. It stops being harmless the moment a friend's library defaults **Off**,
because discovery is asynchronous: Home can fetch a source's shelves before that source's section
worker lands. The discovery pump runs from Home, Library, Search and first-run screens and never
from Player. During that interval the share sits in the roster with **no row
in the section table**, "undecided" applied, and a friend's shelves went back on the front door of
somebody who had turned them off the night before — including the person who simply pressed *Start
watching* on the defaults.

Two halves close it, both in `browse.rs`, and both keyed on the machine id because that is the only
name a record has:

- **`RECORDED`** — the current profile's persisted answer, kept in memory from the read
  `resolve_pins` already makes, and joined into `library_pins()` for every roster source the section
  table does NOT hold. The record is on disk keyed by machine; that is exactly the join that was
  missing. It is a snapshot rather than a per-call read because `library_pins` is reached from
  Home's own pump, and `session.rs` forbids a per-frame file read.
- **`pins::carry_forward`** — a record is written from the section table, and `set_pins_for`
  replaces a profile's entry wholesale, so one switch flipped on a boot the share missed would
  otherwise have erased the share's answer and let the default back in. The merge grain is
  the MACHINE: a server the table holds has just been answered about in full (a library it has since
  lost is correctly dropped); one it does not hold has not been answered about at all.

Both are graded on the host, with the negative case checked — `browse`'s
`a_recorded_answer_reaches_home_before_that_servers_sections_do` and
`a_flip_made_while_a_share_is_absent_does_not_erase_its_answer` both fail if either half is removed.

A third, smaller ordering bug went with them: the stored-session boot called `install_pms` — whose
section fetch resolves the Home selection — **before** `session::set_current`, so that resolve ran
against the owner's record whoever was signed in. The switch path (`auth::take_ready`) already had
the two the right way round; the boot path now matches it.

## 13. Who gets the credit — the one "Shared by …" rule (2026-09-03)

**Reported:** *"Shared by Gleb"* appeared on the user's **own** server as well as on an actually
shared one. It was not a display bug. The app was drawing plex.tv's raw `sourceTitle` wherever it
was non-empty, and there is a perfectly ordinary session in which plex.tv puts the account holder's
own handle on the household's own server: a **Plex Home managed profile**.

### What plex.tv gives us (measured 2026-09-03, dev account, placeholders per the table in the header)

`GET /api/v2/resources` answers **about the identity that asks**, and a profile switch re-asks it
with the switched user's token (`auth::switch_thread`). So the same machine is described two ways:

| asked as | `owned` | `sourceTitle` | `ownerId` | `home` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the account holder, about their own server | `true` | `null` | `null` | `false` |
| the account holder, about a friend's share | `false` | `<handle>` | the friend's account id | `false` |
| a managed Home profile, about the household's server | `false` | the admin's handle | the admin's account id | — |

The first two rows are measured on this account. The third is the reported symptom read back into
the wire shape: it is what makes `owned` alone insufficient, and it is why `sourceTitle` alone is
worse than useless — it is *actively* the wrong answer, naming the person watching.

Two further measurements decide how the household is identified:

* **`/api/v2/home/users` returns each member's plex.tv `id`, and the admin row's `id` is exactly the
  `id` `/api/v2/user` reports for the account.** So `Resource.ownerId` and `HomeUser.id` are one id
  space and "does this server's owner live in this house" is an integer comparison — not a
  comparison of two differently-sourced display names. (It has to be: a managed user's `username`
  is `null`, and this account's `title`/`friendlyName` differ from its `username`.)
* **`home` is community-tier and is consulted ONLY when the id comparison cannot answer.**
  python-plexapi documents it as *"home (bool): Unknown"*. One reading is refuted here — this
  account is a Plex Home admin with `homeSize` 3, and both its grants (owned server, friend's
  share) come back `home:false`, so it is not "the owner has a Plex Home" — but the reading we want,
  *"this grant is a Home grant"*, has never been observed **true** by anybody in this project. So it
  is subordinate: `is_household` looks at `home` only when the household cannot be enumerated at
  all (a roster from a file written before `HomeUserRef::id`, or a sign-in whose
  `/api/v2/home/users` has not landed). An undocumented flag must not be able to take a credit away
  from a friend's share on the strength of its name — that is the one way this change could regress
  a case that works today.

### The rule

> **"Shared by …" credits a person OUTSIDE this household, and nobody else.** A server is credited
> only when plex.tv says all three: `owned:false`; the owner is not one of us (`ownerId` is not a
> member of the signed-in Plex Home — or, when the Home cannot be enumerated at all, `home:false`);
> and `sourceTitle` names them.

Everything else draws nothing at all: our own server, the household's server whichever profile is
watching, and a share whose owner plex.tv has not named. **Absence is the safe direction**, and the
rule is written to fall that way — a late credit costs one quiet line of attribution, a wrong one
is a false statement about who owns what, drawn on the hero, the detail facts row, the Library
read-out, the search results and the "Also available" rows at once.

A second server owned by *another member of the same Plex Home* is not credited either. That is a
decision, not a side effect: a Plex Home is one household on one subscription, "Shared by" means
somebody outside it lent you their library, and one rule that says *inside the house nobody is a
guest* is worth more than a second rule for a case nobody here can measure.

### Where it lives

`plex::servers::owner_credit` is the rule; `plex::servers::Grant` is its input and
`account::Resource::grant` the only place a wire row becomes one. `plex::session::Session::
household_ids` supplies the house: **the Plex Home roster's ids and nothing else**, `0` filtered
because it is the "no id" value on both sides. That list's contents are load-bearing rather than a
convenience — the rule falls back to `home` exactly when it is empty, so emptiness has to mean *the
roster could not answer*, and nothing that cannot decide a case may be in it. The watching profile's
own `UserRef::id` was, briefly, and it broke precisely the sessions the fallback exists for: an
upgraded managed session has a roster of legacy `0`s and a real `user.id` from an old `/switch`, so
the list came back non-empty, `home` was silenced, and the one id that mattered (the admin's) had
been filtered away. `auth` calls it at every point a `/api/v2/resources`
row becomes something persisted or published — discovery, the early per-candidate publication, the
profile switch and the roster refresh — through the single `auth::credit_of`, so
`session::SourceRef::shared_by` and therefore `plex::ServerFacts::handle` hold **the credit and
never a raw `sourceTitle`**. `plex::servers::describe` additionally enforces the half it can always
see for itself (`owned` ⇒ nobody is credited), and publishes the credit AUTHORITATIVELY, which is
what lets a re-derived roster take a wrong name back off. It does not repair a stored entry by
itself: for the managed-profile case the persisted row still says `owned:false`, so the correction
has to come from the ingest re-grading it — see "What is NOT fixed" below.

**Nothing downstream decides who is CREDITED.** All seven presentations take
`ServerFacts::handle` and nothing else; what differs between them is only the wording around it.
Two say the whole phrase through `ui::fmt::shared_by`, which is words and not policy — the Home
hero's meta run and the detail page's facts row. The Library read-out, the Sources panel and
Search's owner annotation draw the bare handle in their own sentence. The "Also available" rows
carry it as `AltCopy::owner`, naming a row's source rather than captioning an item. And the
first-run onboarding copy (`screens::onboard`'s `OnboardScreen::body_copy` method — a free function
of the same name, `ui::onboard::body_copy`, before phase 5b — "…has shared a library with you") lists the
people from `browse::source_groups`, i.e. the same field one projection further out. Adding a screen
means reading that field; it does not mean re-deciding this.

**Six things about the plumbing are load-bearing and were all broken in the first cut**, found over
five review rounds, each with a regression test that fails without it. Five of them are one shape,
and it is worth naming because it is the whole cost of this change:

> **The credit is a DECISION that can be re-graded, and it was being COPIED into five caches, each
> of which had a rule for acquiring it and none for following it back down.**

So the rule to apply to any new consumer is: **derive it at use, or regrade it at the boundary
where it enters your cache.** Never take a copy and trust it.

**`plex::servers` publishes TWO epochs**, and the split is what makes the rest of it correct.
`ROSTER_GEN` still means *the set of servers changed* — the stores that discard in-flight work read
it, and a re-describe must not look like that to them. `FACTS_GEN` means *what we SAY about a
server changed* and moves on every `describe`. A single widened counter was tried first and was
wrong in both directions at once: it told `search`, `person` and the cross-source resolve that their
requests were stale when they were not, and folding it into `pms::roster_key` still left the gap
where registration bumps the counter BEFORE the describe that follows it, so a rebuild racing that
gap would cache the old credit under the new key and never revisit.

Then, per cache:

- **`describe` REPLACES the credit and merges only the machine name**
  (`an_authoritative_describe_can_take_a_credit_away_again`). An empty credit is the positive answer
  *nobody*, so it has to be able to take a previously published name off. While it merged, the
  correction below was persisted faithfully and then thrown away at boot: `install_roster`
  republished the roster as `describe(…, "", owned=false)`, which was a no-op, and the registry kept
  the wrong name for the life of the process. `describe_name` — the describer that knows only a name
  — carries the credit through instead of spelling an absence it cannot vouch for.
- **`browse::sync_roster` FOLLOWS the credit** rather than filling it once
  (`a_source_follows_a_corrected_credit_but_not_a_renamed_machine`). That per-source cache copied
  the handle only while its own copy was empty, so the Library read-out and the Sources panel could
  never lose or change a caption whatever the registry later learned. `owned` silently inherited the
  same gate, against its own comment. The machine NAME keeps its fill-only behaviour, deliberately:
  it is the one field there that a rename would churn under an open panel.
- **`pms::sync_roster` RE-STAMPS the shelves Home has already built**
  (`a_corrected_credit_restamps_the_shelves_home_already_built`). `merge` copies `Src::handle` onto
  every `HubRow` and hero row, and the re-merge only ran when a source had been DROPPED — so a
  re-graded credit changed nothing on screen until the next successful hub fetch, which an offline
  source never has: "keep the last good shelves" would have preserved the wrong attribution
  indefinitely. Its fingerprint reads both epochs now, as two atomics rather than three `u32`s
  crushed into one `u64`.
- **`metadata::Detail::source` is a METHOD, not a field** (`a_mounted_detail_page_follows_a_corrected_credit`).
  It was a `String` captured at fetch time, and the reasoning for storing it — the page outlives the
  fetch, the current server can move under it — is answered by `Detail::sid`, which names the server
  the item came FROM. With the id in hand the credit can be re-asked, and it has to be: nothing
  invalidates a mounted detail page, so a roster refresh corrected every other surface and left the
  hero's facts row saying the old thing until the user navigated away; and a detail fetch dispatched
  before the correction lands after it, past every epoch that would have caught it.
- **"Also available" RE-STAMPS rather than invalidating**
  (`a_re_described_source_restamps_the_credit_on_an_open_page`). `metadata::pump_alt_sources`
  answered a facts change the way it answers a roster change — invalidate the pending resolve and
  prune — which retains the installed copies untouched and restarts nothing, so the row named the
  person watching until the page was remounted. A re-graded credit says nothing about which servers
  hold the item, so the copies are kept and only their `owner` is re-read. Two riders, both found
  the round after: `install` regrades the incoming list as well, because a resolve dispatched before
  the correction lands after it and no epoch downstream looks again; and an OPEN panel is rebuilt,
  because the surface materialises its `TableView` once and `draw` renders that snapshot — so the rows
  keep their old text *and their old order* otherwise, and the order is not cosmetic, `owner` is the
  own-before-a-friend's tiebreak. The one place `AltCopy::owner` is decided is `metadata::alt_regrade`,
  applied at both boundaries, and skipped whole while the `/tmp/nativejelly-shared` stand-in owns the
  list (its entire purpose is to fabricate a borrowed copy on a slot the registry calls ours).

### What is NOT fixed, and is worth knowing

- **An empty credit means three different things** — our own server, the household's, and an
  external share plex.tv did not name — and two places still read that emptiness as *ours*:
  `pms::roster` groups Home's shelves by it, and `metadata::alt_copies` turns it into the
  "This account" row. For the household server that is now the right answer; for an unnamed external
  share it is wrong, and it was wrong before this change too (`ServerFacts::owned` has always
  documented that a share with no `sourceTitle` is still a share). This paragraph used to say the
  proper fix meant a three-state `Owned | Household | External` relation *carried* on `ServerFacts`
  and `SourceRef`, and named the blocker: the evidence that would grade a stored entry was never
  written down. **That blocker is gone.** `GrantEvidence` — `owned`, `home`, `ownerId` — now rides
  `ServerFacts`, `SourceRef` and `CandidateActivation`, and the three states are simply *derived*
  from it: `owned` is Owned, else `is_household` is Household, else External. A stored relation
  would add nothing a `match` on those three fields does not already give, and it would go stale
  the moment the Home roster changed under it, which is precisely why the verdict is derived and
  only the evidence is kept. What the pins and the tab destination read is that derivation
  (`BrowseSource::household`), and `owned` has stopped meaning "prefer this" on both of them. So
  what is left here is genuinely only the two empty-credit READERS above — a scoped follow-up whose
  cost is teaching those two surfaces the third state, not a data-model change — and it stays a
  follow-up because it changes what "This account" says on a user-facing row, which nobody has
  asked for. `screens::alt_sources_tests`'
  `an_unnamed_external_share_is_drawn_like_the_household_and_that_is_the_open_bug` pins the current
  behaviour so the follow-up has a red test waiting for it.
- **A session file written by an earlier build** has the raw handle already persisted in
  `SourceRef::shared_by`. It is corrected the first time the roster is re-derived — a sign-in, a
  `refresh_roster` (every boot, for the account owner) or any profile switch that is not the
  no-network "same profile" fast path — because `refreshed_sources` now *assigns* the credit rather
  than merging it, and `describe` now publishes that assignment. There is no offline migration for
  a file that old, and there cannot be a good one: the evidence that would grade a stored entry
  (`ownerId`, `home`) was not written down at the time, and nothing offline can reconstruct it.
  **New records do carry it** — `SourceRef` and `CandidateActivation` persist all three fields,
  `#[serde(default)]`, so the gap is genuinely confined to sessions written before they existed.
  Such a session deserializes to `owned:false, home:false, ownerId:0`, which `is_household` grades
  as an outsider's until the first online roster re-derive corrects it — the safe direction, and
  the same one every other unknown here falls in.
- **The `/tmp/nativejelly-servers` dev trigger still derives `owned` as `handle.is_empty()`**
  (`app.rs`), which is the derivation `ServerFacts::owned` documents as wrong. It is left alone
  because there the operator states the handle by hand and means it; but it cannot express an
  unnamed share or a household server, so it is an exception to the rule above rather than an
  instance of it.
- **The managed-profile row of the wire table is still unmeasured.** Obtaining it needs
  `POST /api/v2/home/users/{uuid}/switch`, which mints a credential; nobody has run it for this.
  Until somebody does, `home:true` has never been *seen*, which is precisely why the rule leans on
  `ownerId` and treats `home` as a fallback.
