# Backdrop blur: baseline graph and HWCNT measurement

This note describes the `backdrop-blur` branch before the direct-render experiment. It is the
baseline against which that experiment must be compared; none of the profiling changes below
alter the release render path. Development timing and counter runs use separate triggers.

## Current render graph

The renderer is immediate-mode. The opaque UI page is drawn into framebuffer 0 first. The first
glass surface then calls `gfx::draw_blur_backdrop`, which may refresh the one shared cached blur
chain before drawing that surface.

```text
framebuffer 0: normal full-resolution UI (1920x1080 authored and drawable on the target)
    |
    | glCopyTexSubImage2D: aligned requested region only, copied into (0,0)
    v
grab texture: RGBA, full drawable allocation 1920x1080, no FBO
    |
    | reduction 1: fs_img, bilinear exact 2x, clear + region viewport
    v
mid texture/FBO: RGBA 960x540 allocation, live viewport rw/2 x rh/2
    |
    | reduction 2: fs_img, bilinear exact 2x, clear + region viewport
    v
a texture/FBO: RGBA 480x270 allocation, live viewport rw/4 x rh/4
    |
    | Kawase 1: fs_blur, offset 1.5 quarter-resolution texels
    v
b texture/FBO: RGBA 480x270 allocation, live viewport rw/4 x rh/4
    |
    | Kawase 2: fs_blur, offset 3.5 quarter-resolution texels
    v
a texture/FBO
    |
    | up-filter: fs_blur, offset 1.25 half-resolution texels
    v
mid texture/FBO: final cached blurred snapshot at half axis resolution
    |
    | fs_glass: one full-resolution panel quad, including refraction/rim/dither
    v
framebuffer 0
    |
    | fs_src frost gradient, then widget foreground (text/icons/rows)
    v
framebuffer 0 -> swap
```

The two reductions use `fs_img`, not `fs_blur`; the Kawase and up-filter passes use `fs_blur`.
There is no separate full-resolution FBO for the UI. `grab` is a full-size texture populated from
framebuffer 0, and all allocated targets are reused for the process lifetime. Region limiting is
implemented with smaller lower-left viewports and UV windows; it does not reallocate targets.

The twelve phases this note is about are `profile.empty`, `frame.ui`, `main.ui`, `blur.copy`,
`blur.reduce1`, `blur.reduce2`, `blur.tap1`, `blur.tap2`, `blur.up`, `glass.composite`,
`glass.frost` and `glass.foreground`. They are **not the whole set** — the rest are per-section
phases on Home and the detail page, and the count here has rotted twice, so take it from
`ui::profile::PHASES`, which is the authority. A
trigger naming something outside that list is now refused with the valid names, rather than arming
a profiler that silently never matches. `profile.empty` issues no GL work and measures the
per-query floor, which is not zero on this driver and must be quoted beside every result.

## Region and coordinate rules

Each panel's resting bounds are expanded by `BLUR_MARGIN = 88` authored pixels: `BLUR_REACH = 68`
plus the maximum 20-pixel popover entry slide. `BLUR_REACH` itself is 38 pixels of maximum lens
displacement plus approximately 24.5 pixels of filter support, rounded up. Cached containment tests
need only the 68-pixel sampling reach because the 20-pixel slack exists to keep the entry animation
inside the first capture.

Every drawn glass surface contributes its expanded bounds to `BLUR_WANT_CUR`. At frame end that
union becomes `BLUR_WANT_PREV`; the next frame's first refresh unions the previous complete set
with the current caller. Adjacent surfaces therefore converge to one capture, while far-apart
surfaces enlarge the rectangle through the space between them.

The authored union is mapped to drawable pixels, rounded outward and aligned to four pixels so two
integer halvings remain registered. `glCopyTexSubImage2D` flips the authored top-origin Y into GL's
bottom-origin window Y. Each FBO pass flips storage orientation once through `vs_img`; the five-pass
chain ends top-down (`bottom_up == false`).

`fs_glass` maps a panel rect into the live subregion of the half-resolution `mid` texture. Its lens
distance remains authored pixels. `u_uvpx = live_texture_span / authored_region_size`, with the V
sign changed only when pass parity leaves the target bottom-up, converts the 38-pixel displacement
to the correct cropped-texture UV offset.

## Cache and refresh policy

Popover panels stopped using the chain on 2026-09-19 (they stand on the latched underlay field,
`widgets::panel_ground`); the cached popover preset `Glass::CACHED`, which reused the blurred `mid`
texture until explicit page invalidation or a region containment miss, went with them.
`Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP` (the chrome) keeps drawing the glass material
every presented UI frame and invalidates a dirty backdrop on every changed successful present.
The modal dim is a page-drawn scrim rather than an input transform on the source render. Skipped
idle-loop iterations do not advance that clock. The Account panel's exact height depends on the
measured row set.

## Measurement modes, and what each one can actually measure

Both modes were run on the dev television (Mali-T820 MP2 r1p0, DDK r12p0, webOS 4.5) on
2026-08-19. Everything below is measured, not predicted, and it revises what the first draft of
this note assumed.

### The timer-query path works, with one hard structural limit

`GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query` **is** advertised by this driver, with all six entry points and
`GL_QUERY_COUNTER_BITS_EXT = 64`. The extension string and the entry points are present in
`/usr/lib/libmali.so.0.1`; the app resolves them and collects results with no disjoint intervals
across thousands of samples. Put one exact phase name in `/tmp/nativejelly-profile` (empty selects
`frame.ui`) and retrieve `/tmp/nativejelly-gputime.jsonl`:

```sh
make fetch-profile
tools/analyze-gputime.py pkg/nativejelly-gputime.jsonl --phase blur.up --discard 60
```

**The limit: it can only see work rendered into an FBO, never work rendered into framebuffer 0.**
Midgard defers a render target's fragment work until that target's pass is flushed. An FBO pass is
flushed when the next target is bound, so it lands inside its own interval; framebuffer 0 is not
resolved until the swap, which is always outside the phase. Measured, on one scene (Account panel
over a Home grid swept by `nativejelly-homeosc`, `nativejelly-noidle` armed), p50 in ms:

| phase | target | before the flush fix | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blur.reduce1` | FBO | 0.001 | **0.329** |
| `blur.reduce2` | FBO | 0.129 | **0.127** |
| `blur.tap1` | FBO | 0.153 | **0.154** |
| `blur.tap2` | FBO | 0.158 | **0.160** |
| `blur.up` | FBO | 0.486 | **0.482** |
| `blur.copy` | reads fb 0 | 0.001 | 0.001 |
| `glass.composite` | fb 0 | 0.001 | 0.001 |
| `glass.frost` | fb 0 | 0.001 | 0.001 |
| `glass.foreground` | fb 0 | 0.001 | 0.001 |
| `profile.empty` | none | 0.323 | 0.131 |

`gpu_timer::phase` now issues a `glFlush` before `glEndQueryEXT`. That is what moved `blur.reduce1`
from 0.001 to 0.329 — it was the one FBO pass whose flushing bind fell outside its own phase. It
does nothing for the framebuffer-0 rows and cannot: `glFlush` submits queued commands but does not
make a tiler resolve a render pass that is still open. **A 0.001 ms reading is the signature of an
unmeasurable phase, not of a free one.** `profile.empty` is the noise floor and must be quoted
beside any phase result; a phase whose p95 is under the floor measured nothing.

### `frame.ui` measures the frame PERIOD, not GPU time

Do not read whole-frame timer numbers as GPU cost. The same scene, with and without the glass
panel, `nativejelly-noidle` armed so presents are continuous:

| leg | `fps=` (profiler ARMED — see below) | `frame.ui` p50 |
|---|---|---|
| Home grid, no glass | **60** | 16.63 ms |
| Account panel over it | **45–50** | 20.7 ms |

> **Those two `fps=` values belong to the INSTRUMENT, not to the app.** `frame.ui` brackets every
> frame with two `glFinish`es. With nothing armed, the same scene holds **60 fps in both legs** —
> measured later against a glass-absent control interleaved in the same rounds, and reproduced
> independently three times. Arming HWCNT drops a 60 fps control leg to 45 on its own. **Never
> quote `fps=` from a run with either profiler armed**; take pacing in a separate, unarmed run.

16.63 ms is one 60 Hz period to within 0.04 ms, held to ±0.01 across consecutive windows; 20.7 ms
is one period at the frame rate that leg actually achieved. The query spans the vsync wait, so it
reports whatever the frame period happens to be. `main.ui` behaves the same way and additionally
*rose* from 15.7 to 25.6 ms when the flush was added, because the flush breaks the pipeline inside
an interval that was already dominated by waiting.

**The honest whole-frame measurement is the heartbeat's `fps=`, not the timer.** On this scene the
Account glass costs 60 fps → 45–50 fps, i.e. about 4 ms of real frame time. The five FBO blur
passes account for 1.25 ms of that (0.66 ms of which is five instances of the query floor), so the
majority sits in the parts the timer cannot see: the `glCopyTexSubImage2D` capture, the render-pass
split it forces on the tiler, and the full-resolution `fs_glass` and frost quads.

### HWCNT is the attribution instrument, and its unit is CYCLES

Put one exact phase name in `/tmp/nativejelly-hwcnt`, launch the same warmed scene, retrieve
`/tmp/nativejelly-hwcnt.jsonl`. Never arm both triggers in one run — `app.rs` refuses if both are
present.

```sh
tools/analyze-hwcnt.py pkg/nativejelly-hwcnt.jsonl --phase blur.copy --discard 10
```

The reader is validated independently by `tools/mali-hwcnt-probe.c` (`make mali-hwcnt-probe`); its
target contract is UK 10.2, API 1, layout 5, 1280-byte dumps, 16 buffers, a 20480-byte mapping that
is exactly five 4096-byte target pages. `dump_size = (2 + nr_l2 + fls64(core_mask)) * 64 * 4`, and
on this MP2 part the five dump blocks are job manager, tiler, one MMU/L2 slice, shader core 0,
shader core 1 — confirmed against `patch_dump_buffer_hdr_v5` in Arm's `mali_kbase_vinstr.c`. Arm's
vinstr zeroes each client's accumulation buffer after every user-visible dump, so a sample is
already the delta since the previous `DUMP` ioctl and must not be differenced again.

Four things to hold onto when reading counter output:

- **Report cycles.** There is no GPU clock node anywhere in this TV's sysfs — no
  `/sys/class/devfreq` entry, no frequency file under `/sys/devices/platform/mali.0`. Cycles cannot
  be converted to milliseconds here, so compare cycles between legs and do not invent a clock.
- **Words 0..3 of every block are the block header, not counters.** Word 2 is `PRFCNT_EN`, and each
  of its bits enables a group of four counters. The profiler logs all five masks once per run.
  On this television they are jm `0xff`, tiler `0x1f`, l2 `0xffff`, sc0/sc1 `0xffff` — so **tiler
  words 20..63 are switched off in hardware and `TILER_ACTIVE` (word 22) is a structural zero**, not
  an idle tiler. Without the mask line those two are indistinguishable.
- **The counters are GPU-global.** There is no context filter in the ABI, and `surface-manager`
  composites on the same GPU every frame. A phase interval attributes the compositor's work to the
  phase. Design runs as a control-leg difference, not an absolute.
- **Shader counters are summed across both cores**, so shader cycles can exceed elapsed cycles.

Counter names are the reviewed T82x subset from Arm's r12p0 table, cross-checked against three
independent kernel trees and Arm's own gator daemon. `L2_EXT_READ` and `L2_EXT_WRITE` were wrong in
the first implementation (words 45 and 49; the correct words are 48 and 50 — 45 is reserved and 49
is `L2_EXT_READ_LINE`, a read counter that was being reported as writes). `tools/analyze-hwcnt.py`
carries the same table so archived JSONL can be re-decoded, and a host test asserts the two lists
are identical, because the raw words outlive the build that captured them.

### Run design

Run one phase per leg, on a warmed scene, and discard the leading samples. The blur chain only
executes on a **refresh**, and `Glass::EveryThirdPresent` only invalidates when the underlay
actually changed — so on a settled Home the blur phases never sample at all. Pair `nativejelly-acct`
with `nativejelly-homeosc` (a moving underlay) and `nativejelly-noidle` (continuous presents), which
yields about 20 refreshes a second. Collect production frame pacing, p50/p95/worst frame and
presented FPS in a separate run with both triggers absent.


## The direct-render experiment: result

`/tmp/nativejelly-blurdirect` (empty = 1/4 per axis; a power of two ≥ 4 selects the divisor) replaces
the capture path's `glCopyTexSubImage2D` + two reductions with a second render of the page, drawn
directly into the quarter-resolution tap target. The capture path stays the default, so the two are
an A/B on one binary.

### How the scene reaches a cropped, scaled target

No shader changed. Both vertex shaders map an authored pixel with `ndc = px / u_screen * 2 - 1`,
which does not depend on the target, so a scaled, negative-origin viewport places any sub-rectangle
of the canvas anywhere in any target:

```text
glViewport(-rx/S, -(gh - ry - rh)/S, gw/S, gh/S)   glScissor(0, 0, rw/S, rh/S)
```

The scene shaders' Y flip makes the direct render bottom-up — the same orientation a window copy
produces — and the chain that follows is three passes where the capture path runs five. Both are
odd, so the snapshot is top-down either way and `bottom_up` stays `false`.

### What had to change for the page to be drawn twice

The page draw is a pure function of UI state: it steps no spring (`home_draw` builds its `Env` with
`dt = 0`), starts no fetch, and every cache it touches hits on the second call. What is not safe is
the **global GL and renderer state its callees assume**, and each of these is a correctness fix, not
a nicety:

- `gfx::clip_set` built its scissor from `surface::viewport()`/`scale()` — the default framebuffer's
  geometry — and `clip_clear` was a bare `glDisable(GL_SCISSOR_TEST)`. Inside the source pass every
  `Painter::clip` would clip a different part of the picture and then throw away the region clamp.
  Both now consult a render-target override, which is the same `(vx, vy, scale)` triple the viewport
  took.
- `home_draw` contains a glass owner of its own (the tab track). `draw_blur_backdrop` now refuses
  outright during a source pass, so it cannot re-enter `blur_snapshot` — which would copy
  framebuffer 0 while an FBO is bound, then rebind framebuffer 0 mid-pass.
- `home_draw` opens with `ui::guard`, which **catches** a panic and returns normally. The restore is
  therefore a `Drop` guard: nothing else in the app ever binds framebuffer 0, so a panic that
  skipped it would leave every later frame rendering into a 480x270 texture, with no crash and no
  log line.
- The page's own profiler phases and the framedrop card counters are suppressed during the pass, or
  they record twice per frame under one name.

**Correctness first.** With the hero pinned (`nativejelly-heroidx`) so rotation cannot confound it,
the two paths are pixel-near-identical: mean absolute difference 0.01/765 over the frame, **maximum
3/255, confined entirely to the glass panel**, and every pixel outside the blur region bit-identical.

**Whole-frame GPU work**, HWCNT `frame.ui`, medians over the sample distribution (not over log
lines), three interleaved repeats per leg. Run-to-run spread within a leg is 0.06–0.09%:

| scene (region) | capture | direct | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account panel (608x396) | 10,107,885 | 10,086,395 | −0.21% ← **WRONG, a median** |
| Account + glass tab bar (1324x456) | 10,453,654 | 10,428,664 | −0.24% ← **WRONG, a median** |

**Both rows are medians, and on this scene the median is structurally blind to the blur.** The
chain runs on ~28% of presents, so the median reports frames in which it never executed at all.
Classify frames EXACTLY by `FRAG_NUM_TILES` — 4096 = no refresh, 6050 = capture refresh, 4912 =
direct refresh at 1/4, nothing in between — and take the MEAN. Three agents in three sessions then
get **−3.46% / −3.25% / −3.55%**, and the marginal cost of one capture refresh agrees to 0.2%
across four independent sessions (1,877,317 cycles). **The direct path is worth −3.3% of the
frame.** The rows are left here because the error is the instructive part: an earlier revision
claimed 3.7% from reading `PROFILE` log tails, this revision claimed 0.21% from the right file with
the wrong statistic, and only the third attempt was both. The whole-frame quads and
tiles are identical on both paths (1,953,471 and 4,096), which is the simplest statement of why:
the source stage is a small enough slice of the frame that replacing it does not move the total.

The source stage itself really is 4.5x cheaper (see below); it is simply a small slice. The
per-phase HWCNT figures are `glFinish`-serialized and therefore overstate what an un-serialized
frame saves — by about 8x here, which is worth remembering before pricing any pass from a phase
number alone.

**What the glass costs at all**, same scene, control leg with the panel absent:

| leg | GPU_ACTIVE / frame | delta |
|---|---|---|
| Home scrolling, no glass | 8,955,222 | — |
| + Account glass panel | 10,104,204 | +1,148,982 (**+11.4%**) |
| + glass tab bar as well | 10,453,654 | +349,450 (**+3.4%**) |

The main UI is the other 88.6%, at **3.65x overdraw** for 1080p.

### Draw-call culling, and the two modes

A scissor bounds what a source pass may write but does not stop a tile-based GPU binning geometry or
walking tiles, so `gfx::culled` skips any quad whose authored bounds miss the region, at every draw
primitive and both text sites. It is exact rather than conservative: the backdrop is a crop of the
page, so a quad that misses the region cannot contribute a fragment to it.

`blur.scene` measures **bimodally**, and the two modes are now identified. Sample by sample across
three runs, 2.8% / 4.5% / 5.7% of samples land in an expensive mode of ~2.0M cycles and 2076 tiles —
about what processing the whole 480x270 target costs — and the rest sit in a steady mode of ~155k
cycles and 36 tiles. The expensive samples are **the first ten of a run, plus roughly one in a
hundred thereafter**: warm-up, and the frames where new artwork lands and the page genuinely redraws
more than the region. There is nothing in between, so a **mean over a window containing both names a
value that never occurred** — which is exactly how two opposite and equally wrong conclusions were
drawn from single log lines. Both profiler summaries now print `SPREAD=<n>x` beside the mean whenever
the window's max exceeds twice its min, and say in the line itself that the mean is not
representative.

Steady-state source stage, medians, floor `profile.empty` = 73,410 cycles:

| stage | GPU_ACTIVE | net of floor | tiles |
|---|---|---|---|
| capture: `blur.copy` + `reduce1` + `reduce2` | 696,242 | 476,012 | 892 |
| direct, before culling | 231,414 | 158,004 | 36 |
| direct, after culling | **155,200** | **81,790** | **36** |

So culling is worth about a third, and the direct source pass is **4.5x cheaper gross and 5.8x
cheaper net** than the capture and two reductions it replaces. That is a far larger factor than the
0.21% whole-frame result, and reconciling the two is the single most important lesson in this note.
Naively: the source stage runs on one present in three, so `(696,242 - 155,200) / 3 = 180k` cycles
per frame, or **1.7%** of a 10.6M-cycle frame — eight times the 0.21% actually measured. The gap is
not a mystery, it is the serialization: every per-phase HWCNT figure is bracketed by `glFinish`,
which drains the pipeline and bills the phase for work an un-serialized frame overlaps with
everything else. **A phase-level cycle count is an attribution instrument, not a budget.** Price a
change by a whole-frame `frame.ui` A/B; use per-phase numbers only to say where the work sits.

**One earlier run (`f-scene.jsonl`) had 81% of its samples in the expensive mode and is the outlier
that produced the "2.8x worse" reading this note previously carried.** Its Home evidently never
settled. Grade a source-pass run by its expensive-sample fraction before quoting its median.

### Scale

Only divisors that are powers of two ≥ 4 are accepted: the taps ping-pong through `a`/`b`, which are
allocated at a quarter of the canvas, so 1/2 would need a second half-size target and 2 MB more.
Tap offsets are scaled by `4/S` so the authored blur radius is held fixed as the source resolution
moves — without that a scale sweep changes two variables at once.

**1/8 runs; 1/16 never has, on this television.** 1080 % 16 = 8, so the divisibility guard refuses
it and logs `blur direct: canvas 1920x1080 does not divide by 16`. Any earlier text listing 1/16 as
usable is wrong. The grading that was outstanding here is done and lives in
`glass-hardware-budget.md`: the whole usable ladder spans 0.96% of a mean frame and zero frames,
1/4 is the MATCHED sampling rate for this kernel rather than a compromise, and both neighbours are
worse — 1/8 loses 2.2% of large-scale contrast to save 0.38%, and 1/2 costs more *and* looks
rougher, because the Kawase tap offsets scale with the source while the bilinear box does not.

## Part 5 — the other 88.6%: what the MAIN UI submits, and why removing 37% of it bought 0.8%

Part 4 priced the glass at +11.4% of frame GPU cycles and recorded that the main UI is the rest,
"at 3.65x overdraw for 1080p". That sentence is true and it is the most misleading line in this
note, for two reasons this part settles with measurements: **most of the 3.65x is not ours**, and
**the part of it that is ours is very nearly free.**

### Two instruments, neither of which is a GPU counter

`FRAG_QUADS_RAST` is GPU-global, so it cannot say whose quads it counted. Two things were added to
answer that without guessing.

**`/tmp/nativejelly-overdraw`** — a CPU-side ledger (`nj_gfx::overdraw`) that sums, per draw class, the
screen-VISIBLE area of every quad the app submits, clipped to the panel and to `Painter::clip`'s
live box. It is not `glFinish`-serialised and it cannot be billed for another process's work. It
runs in the desktop simulator too, and gives the same authored-pixel answer there, because it works
in authored coordinates.

**`/tmp/nativejelly-drawmask=<classes>`** — refuse every draw of the named classes, so a whole-frame
`frame.ui` HWCNT A/B against the unmasked control prices that class **as the frame sees it**,
un-serialised. `all` draws nothing, and is therefore the **compositor floor**. Every leg it
produces except the control is a broken picture by construction; it is a measurement knob.

### The frame, decomposed

Scene: Home, `nativejelly-homeosc` + `nativejelly-noidle`, no glass. Three interleaved repeats per leg,
first 60 samples discarded, ~1,050 samples per run, within-leg spread 0.05–0.07%.

| leg | GPU_ACTIVE / frame | FRAG_QUADS_RAST | as pixels | tiles |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| control (the app draws) | 8,740,395 | 1,875,881 | 7,503,524 | 4,096 |
| `drawmask=all` (app draws nothing) | 3,007,196 | 519,120 | 2,076,480 | 4,080 |
| **difference = the app's own draw** | **5,733,199 (65.6%)** | **1,356,761** | **5,427,044** | 16 |

The floor leg's 519,120 quads are 2,076,480 pixels — **exactly one 1920x1080 composite** — with
`TEX_WORDS` 2,076,480, i.e. exactly one texel per pixel. That is the wayland compositor blitting our
surface, and it is **34.4% of the frame's GPU cycles for work this app cannot remove**. Tiles barely
move between the legs because both still resolve two full-screen render passes (2,040 tiles each at
this part's 32x32 tiling); drawing nothing does not save the pass, only its fragments.

So the app's own overdraw is **2.62x**, not 3.65x. The missing 1.0x is the compositor.

### Where the app's 5.43M pixels go — and it is not the cards

The ledger, on the same scene (television and simulator agree to the pixel; the HWCNT difference
above puts the app at 5,427,044 against the ledger's 5,386,592, **0.75% apart**, which is what
validates the ledger):

| class | px / frame | draws | share of the app |
|---|---|---|---|
| `image` — the full-bleed hero photograph (+ 6 icons) | 2,150,733 | 7 | 39.9% |
| `rect` — the two atmospheric-ramp bands (+ 34 chrome rects) | 1,446,368 | 36 | 26.9% |
| `grad` — the hero corner wedge, two quads | 1,410,048 | 2 | 26.2% |
| `card` — the peek row's four tiles | 279,480 | 4 | 5.2% |
| `text` | ~75,000 | 8 | 1.4% |
| `shadow` | 25,364 | 2 | 0.5% |
| **total** | **5,386,592** | ~58 | **2.60x the panel** |

**The established scene is the HERO, not the grid.** `nativejelly-homeosc` moves the grid's focus
indices; it does not dive the snap, so Home stays on its billboard. Three stacked full-panel layers
— the photograph, the atmospheric ramp and the corner wedge — are **90% of everything the screen
submits**. The card composites everyone assumes are the expensive part are 5%.

### The experiment: fold the hero's whole ground into one pass

`/tmp/nativejelly-heroground` (`ui::widgets::hero_ground` + `shaders/fs_hero.frag`) draws the
photograph and BOTH scrim fields in **one** quad instead of the art plus four blended gradient
quads over it. Both fields are closed forms of the authored pixel position — `home::base_scrim_a`
and `hero_scrim_a` feathered over `[HERO_SCRIM_TOP, HERO_SCRIM_KNEE]` — and both are
`theme::SCRIM_INK`, so two straight-alpha layers of one ink compose exactly as `a1 + a2 - a1*a2`
and the art folds into the same single blend:

```text
want   dst' = mix(mix(dst, art, A), ink, B)
s      = 1 - (1-A)*(1-B)
src    = (art*A*(1-B) + ink*B) / s
```

Exact in real arithmetic; what differs is 8-bit rounding, because the shipped path quantises the
framebuffer three times where this quantises once. The screen owns the preconditions (one art layer
at a time, so a hero flip falls back; no photograph yet, so the scrims still have the wash).

**It is the same picture.** Simulator, hero pinned with `nativejelly-heroidx=0`, 960x540: **maximum
absolute difference 1/255**, mean 0.081/255, over 101,018 of 518,400 pixels — and **not one pixel
differs by 2**. That is the double-rounding, and nothing else. Ledger, same pair: 5,387,031 px
(x2.60) to 2,608,407 px (x1.26), `grad` 2 quads to 0, `rect` 36 draws to 34; on the television the
same pair reads 5,362,974 px (x2.59) to 2,584,350 px (x1.25).

**The first on-panel capture pair was thrown away, and the reason is worth writing down**:
`nativejelly-heroidx` JUMPS the billboard to a pool page, it does not stop it rotating. `HERO_AUTO_S`
is 8 s, so a capture taken 16 s after launch had already advanced two pages, and the control frame
was caught mid-FLIP — which is also exactly the state the fold declines. The diff was 249/255 and
said nothing about the shader. A capture comparison on this screen has to be taken inside the first
rotation window, with `nativejelly-homeosc` absent (its 350 ms focus step moves the peek row under
the shutter).

Retaken that way — no oscillator, shot 6 s after launch — the ON-PANEL pair
(`tools/capture-screen.sh … DISPLAY`, 1920x1080) is **max 2/255, mean 0.096/255, with exactly ONE
pixel of 2,073,600 differing by more than one code**. A second shot of each leg ~5 s later is
254/255 apart, which is the rotation doing precisely what it did the first time and is why the
first pair was thrown away rather than reported.

**And it is worth almost nothing.** Television, three interleaved repeats per leg, ~925 samples per
run, first 60 discarded, within-leg spread 0.04% (control) and 0.01% (folded):

| counter | control | folded | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU_ACTIVE / frame | 8,746,572 | 8,676,083 | **−70,489 (−0.81%)** |
| FRAG_QUADS_RAST | 1,875,660 | 1,177,742 | −697,918 (**−37.21%**) |
| LS_WORDS | 7,762,728 | 4,984,257 | −2,778,471 (−35.79%) |
| ARITH_WORDS | 15,527,280 | 15,515,117 | −12,163 (**−0.08%**) |
| TEX_WORDS | 4,597,344 | 4,597,344 | 0 |
| FRAG_NUM_TILES | 4,096 | 4,096 | 0 |
| heartbeat `fps=` | 60 | 60 | 0 |

**Removing 37% of the frame's rasterized fragments bought 0.81% of its GPU cycles**, and the
counters say exactly why. Each removed fragment cost **one LS word and no arithmetic**: the driver
folds `mix(uniform, uniform, varying)` and the four-corner bilinear field into varying
interpolation, which runs on the load/store pipe. That pipe was at **44.8%** occupancy
(7.76M of 17.34M tripipe cycles) while the arithmetic pipe was at **89.5%** (15.53M). The frame is
**arithmetic-bound**, and the overdraw carried none of it. 130,299 fragment core-cycles for
2,791,672 removed pixels is **0.047 core-cycles per pixel** — the removed layers were, to a very
good approximation, free.

The 2,778,471 LS words removed against the ledger's 2,778,624 predicted pixels — **0.006% apart** —
is also the tightest available check that the ledger and the counters are measuring one thing.

**So "3.65x overdraw" is not headroom.** A third of it belongs to the compositor, and most of the
rest is blended varying interpolation on a half-idle pipe. Culling app overdraw on this part is
worth roughly 0.02% of the frame per percent of fragments removed. Anything that pays here has to
remove ARITHMETIC, not fragments.

### What this means for anyone optimising this app

1. **Stop reading `FRAG_QUADS_RAST` as a budget.** On this part a rasterized fragment costs between
   nothing and a great deal depending on which pipe its shader uses, and the cheapest ones are
   exactly the big full-screen ones. Price a change by a whole-frame `frame.ui` A/B or not at all.
2. **34.4% of the frame is the compositor** and is not addressable from inside this process. The
   app's own share of a hero frame is 5,733,199 cycles; that is the whole size of the prize.
3. **The bottleneck is the arithmetic pipe at 89.5% occupancy.** The lever is arith words per
   fragment on the quads that carry them, not the number of quads.
4. **`nj_gfx::overdraw` is worth keeping** whichever way the fold goes. It is compiled out of a release
   build entirely, it runs in the simulator, and it is the only instrument here that can attribute a
   fragment to a draw class — the counters cannot, because they are GPU-global.
5. The fold itself is **worth having in the tree behind its flag and not worth switching on**: 0.81%
   does not pay for a GLSL copy of two design curves that `theme.rs` and two screens own, and every
   future retune of either curve would have to be made in both places. It becomes interesting the
   day the surface is not 1080p — at 4K the fragment and load/store work scale by four while the
   arithmetic per fragment does not, which is precisely the condition under which the pipe it
   unloads becomes the one that binds.

### What a fragment costs, by draw class — the table the ledger exists to produce

Same instrument, same scene: refuse ONE class and take a whole-frame `frame.ui` A/B against the
control. Two interleaved repeats per leg, ~850 samples per run, within-leg spread 0.03–0.13%.
Control 8,756,698 GPU_ACTIVE per frame.

| class refused | px removed | Δ GPU_ACTIVE | Δ % of frame | **cycles / px** | Δ ARITH_WORDS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `card` — 4 peek-row tiles, `fs_img` full path (SDF + rim + penumbra) | 281,924 | −851,188 | **−9.72%** | **3.02** | −1,652,307 |
| `image` — the full-bleed hero photograph, `fs_img` FLAT path | 2,153,440 | −2,102,996 | **−24.02%** | **0.98** | −4,288,786 |
| `text` — 8 glyph strings | 84,216 | −60,018 | −0.69% | 0.71 | −89,628 |
| the ramp + the wedge (via `heroground`) | 2,791,672 | −70,489 | −0.81% | **0.025** | −12,163 |

**A card-composite fragment costs 120x what a gradient fragment costs, and a textured full-screen
one costs 39x.** Every delta tracks `ARITH_WORDS / 2` to within 10% (two shader cores, one
instruction word per cycle each) — which is the same statement as "the frame is arithmetic-bound",
arrived at from the other side.

So the ranking, on a hero frame, is: **the wayland compositor 34.4%, the hero photograph 24.0%,
four card composites 9.7%, the glass 11.4%** (Part 4, same scene), everything else under 1% each.
Two consequences worth carrying:

* **The photograph is the app's single most expensive object**, at nearly one GPU cycle per screen
  pixel, and it is one draw call with the simplest shader in the app. There is no overdraw to
  remove there; it is a 1280x720 texture read magnified to the panel, and `L2_EXT_READ_BEATS` falls
  56% when it goes.
* **These deltas are a RANKING and a per-pixel price, not an additive budget.** They sum to 35.2%
  against the 65.6% that `drawmask=all` removes, because `GPU_ACTIVE` is an OR across concurrently
  active units: the app's arithmetic partly hides behind the compositor's texture stalls, so
  removing one class frees less than removing it in isolation would. Price a real change by its own
  A/B, exactly as this note has said since Part 4 — do not build a budget by adding these rows up.

## 2026-09-02: the Home motion regression — a census, and what a full-screen fragment costs

Reported: Hero paging ~46 fps and the Hero→first-shelf fold ~38 fps against a 50 fps gate (the
`home-hero` / `home-fold` scenes, `nativejelly-heroosc` / `nativejelly-homefoldosc`). The previous
diagnosis blamed the profile chip's second glass surface and the top bar's blur source pass. Both
were measured and both were wrong; what follows is the record, because every step of it
contradicted a reasonable expectation.

**1. The frame-drop detector reads as CPU and is not.** `nativejelly-framedrop=1` on the hero scene:
`draw=24.0 ms p50, swap=0.3 ms`. A new profiler mode, **`/tmp/nativejelly-cpuprof`** — the render
thread's own inclusive wall time per `ui::profile::phase`, every phase at once, no `glFinish` —
put 26 ms of that in **`hm.clear`**, the frame's first framebuffer-0 command, and ~2 ms in the whole
of Home's real work (`hm.hero` 0.9, `hm.grid` 0.5, `hm.tabs` 0.2, the blur source pass 0.8 CPU
including its three FBO passes). On this driver the wait for the GPU lands in the first command
that needs the back buffer, so a fat `draw=` is a GPU-bound frame until this mode says otherwise.

**2. Glass ON is faster than glass OFF, three times running.** Same scene, interleaved:

| leg | hero fps | fold fps | GPU_ACTIVE / frame (hero) |
|---|---|---|---|
| shipped: glass, refresh every present (`glasshz=1`) | 46 | 38 | 14.44M |
| `nativejelly-flattabs` — no glass, no source pass | 35 | 30 | 13.81M |
| `nativejelly-glasshz=8` — glass, refresh 1 present in 8 | 36 | 30 | — |

More GPU work, seven milliseconds less frame period. The only structural difference is that the
direct source pass submits FBO render passes immediately after the swap, before anything touches
framebuffer 0. Whether that is Mali kbase DVFS reacting to a gap-free submission
(`/sys/devices/platform/mali.0/dvfs_period` exists; `power_policy` is `demand`) or the driver
starting the frame's fragment work earlier is NOT settled — but the consequence is: **lowering
the glass cadence or removing the source pass to "save work" costs 20% of the frame rate, and any
change to that path has to be re-measured on the set.**

**3. The census: `nativejelly-hwcnt` (`frame.ui`) + `nativejelly-drawmask=<class>`, hero paging,
flat tabs.** Control 13.81M GPU_ACTIVE per frame — against 8.76M for a hero frame on 2026-08-22,
which is the regression stated in cycles.

| class refused | Δ GPU_ACTIVE | Δ ARITH_WORDS | px removed | cycles / px |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `grad` — the hero corner scrim, `draw_grad4` | **−5.30M (38%)** | −10.6M | 1.43M | **3.7** |
| `rect` — the two atmospheric ramps, track, buttons | −2.65M | −5.0M | 1.44M | 1.8 |
| `image` — the photograph | −2.17M | −4.3M | 2.15M | 1.0 |
| `card` — the peek row's tiles | −1.41M | −2.7M | 0.46M | 3.1 |
| `text` | −0.13M | −0.1M | 0.10M | 1.3 |
| `ambient` — hidden under opaque art on this scene | −0.00M | — | — | — |

The Aug-22 table priced "the ramp + the wedge" at 0.025 cycles/px. `dec32f2e` (2026-09-01) had
rewritten `fs_ambient.frag` — the ONE program behind both `draw_grad4` and the page wash — with a
`fract(sin(dot()))` dither hash evaluated on every fragment (`u_noise` only scaled it to zero for
a scrim) and a highp coordinate. `sin` on Midgard is a range reduction plus a polynomial; the
scrim went to ~7 arithmetic words a fragment.

**4. Three fixes, each measured on its own (hero frame, flat tabs, GPU_ACTIVE per frame):**

| state | hero GPU/frame | hero fps (glass) | fold fps (glass) |
|---|---|---|---|
| as found | 13.81M | 46 | 38 |
| dither behind a uniform branch, cheap hash | 11.68M | 54 | 41 |
| + highp→mediump coordinate, flat rects routed to the ambient program | 12.30M | 52 | 39 |
| − that routing, + bilinear as ONE fragment mix (corner mixes as varyings, `vs_ambient.vert`) | 10.63M | 59 | 43 |
| + the wash's dither as a 64x64 noise TEXTURE fetch (`gfx::noise_tex`) | 10.63M | 59 | 45 |
| + the wash undithered while Home's hero is in motion | 10.63M (fold 11.15M) | **59** | **53** |

Three of those rows are lessons rather than steps. **A three-mix bilinear fragment costs ~2.3
cycles a pixel on this part even with no hash** — the two horizontal corner mixes are linear in
`u`, a varying interpolates a linear function exactly, so they moved into the vertex shader and
the fragment keeps one mix. **Routing a flat rect to that program made the frame 0.6M cycles
DEARER** than `fs_src`'s one-mix early-out, even though `fs_src` itself now prices a flat pixel at
~1.8 cycles (Midgard sizes the register file for the whole grown shader — capsule arcs, glow —
and the early-out runs at that occupancy). And **an interleaved-gradient hash in highp still cost
the fold's full-screen wash ~4M cycles**: `gl_FragCoord` is highp, so the hash was fp32 on 2M
pixels. The texture fetch moved it to the idle pipe (`TEX_WORDS` +1.7M, `ARITH_WORDS` −5M), and
the wash then still cost 2.5M for one mix plus the blend — which is why it is now undithered while
the hero is mid-fold or mid-slide, the only times it is visible on Home and the only times it is
behind a moving translucent picture nobody reads as a gradient. At rest, with the photograph absent
or still arriving, it dithers as before.

**The rule this leaves behind:** on the T820 the arithmetic pipe binds, and a 60 fps frame is about
11M cycles ≈ 22M words for EVERYTHING on the panel, compositor included — roughly ten words per
screen pixel, total. A full-screen quad therefore cannot afford more than a couple of operations
per fragment. Uniform-branch every optional term, push anything linear into a varying, put lookups
on the texture pipe, and price the result with `hwcnt` + `drawmask`, never by reading the GLSL.

## 2026-09-02 (later): the ambient wash's dither — a 64px plaid, and what an overlay actually costs

Two reported items, measured on the dev set (webOS 4.5, Mali-T820) in one session. The first was
a picture bug with three candidate causes and the measurement killed two of them; the second was a
performance question whose answer turned out to be "there is no problem", which is only worth
anything because the numbers are written down.

### Item 6 — "banding and strange visual patterns" on the Person page

The wash is `route_screen`'s full-screen `AmbientWash`, which — unlike Home's and Detail's, both of
which pass `dither=false` while the hero moves — dithers on EVERY frame it draws. Three hypotheses
were on the table: (a) the 64px noise tile repeating visibly, (b) ±½ LSB being too little dither to
break a contour, (c) the mediump `v_uv` quantising over a 1080px span.

**The instrument first, because two of these are invisible to it.** A `tools/tv-session.sh shot` is
the composited panel output, so it shows the app's own 8-bit result and NOT what LG's picture
processing does to it afterwards. It can therefore see a tile repeat and a contour; it cannot see
sharpening amplifying either. It does resolve the dither — residual std 0.47 LSB against a clean
region — so its silence would have meant something, which is the precondition for reading it.

Region: `y 450–1050, x 1500–1900` of the person page, right of the poster shelf and below the bio
panel, i.e. wash and nothing else. The gradient there is **4.6 LSB over 600 rows — one 8-bit step
per ~130 rows**, which is the slowest ramp in the app and the worst case for contouring.

**(c) is arithmetic, and it is not close.** An fp16 `v_uv` steps by 1/2048 of the quad; across a
span of 4.6 LSB that is 0.0045 LSB per step, **445x below one 8-bit quantum**. The shader header
already argued this and the measurement agrees with it. Nothing was changed here, and a `highp`
coordinate remains the wrong fix — it was priced at 3.2M cycles a frame earlier the same day.

**(a) is the defect, and it is unambiguous.** Autocorrelation of the residual after removing a
fitted ramp, on the panel capture:

| lag | 63 | **64** | 65 | 128 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| horizontal, 64px tile | +0.131 | **+0.570** | +0.134 | +0.277 |
| vertical, 64px tile | +0.186 | **+0.366** | +0.185 | **+0.703** |
| horizontal, 256px tile | +0.089 | +0.083 | +0.089 | +0.016 |
| vertical, 256px tile | +0.144 | +0.141 | +0.141 | +0.124 |

A spike four times its own neighbours at exactly the tile period, and a bigger one at twice it: the
tile was repeating **30 times across the panel** as a plaid. That is the "strange visual patterns".
The old justification — "64 is well past the eye's ability to see a repeat at ±½ LSB amplitude" —
confuses two thresholds: a PERIODIC signal is found far below the contrast at which its own grain
is resolved. At 256 the curve is a smooth monotone decay with no spike anywhere.

**(b) is real but second-order, and the simulation says so plainly.** On this measured ramp the
existing ±½ LSB uniform dither already flattens the staircase about tenfold, and triangular dither
is marginally WORSE on absolute blurred error because it is more noise. What ±1 LSB TPDF removes is
noise MODULATION — under uniform dither the quantisation error's variance still tracks the signal,
which reads as the wash breathing or clumping rather than as grain. Per-row error-variance
coefficient of variation falls **0.44 → 0.08**. The amplified-residual crops show it: the 64px
image has visible horizontal clumping, the 256px one is structureless.

The measured residual std moved **0.4692 → 0.5502 LSB**. That is not a loose "it got noisier": the
capture's own noise floor solves to 0.369 LSB from the first number, and TPDF at ±1 LSB then
predicts 0.550 — an independent confirmation that the dither really is triangular at the intended
amplitude, from a number nobody tuned.

**The triangle is baked into the TILE, and that is the whole trick.** Forming it in the shader would
be a second channel plus an add on 2M fragments; storing the mean of two independent hashes leaves
the fragment expression byte-for-byte identical and moves the entire difference into `u_noise`'s
scale (`1/255` → `2/255`). **Zero shader change.** The only cost that exists is the tile's footprint.

**Cost, `fps:settings-root` with `nativejelly-hwcnt`, phase `frame.ui`, n=60 per sample, steady state
(the first sample after launch is a 13.7M settle frame and is discarded):**

| counter, per frame | 64px RPDF | 256px TPDF | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU_ACTIVE | 8.761M | 8.766M | **+0.06%** |
| ARITH_WORDS | 15.637M | 15.639M | +0.01% |
| TEX_WORDS | 4.308M | 4.312M | +0.08% |
| L2_EXT_READ_BEATS | 160k | 256k | **+60%** |
| L2 read hit rate | 82.6% | 74.1% | −8.5 pt |

The cost lands exactly and only where theory puts it — a 256 KB tile misses L2 far more often than a
16 KB one and pulls ~96k more external read beats a frame — and **none of it reaches GPU_ACTIVE**,
because on this part the arithmetic pipe binds and the memory pipe beside it has headroom. The
+0.06% is inside the 64px leg's own ±17k sample spread. Pacing, taken in a separate run with NO
profiler armed: `fps:settings-root` **60 fps median (60–61) against its floor of 50**, and the whole
tier 25/25. The old "small enough to live in the texture cache whole" argument is genuinely given
up, and it was worth less than it read: the mapping is 1:1 in screen space under `GL_NEAREST`, so
each fragment fetches a distinct texel in tile order — a coherent streaming read, which is the
pattern a texture cache is best at, not the random re-reads a resident tile protects against.

### Item 12 — every popover/modal with a blur backdrop, measured

`./tests/run.py --fps --fps-player`, no profiler armed, medians over post-warmup 1 Hz samples.
`fps=` is frames swapped and `loop=` is loop iterations; a settled overlay is SUPPOSED to read ~0
`fps` (the present gate), so an idle number near zero beside a healthy `loop=` is a pass, not a
stall. Player-tier scenes carry no `fps` gate at all by design — `ui::idle` excludes the player
route, so `fps=` there grades nothing.

**25/25 with the new scene added, and there is no blur performance problem to fix.** Every glass
surface holds the panel rate while something animates over it and falls to the keepalive when it
settles — which is the pair of properties the floors and ceilings exist to pin, and passing both is
the thing a single number cannot show. The optimisation this item anticipated (a cached glass being
re-sourced every frame, a scrim drawn twice, a full-resolution source pass) was looked for and is
not present. Note also the standing measured warning that still applies: **the glass source pass
refreshing every present runs FASTER than a rarer refresh on this GPU** (the 2026-09-02 section
above), so nothing here should be "saved" by lowering `DEFAULT_DYNAMIC_PERIOD` without an fps A/B.

**Three overlays remain without a scene, and all three are blocked on something outside this file.**
`more_menu` (`overlay=more`) and `alt_sources` have no boot trigger at all — reaching them needs a
new `dev::flag` in `app.rs`. `tracks_panel` has `nativejelly-tracks` but emits no `overlay=` tag, so a
scene naming one would fail as "never entered this screen"; it needs the tag added beside the other
five in `app.rs`'s heartbeat match. `person_bio` is the interesting one — the ONLY
`Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP` popover in the app, so it is the only surface where the refresh cadence is
live — and it is opened by a key press on the person page, which no boot trigger expresses.

## 2026-09-04: the shared dither's branch, the host cache's ledger, and a spinner that never stopped

Four reported frame-rate items were one renderer census: hero paging at ~50 fps, the hero→shelf
fold under its floor, the Settings entry ramp with 89 ms frames and a grey pause, the Library
popovers at ~20 fps beside a smooth account menu, and the Cast & Crew row dropping frames. Every
number below is from the debug install on the dev set (`tests/run.py --fps`, `nativejelly-hwcnt=frame.ui`,
`nativejelly-cpuprof`, `nativejelly-framedrop=1`), and the "before" column is `f3bdbdce`.

**The bisect.** `fps:home-hero` / `fps:home-fold` medians across the last five commits:
`a0a682af` 57/53, `2365a525` 57/53, `f361b776` 57/–, `becb4e56` **50/48**, `f3bdbdce` 50/48. One
commit, and a binary-swap bisect (the same worktree, four binaries) said the same. Hardware
counters on the hero paging scene: the fast builds spend 20.5M arithmetic words a frame (12.0M GPU
cycles), the slow ones **24.6M (14.0M)**, with rasterised quads and texture words unchanged — so
the +4M words were per-fragment ALU on the same pixels. `becb4e56` had put `shaders/dither.glsl`
behind a uniform branch on FIVE programs, two of them the per-rect `fs_src` and per-shadow
`fs_shadow`. Rule 1 of that file ("a uniform branch is resolved per draw, so a draw with
`u_dither = 0` pays nothing") is true of the fetch and the add and false of the branch: on this
Midgard it cost ~2 words a fragment on every rect, pill, scrim and shadow in the frame, and the
ramp policy had answered 0 for nearly all of them.

**What changed, as shared mechanisms.**

- `fs_src.frag` and `fs_shadow.frag` are plain again (`glsl!`); `dither_for_ramp` and its two
  thresholds are gone. The three slow-field programs keep the prelude, and the glass amplitude is
  per draw rather than a link-time constant. (The same day's GLOBAL motion gate — no field dithered
  while any spring was in flight — lasted one day: it flickered the wash's bands in and out on every
  focus spring on Settings, the picker and first run, screens that were at 60 fps with the noise on.
  Only the two page washes under moving artwork kept a motion gate, `gfx::page_wash_dither` — and
  that one lost its own motion term on 2026-09-19, for the same reason at a smaller scale; see the
  addendum at the end of this file.)
- `ui::idle::should_present` presents one **settle frame** after motion stops, so the LIVE picture left
  on the panel is the dithered one.
- The ambient field has an in-flight twin program (`fs_ambient.frag` linked behind
  `shaders/dither_stub.glsl`, `gfx::ambient_program`), with no uniform, sampler or branch at all;
  `draw_grad4` always takes it. That alone moved the fold from 50 to 55.
- A flat-colour program (`shaders/fs_flat.frag`) draws every uniform, square, unfocused rect —
  the full-screen scrims — with no interpolation.
- The popover host cache (`ui::popover::host`) is on the Library menus, Settings and the decision
  alert, and its refresh decision was rebuilt three times under review: page damage is now
  **attributed at the source and counted** (`idle::OwnScope` around a panel's update, its
  drawing, the input it holds, and the host page pass itself; `idle::take_page_damage`), page
  motion is a refresh reason only while every holder is fading, and the fps scenes' oscillators
  `wake` instead of `invalidate`.

**The account menu, three wrong answers deep.** `fps:home-acct-glass` read 47 before this pass
and **26** through most of it: first the two-bit ledger stopped masking the panel's own per-frame
appear/marquee invalidate; then page MOTION was a refresh reason while Home's decorations kept
moving under the frozen page; then, with both fixed, a simulator backtrace at the unscoped
`invalidate` named `home::draw_status`'s `Spinner::draw` — a spinner on the host reports damage
from its own draw, so any refresh frame (the page drawn for real) re-armed the next, forever.
`host::PagePass` now scopes the page draw: what the page reports while being drawn into the
snapshot IS the snapshot. Simulator: 799 host refreshes in 14 s → 2. Device: 60 fps.

| scene / boot | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `fps:home-hero` median | 50 | **60** |
| `fps:home-fold` median / robust_min | 48 / 46 | **55 / 53** |
| `fps:home-acct-glass` median / robust_min | 47 / 43 | **60 / 60** |
| `fps:settings-root` | 60 | 60 |
| account menu over Home under `acctosc`, GPU cycles per frame (mean) | 23.1M | **4.3M** |
| `fps:library-switch` (Sort menu, p50 draw) | 33 ms | 16 ms |
| hero paging, GPU cycles / ARITH words per frame (mean) | 14.0M / 24.6M | 11.2M / 17.8M |
| Settings boot (entry ramp, Privacy, Delete alert), GPU per frame mean / p50 | 12.2M / 9.5M | 8.4M / 6.2M |
| Settings entry, worst draw frames | 3 × 89 ms | 1 × 69 ms |
| Cast & Crew scroll (Depeche Mode: 101), GPU per frame mean / p50 | 10.7M / 10.6M | 8.4M / 7.5M |
| Cast & Crew scroll, worst steady frames | ~50 ms | ~42 ms |

Still open from the same census, and not renderer work: the show detail's entry pays two ~80 ms
CPU frames rasterising the episode list and the hero text (`dt.eps`, `dt.hero`); the Cast & Crew
row's remaining drops are the page's fill (a full-screen wash plus fifteen shadowed circle
composites) crossing the budget on the frames the ambient twin does not reach.

### 2026-09-19 addendum: the page wash asks its own artwork, and the answer is unmeasured

The gate this section left in place — `gfx::page_wash_dither`, the page wash's own slide flag AND
the page's motion verdict — has been narrowed again, to the slide flag alone, spelled as a question
about the ARTWORK rather than about the frame. The owner's report was the same sentence as
2026-09-04's, one screen further in: "ambient background has discretisation during animations".

The mechanism is the one this file already documents and did not follow far enough. Every spring
integrator reports to `ui::idle::note_spring`, and `AmbientWash::step` drives TWELVE corner springs
— so a wash dissolving toward a newly focused item reported page motion for the whole of its own
dissolve, and a page-wide verdict therefore undithered the wash exactly while the wash was the thing
changing. Every focus pop, shelf scroll and press dip on the page did the same. `page_wash_dither`
is now the identity on its argument; Home answers it where it steps the snap dive and the hero
slide (position AND velocity, `screens/home/mod.rs`'s `Backdrop::still`), Detail from its scroll
velocity and its art ease's distance to target (`screens/detail/mod.rs`'s `art_still`), and
`PageGround` — the browsing grounds, which never have artwork over them — dithers unconditionally.
`ui::idle::underlay_moving` lost its last reader with it and is gone.

**Nothing here is a device measurement.** The expected cost is confined to frames on which the wash
now takes the noise that previously did not: the ~2.5M GPU cycles a frame the dither costs at full
screen are paid during a wash dissolve and under a focus pop, on top of whatever the page was doing.
The two numbers to take on the set are `fps:home-hero` and `fps:home-fold` (this section's 60 and
55/53 are the baseline to beat, and the fold is the scene where the artwork IS moving, so it should
not have changed at all), plus a captured still of a library page mid-dissolve to confirm the
staircase is gone. Both are pending; treat the fps claims in the table above as the last measured
state of this policy, not this one's.

(Superseded by the next section, which measured it — and then deleted `page_wash_dither` along
with Home's `Backdrop::still` and Detail's `art_still`.)

## 2026-09-19 (later): the wash at 60 — a branch, a multiply and a mix, and no gate at all

The addendum above was measured on the set, and it was worse than "confined to frames on which the
wash now takes the noise": PR1 (`ecab5d13`) took `fps:library-scroll` from 60 to 45 and
`fps:home-grid` from 56 to 51. The goal set for this pass was the owner's: every screen with the
wash at ~60 fps, the wash dithered on every frame including mid-animation, no global motion gate.
Every number below is the set (LG webOS 4.5, Mali-T820), `tests/run.py --fps` after `make deploy`
with the deployed binary's md5 checked against `pkg/nativejelly`, panel and sound off. GPU numbers
are `nativejelly-hwcnt=frame.ui` means per frame (fps in those legs is not a measurement); `mask`
is `nativejelly-drawmask=<class>`.

**Baseline, interleaved, two runs each** — fps median (loop robust_min):

| scene | main `a7083465` | PR1 `ecab5d13` |
|---|---|---|
| `home-hero` | 60 (57–59) | 60 (58) |
| `home-fold` | 54–54.5 (52–53) | 54 (52) |
| `home-grid` | 56 (55) | 50.5–52.5 (49) |
| `detail-transition` | 50 (46–48) | 50–51 (38–48) |
| `settings-root` | 60 (59–60) | 60 (59–60) |
| `library-scroll` | 60 (60) | 45 (44) |
| `search-type` | 58 / 46 (59) | 36 / 35 (45–46) |

**What it cost, and the four changes, in the order the census found them.**

1. *The tile coordinate was a highp multiply per fragment* (`gl_FragCoord.xy * (1.0/256.0)`), on
   every fragment of every dithered surface. It is linear in screen position, so the paired vertex
   shader now computes it (`glsl_vs_dithered!`, `#define NJ_DITHER_NC`, varying `v_dither_nc`)
   and the fetch reads the varying directly — `dither.glsl` cost rule 4. With it: library 45 → 50,
   search loop 45 → 50, grid 51 → 54, detail 50 → 56 (the last also carries the Detail TextView's
   wrap now going through the global `wrap_memo` — `Measure::live_font`, the one CPU term the
   `cpuprof` leg found above the budget there).
2. *The uniform `if (u_dither > 0.0)` in the prelude was not near-free.* Library scroll, same
   binary, same frames: branch in, 13.40M GPU / 22.75M ARITH, 49 fps; the same fetch unguarded,
   11.22M / 16.98M, 59 fps — **+5.8M arithmetic words a frame for one uniform branch**. The prelude
   is straight-line now; OFF is a different program (rule 1, rewritten). Library 50 → 59.5, search
   loop 50 → 57.
3. *Card interiors paid the rounded-rect SDF.* A card image's fragments more than `max(r,2)+1`
   inside its edge cannot touch the rim, so `fs_img.frag` returns the texel before `sdBox`
   (`u_inner`, `gfx::card_inner`). Fold 11.41M → 10.68M, grid 11.27M → 10.60M; library 60,
   fold 55, grid 56, detail 55.
4. *The wash mixed the field per fragment.* The drawmask census on that binary put the ambient
   class at 2.05M of the fold's 10.68M and a 16×16-cell mesh at −0.4M, so the field is now evaluated
   per VERTEX of `gfx::field_mesh` (16×16 cells, GL_TRIANGLES; bilinear error ≤ twist·h²/4, under
   half a code — pinned by a host test) and `fs_ambient.frag` is one varying plus the dither, no
   colour arithmetic at all. Fold 10.68M → 9.64M (58.5 fps), grid 9.73M (58), detail 60.

**Then the gate went.** Steps 1–4 were measured with PR1's art gate still in, and a mid-dive
capture of `nativejelly-homefoldosc` showed what that gate costs the picture: the band of wash under
the diving hero — wash-only, nothing over it — had an adjacent-pixel change fraction of **0.023**
(undithered treads) against ~0.70 dithered. `gfx::page_wash_dither`, `home::Backdrop::still` and
`detail::art_still` are deleted; `gfx::draw_ambient` and `Painter::ambient` take no dither flag.
Price: fold 9.64M → **10.25M** (+0.6M), grid 9.73M → 9.92M.

**The fold, after all of it** (mask census, GPU per frame, dither on every frame):

| masked | none | rect | grad | image | card | glass | ambient | rect+grad+image | all |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPU | 10.25M | 8.98M | 9.73M | 9.07M | 8.27M | 9.21M | 8.56M | 7.43M | 3.14M |

The 3.14M floor is the compositor's full-screen composite; the remaining 7.1M is spread over
every class with none above 2M (card 1.98M, ambient 1.69M, rect 1.27M, image 1.18M, glass
1.04M, grad 0.52M). There is no single term left whose removal buys the missing frame.

**Final**, binary `1e457d4e`, two runs — fps median (loop robust_min):

| scene | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| `home-hero` | 60 (59) | 60 (59) |
| `home-fold` | 57 (55) | 57 (55) |
| `home-grid` | 58 (56) | 57 (56) |
| `detail-transition` | 59 (54) | 58 (57) |
| `settings-root` | 60 (60) | 60 (60) |
| `library-scroll` | 60 (60) | 60 (58) |
| `search-type` | 45 (60) | 46 (59) |
| `person-page` | idle: robust_max 1 fps vs ceiling 5 (loop 61) | idle: robust_max 1 (loop 61) |
| `library-switch` | 24 (55) | 25 (56) |
| `home-acct-glass` | 58 (58) | 58 (58) |

`search-type`'s and `library-switch`'s fps medians count presents, which follow keystrokes and
menu steps rather than the render rate; their loop robust_min is the render measurement, and both
sit at 55–60 (main read 58 and 46 on two consecutive runs of the same binary).

**Mid-animation captures** (`tools/capture-screen.sh`, six 0.4 s apart during
`nativejelly-grid`+`nativejelly-homeosc` and during `nativejelly-homefoldosc`). Metric: fraction of
horizontally/vertically adjacent pixels that differ, on a wash-only region (luma std < 3); an
undithered field reads ~0.02, the dithered one ~0.5–0.7.

| capture | wash-only region | change h / v | smooth windows, min |
|---|---|---|---|
| fold, mid-dive | rows 862–900 × 500–1900 (std 0.45) | 0.703 / 0.709 | 0.538 |
| fold, mid-dive ×2 | left strip x 0–60 (std ~0.5) | ~0.70 | 0.53–0.57 |
| fold, late | — | — | 0.384 |
| grid, mid-scroll ×2 | left strip (std ~2.3) | 0.69–0.71 | 0.52–0.56 |
| grid, mid-scroll ×3 | cards over the fixed region | — | 0.31–0.41 |
| PR1 gate, fold mid-dive | rows 862–900 × 500–1900 | **0.023** | — |

**Unresolved.** `home-fold` is at 57 median / 55 loop robust_min on both runs against a 58 target,
and `home-grid` straddles it (58 then 57, robust_min 56 both times; main read 56 / 55), with the
wash dithered; the census above is the evidence — 10.25M cycles a frame against a 3.14M
floor, spread evenly over every class. Removing the gate cost it 58.5 → 57; keeping the gate is the
banding measured above, so that trade is not available. The next levers are structural, not
per-shader: extend the hero's one-pass ground (`fs_hero`) across the fold so the wash and the hero
scrim are one pass, and opaque card interiors that let the tiler skip the wash beneath them.
`ui::idle`'s settle frame no longer has a renderer term to settle and could be retired separately.

**2026-09-28, the first lever, taken in part.** The wash, the photograph dissolving over it and the
atmospheric ramp now draw as ONE opaque pass (`AmbientWash::draw_ground`, `fs_art_wash.frag`,
`vs_ambient.vert`'s `NJ_WASH_INK`), on Home's fold and Detail's still-over-ground; the corner wedge
stays its own layer. `poster-hero-grid-dive` went from 56.3 mean moving fps (seven runs, 54.9–57.1,
one below its 55 floor) to 58.6–60.7 (five runs). The whole-screen version — `fs_hero` extended
with the wash, the wedge and an inside test on every pixel — measured **49.1**: it moved ALU onto
pixels that had none, which on this arithmetic-bound GPU is the one thing that costs.

## 2026-09-19: transition hitches — `modal-100` and `push-100`, attributed

Both benches fail their 20 ms `bench_worst_ms` on base 727e4851. This section records where the
worst frames go, the two fixes that landed, and what is still over budget. Every number is from
the television, with the panel off and the sound muted. The "after" runs are 16-cycle (`modal`)
and 15-cycle (`push`) versions of the same benches, so their RSS lines cover only six cycles
after cycle 10 and cannot stand in for the 100-cycle RSS verdict.

**Instrument.** `diag::spans` (new) adds `spans=name:ms,…` to every `FRAMEDROP` line. The
dispatcher marks `prep`, `page`, `chrome`, `scrims` and `surf`. The framebuffer-0 `clear` carries
the driver's GPU throttle wait. Popover capture is `cap`. The underlay chain's full-screen copy
is `fieldcopy`, and its 480-byte `glReadPixels` is `fieldread`. A repeated name is summed and
suffixed `xN`.

| bench (worst_ms per cycle) | p50 | p95 | max | RSS last − cycle 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modal-100, base (100 cycles) | 63.9 | 84.3 | 131.2 | +17060 kB |
| modal, Home fix + read one frame late (16 cycles) | 42.6 | 73.7 | 73.7 | +5580 kB |
| modal, Home fix + read two frames late (16 cycles) | 52.1 | 99.3 | 99.3 | +5604 kB |
| push-100, base (100 cycles) | 33.4 | 52.4 | 109.7 | +648 kB |
| push, after (15 cycles) | 33.5 | 101.5 | 101.5 | −1924 kB |

**What the modal open frame cost on base.** The open frame took 60–69 ms. Of that, 26–37 ms was
`fieldread`: `ModalUnderlay` read the underlay field back on the same frame that queued the
chain, so the read waited for the whole frame to draw. `clear` took 12–13 ms and `page` (the
host capture) 14 ms. On Settings, `surf` took 50.9 ms, most of it `RouteGround`'s own synchronous
latch.

**Fix 1: a settled Home no longer presents forever.** The hero auto-advance reported
`PresentEvent::Motion` on every tick while it counted down. As a result, a settled Home kept
presenting full frames indefinitely. Each of those frames cost about 24 ms of GPU, and the next
transition paid for the backlog. The countdown is a timer. It is ticked on every loop
iteration, and the flip itself wakes the gate. Regression test:
`a_settled_hero_counting_down_lets_the_gate_close_and_still_flips`, observed red with "asked
for 500 presents".

**Fix 2: the field read is split from the reduction.** `gfx::field_kick` queues the chain, using
the host's `Held::Page` snapshot as its source when there is one, which also saves the
full-screen copy. `gfx::field_collect` reads the ticket later. Until the read lands, the modal
keeps the loop turning and holds off the host's `Held::Ground` stage. Waiting one drawn frame was
not enough to make the read free: the collect still spent 11–25 ms in `fieldread`, because the
GPU runs more than a frame behind. At two frames the read costs 0.1–0.4 ms, but the collect
frame's total grew from 42–45 ms to 50–57 ms, almost none of it inside a span. The GPU is
saturated through the whole ramp, so the extra frame only adds to the backlog, and the wait
moves to the first unspanned framebuffer-0 draw. Both runs were back to back, and Home's frames
between cycles cost the same in each (median 25.0 and 25.2 ms), so the difference is not the
set. The bench grades the worst frame, so `FIELD_READ_LAG_SWAPS` stays at one.

**What is still over 20 ms, by cause.**

- **Home's steady GPU cost.** With the modal bench running, Home draws two page passes per frame
  (`pagex2`), and the throttle `clear` waits 17–20 ms. Every modal cycle starts on that backlog.
  This is the ambient lane's territory (the Home ground and its blur source pass), not a
  transition mechanism.
- **Settings' first visible frame.** Settings' `RouteGround` is not drawn while its opacity is 0,
  so its first latch happens on a visible frame and falls back to the synchronous read
  (`fieldcopy:2–9`, `fieldread:20–30`, inside `surf:47`). Deferring that read means drawing a
  frame or two without the sampled ground at low alpha, which is a visual change. It has not been
  made.
- **Push (`detail` and `library`).** These show no one-off hitch. Frames are sustained at 22–25
  ms: `clear` 11–18 ms plus `page` 21 ms on Detail, and two page passes on Library throughout
  the push spring. Only fill-rate work on those pages can fix that. The Detail first-cycle
  outlier (101.5 ms) is the cold artwork load.

**Ambient scenes on the "two frames late" build.** That build differs from the landed one only in the read lag. No base run was taken on the same day. The
reference is the latest figures in this document.

| scene | result |
|---|---|
| home-hero | PASS, median 60 fps |
| home-fold | PASS, median 54 fps |
| home-grid | FAIL on loop floor: robust_min 49 against 50; fps median 34 against floor 20 |
| detail-transition | PASS, median 50 fps |
| settings-root | PASS, 60 fps |
| modal-ramp | PASS, worst robust_max 58.7 ms against 75 |
| item-menu | PASS, loop 60 |
| home-acct-glass | PASS, median 56 fps (60 in the 2026-09-04 table) |

## 2026-09-19 (later): the modal open, one frame at a time — still over budget

All numbers come from the television, with the panel off and the sound muted. They are from
`TMP-modal-short`, a 16-cycle copy of `fps:modal-100` that cycles through Settings, the account
menu, the item menu and About. Because the run is short, its RSS line covers only six cycles after
cycle 10.

| build (worst_ms per cycle) | p50 | p95 | max | RSS last − cycle 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| start of this lane (ed3801b4 + FBO capture + fence) | 40.1 | 75.9 | 75.9 | +9.7 MB |
| + frozen page never reads its ground, read once the dim is seen | 40.1 | 61.7 | 61.7 | +4.7 MB |
| + separable `texture_rgba` | 37.2 | 62.5 | 62.5 | +8.6 MB |
| + the appear spring held for the capture frame | 31.1 | 71.6 | 71.6 | +8.6 MB |

The max figure is Settings' cold first cycle each time. The RSS figure moves by ±4 MB between
back-to-back runs of the same build, so six cycles cannot settle a leak verdict.

**What landed, and why.**

- **The host page renders straight INTO the snapshot.** `FrameCache::render_into` does this
  instead of drawing to framebuffer 0 and then copying it out mid-frame. The underlay field reads
  its fence-guarded ticket (`egl::fence`) only after the GPU has signalled, so `fieldread` is never
  a drain.
- **A frozen page never reads its ground** (`gfx::may_read_ground`). Every thirtieth frame of a
  modal held over Home, the tab-track and Hero-row samplers issued a synchronous `glReadPixels`.
  That drained the GPU for 21 ms on a page whose pixels could not have changed.
  Test: `a_frozen_page_answers_its_ground_from_the_last_reading`, observed red (SIGSEGV, reaching
  `glReadPixels`).
- **The field is read on the first frame a dim is SEEN** (`draw_scrims_on`, `RouteGround::draw_host`).
  Before this, it was read on the frame the surface was presented.
- **`texture_rgba` is separable and bit-identical.** It computes the x pass once per (grid row,
  texel column) and runs only the y pass per texel. Its CPU time on the dim-latch frame fell from
  7.5–8.6 ms to 3.5–4.5 ms. What remains is mostly 5,760 `powf` in `gfx::enc`.
  Test: `a_separable_texture_is_reconstruct_to_the_bit`.
- **The appear spring holds at 0 for one tick after `present`** (`PopoverMotion::hold`). The frame
  that renders the host into its snapshot therefore carries no dim, no reduction and no panel ramp.
  The ramp is the same curve, one frame later.
  Test: `a_presented_surface_holds_at_zero_for_one_frame_then_ramps`, observed red.

**What is still over 20 ms: GPU backlog at the open.** The graded worst frame of almost every
cycle is the third frame after the open. It waits 22–37 ms (`tpp`) for a buffer while doing
3–6 ms of its own CPU work. `main.ui` HWCNT per frame (About):

| frame | GPU cycles |
|---|---|
| capture | 11.2 M |
| next | 5.5 M |
| next | 12.1 M |
| steady | 7.7 M |

Home is 8.7 M a frame, and 3.0 M of every frame is the compositor floor
(`drawmask=all`, the 2026-09-02 section). The steady modal frame is already close to a vsync
of GPU, so the open's roughly 5.8 M excess has no headroom to drain into. With
`drawmask=all` the same bench grades p50 17.5 and 12 of 16 cycles pass, which shows that the
remaining cost is the app's own draw work, not presentation pacing.

Leads not yet taken:
- Serve the Held::Ground stage from the settle frame. It never fired in these runs.
- Price the steady frame's 4.5 M app cycles class by class. A `drawmask` leg does NOT change the
  HWCNT legs of `--graphics-profile`, so use `frame.ui` production A/B runs.
- Replace `enc` with an exact threshold search.
- Handle Settings' cold first open. Its `surf` is 46–56 ms on the CPU.

`push-100` was not worked in this lane.

## 2026-09-19 (modal-60 lane): who waits for the capture — `modal-100` 100/100 → 23/100 over

**Why `Held::Ground` never fires.** `host::ground_drawn` is reached only through `Popover::panel`.
Its only caller is `decision_alert`. Every container surface (item menu, account menu, About,
tracks, alt sources, person bio, library menu) calls `widgets::panel_ground` directly. The stage
would not help the bench anyway: a settled modal stops presenting, so every graded frame is a ramp
frame.

**Where the open's cost went.** A trace with every frame logged (`nativejelly-framedrop=1`) of the
16-cycle bench showed the pattern. The capture frame's CPU is short, 4–10 ms, because the CPU runs
a frame ahead. Its GPU is a whole host render plus the composite. The second presented frame after
it then waited 25–35 ms for a buffer, with under 1 ms of spans.

`drawmask` pricing on the same bench (cycles over 20 ms, of 16):

| leg | over |
|---|---|
| none | 15 |
| field | 14 |
| glass | 15 |
| ambient | 16 |
| image,text | 7 |
| ambient,image,text,shadow,card,grad | 8 |

So the cost is the host page's own content, rendered once into the snapshot, not any modal
feature. It cannot be made cheaper per frame. What changed is who waits for it.

**What landed (branch `perf/modal-60`).**

1. **A capture is not followed by a present until the GPU has it.**
   - After a capture frame's swap, `gfx::snapshot_frame_end` inserts a fence.
   - `snapshot_frame_begin` latches whether that fence is still in flight. It is bounded by
     `SNAPSHOT_DEFER_MAX` = 4 frames, and nothing is ever deferred without fences.
   - `app::run`'s present gate skips those frames without consuming the idle gate's damage.
   - `PopoverMotion::tick_gated` keeps a held surface at appear 0 through them. The ramp therefore
     starts on an empty GPU queue, while the panel shows the capture frame, which is the unchanged
     page.
   - Tests: `a_snapshot_in_flight_defers_presents_for_a_bounded_number_of_frames` and
     `a_held_surface_stays_at_zero_while_its_snapshot_is_in_flight`, both observed red.
2. **The field is queued on the capture frame.**
   - Both readers used to kick the reduction on the first ramp frame: `ModalStack::draw_scrims_on`
     and `RouteGround::draw_host` (`ground_reads_host`). That work was the backlog the frame after
     it paid (20–24 ms).
   - The reduction is now waited out with the capture.
   - Test: `the_page_is_read_on_the_capture_frame_and_not_on_a_held_frame_without_one`, observed
     red.
3. **The field read runs at the frame head.**
   - `gfx::field_frame_begin` runs before `draw`, under the same due rule.
   - `field_collect` no longer touches GL. A mid-frame `glReadPixels` ended framebuffer 0's render
     pass.
   - Test: `a_field_collect_answers_only_what_the_frame_head_read`.
4. **`gfx::enc_u8`.** The texture quantisation uses 255 thresholds, bisected once against the
   formula, instead of 5760 `powf` per latch. It is identical to the formula bit for bit:
   `the_quantised_encode_is_the_powf_encode_to_the_bit`.

**Results** (television, panel off):

| | 16-cycle bench, over 20 ms | p50 | `modal-100` |
|---|---|---|---|
| before (3a3e640e) | 15/16 | 31.4 ms | not run in this lane |
| + fence gate | 5/16 | 19.2 ms | |
| + capture-frame kick | 5/16 | 17.7 ms | 23/100 over, p50 18.2, drift −8.8 |

Regression scenes on the final binary:
- `fps:item-menu`, `settings-root` and `home-acct-glass` pass at 60.
- `modal-ramp` passes with worst robust_max 31.8 ms against its ceiling of 75.

**Still over, by attribution** (`modal-100`, final binary):

- **Settings' cold first open**, cycle 1: 91 ms, with `surf` 54 ms of CPU on its first draw. Later
  opens are about 5 ms. This is not yet attributed inside the draw.
- **Item-menu capture frames with `page` 28–33 ms**: cycles 3, 27, 99. The page pass blocks inside
  the snapshot render. It coincides with Home's own texture traffic.
- **About 15 cycles at 20.1–24.3 ms.** The steady ramp frame is about a vsync of GPU, so any extra
  CPU on a frame shows. Examples:
  - the field adopt, `scrims` 2.4–2.8 ms;
  - a hero backdrop upload landing on an open frame, `prepare` 14 ms (`up=1 px=922320`).

**RSS is not a leak.** `rss growth(last−cycle10)` = 15.5 MB fails the gate. The texture ledger
(`tex=` on every cycle line) explains it:
- Home's hero rotation (`HERO_AUTO_S` = 8 s) keeps running between opens. Each new hero adds a
  1280x720 backdrop (3600 kB) to the bounded `TexCache`.
- The ledger reaches 132 textures / 76 MB by cycle 31.
- It then stays flat to cycle 100: RSS is 112.4 ± 0.7 MB from cycle 30 on.
- Pinning `nativejelly-heroidx` does not stop the rotation. The ledger sequence was identical with it.

**Dismissals.** The first frame of every dismissal is 25–29 M GPU cycles and 14,298 tiles (HWCNT,
previous lane). That is roughly seven full-screen passes. The bench does not grade it, but it is a
real hitch.

## 2026-09-19 (later): `push-100`, frame by frame — the ground samplers, and what is left

All numbers come from the television with the panel off and the sound muted, on the full
100-cycle `fps:push-100` unless a row says otherwise. Base is 3a3e640e. The attribution runs used
a temporary 12-cycle copy of the bench with a per-frame trace (frame index since the push, total,
`nav::page_alpha`) beside the `FRAMEDROP` spans. That trace was not committed.

| build (worst_ms per cycle) | Detail p50 | Detail over 20 | Person over 20 | Library over 20 | all p50 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| base 3a3e640e | 28.3 | 34 / 34 | 6 / 33 | 9 / 33 | 19.7 | 114.7 |
| + async ground probe (a721d229) | 20.9 | 22 / 34 | 7 / 33 | 11 / 33 | 19.7 | 100.5 |

**The page dip is not a cross-fade.** `PageDip` draws one page per frame: the outgoing page fades
to the app ground, the op applies at the floor, and the incoming page fades up. The dip frames
themselves were mostly 6–18 ms. The graded worst frame of a warm Detail cycle was almost never in
the dip. It was in the settled page, which presents every frame because the wash dithers every
frame.

**What failed every warm Detail cycle: the Hero row's ground read.** `sample_control_ground` ran a
synchronous `glReadPixels` once every thirty frames. That frame cost 27–29 ms: `clear` ~11 ms, plus
~15 ms of GPU drain and reduction inside `page`. It is exactly the period of the spikes: frames 16,
46 and 76 of one cycle, and 29 and 59 of another.

**Fix: a ground reading never waits on the frame** (`gfx::GroundProbe`, cadence in the pure
`gfx::ProbeCadence`). A due call copies the tap boxes GPU-side into a small probe target and
inserts a fence. `gfx::ground_probes_frame_end` reads the target right after the swap, once the
fence has signalled. The sampler's next call reduces it. Both samplers take this path: the tab
track's `sample_ground` and the Hero row's `sample_control_ground`. Two intermediate steps were
measured and rejected:

- **Reading the probe mid-page, at the sampler's next call.** `gndread` fell to 0.2 ms, but the
  frame still ran ~12 ms over its neighbours.
- **Reading it between frames.** That frame was still ~12 ms over. The cause was the reduction
  itself: 5 × 49 × 49 × 3 = 36,015 `powf` on the render thread. `lin_u8` is a 256-entry table and
  is bit-identical to the `powf` mean (`the_u8_ground_mean_is_the_powf_mean_to_the_bit`).
  `gndmean` is now 0.5–1.6 ms.

The kick (`gndkick`) costs 1.8–2.7 ms of CPU. The answer lands one or two frames later than before.
Both samplers refuse to read while the page dips (`may_sample_control_ground`, the track's
`settled`), so no mid-transition frame changes. On the 12-cycle bench, warm cycles 4–12 then graded
17.0–21.4 ms, against 17.0–35.1 ms before.

The modal lane's 27606a23 moves the underlay FIELD's read to the frame head. It is the same idea
on a different chain. The two merge cleanly (`git merge-tree`), and nothing about the field is
changed here.

**What is still over 20 ms, by cause:**

- **Detail's steady GPU cost, in bursts.** A warm cycle can fall to 30 Hz for 4–9 consecutive
  frames: `clear` 26–28 ms, `page` 31–32 ms, the page's own CPU 4.5 ms. Nothing in the app changes
  on those frames. The settled Detail frame sits within about a millisecond of the vsync on the
  GPU, so any disturbance tips it into two-vsync frames until the backlog drains. That disturbance
  can be a probe kick's render-pass split, a texture arriving, or GPU clock scaling. This is now the
  main warm-cycle failure (22 of 34 Detail cycles). Only fill-rate work on the settled Detail
  frame can fix it. Price it class by class with production `drawmask` A/B runs.
- **The cold first cycle of each page (cycle 1 Detail ~100 ms, the first Person 30–45 ms, the
  first Library 38–41 ms).** On the cold Detail frame (106.8 ms in total), 47 new strings each paid
  a `TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended` (24.7 ms together) and a texture upload (`upload_rgba`, 26.2 ms
  together, ~0.55 ms each). The rating row took 22.4 ms, the identity line 15.7 ms and the cast
  section 23.9 ms. Font opens are not the cost: 0.7–1.1 ms each, three on that frame. No per-string
  path gets such a frame under 20 ms. Rendering the strings over several frames under a per-frame
  budget would; the strings would then appear over the first frames of the fade-in. That is a
  visual decision for the owner and has not been made.
- **Home's run-up into the push.** Home draws two page passes per frame (the tab-glass blur source
  pass) at `clear` 17–20 ms. The floor frame of the push (the first Detail frame) inherits that
  backlog: `clear` 19–38 ms.

**The other gated scenes on a721d229** (same session, after the push-100 run):

| scene | result |
|---|---|
| detail-transition | PASS, median 59 fps, robust_min 52 |
| home-detail-nav | PASS, loop median 60 |
| library-scroll | PASS, 60 fps |
| home-hero | PASS, 60 fps |
| home-fold | PASS, median 58 fps |
| home-grid | PASS, loop robust_min 57 |

This is not a same-day A/B. The base figures in the table two sections up predate 3a3e640e.

## 2026-09-19 (r3)

**Host-side diagnosis and fixes; no new television measurements.** Inputs were
`/tmp/stress-r3/modal-100-frames.txt` and `/tmp/stress-r3/push-100-frames.txt` on
`perf/stress-r3`. The cycle lines reproduce 17/100 modal failures (Settings 8, item menu 4,
account menu 3, About 2) and 42/100 push failures (Detail 25, Library 12, Person 5).
The files contain 312 modal FRAMEDROPs, all on Home, and 116 push FRAMEDROPs (Home 61,
Detail 46, Library 8, Person 1). Counting every line in these supplied files gives 189 modal
frames with all of `clearx2,pagex2,chromex2,scrimsx2,surfx2`, rather than the request's 174;
the duplicate-pass finding is present. There are 227 modal `pagex2` frames overall. Counts
are calls within one frame, not a claim that every draw primitive survives the host freeze.

**Why the second pass survives a frozen host.** `app/run.rs::draw` prepared the top track
whenever the page wore tab chrome, even with a modal up. `TabBand::prepare` fed the shared
`DynamicClock` the entire frame's `idle::present_moving() || present_dirty()`. Surface
animation therefore invalidated the chrome blur. `gfx::blur_direct_region` saw an invalid
snapshot and the previous frame's requested region, and `blur_snapshot_direct` called the
same `page` closure into its small FBO. That closure calls `Dispatcher::draw_with_glass`;
`ui/dispatch.rs::draw_with` draws pages/chrome, scrims, AND modal surfaces. It is not a
page-only source callback.

`ui/popover.rs::host::page_pass` serves `Held::Page` as a cached quad and freezes page
primitives, but the dispatcher's surface scopes call `host::live`, which lifts the freeze.
Both `page_pass` and `live` also invalidate `Held::Ground` during a source pass. Worse,
`gfx::blur_invalidate` invalidates that ground before the pass even starts. A modal whose
host reached the ground stage can consequently lose its snapshot and redraw the page too.
A fresh page capture deliberately refuses `FrameCache::render_into` inside a source FBO;
the visible pass must capture it instead. Thus the cache is not a guard against a second
whole-dispatch traversal, and the blur's invalidation can destroy the cache's benefit.

**Shared fixes.** `ui/frame/glass.rs::GlassPlan` now owns the source's visibility and motion
verdict. `run.rs` supplies `Dispatcher::surface_up()` (including entrance and exit phases)
and samples page/navigation motion before the shared chrome steps. Covered chrome does not
prepare/invalidate the track or experimental tile source, and the loop does not enter the
source callback while a modal is visible. Modal fields and foreground rendering retain their
ordinary visible pass. On an uncovered page, chrome's own density/strip/chip springs still
animate, but no longer invalidate what is behind them. Actual page motion, one final settle
frame, and discrete damage still refresh; existing activation and region-miss handling remain
in force. Returning from a different route therefore still gets a fresh source before reuse.
This is not a promise to skip the first pop-back frame or a still-changing page transition.

**Elimination versus cadence.** The earlier experiment in this document measured 46 fps with
source work every present, 35 without glass, and 36 at one-in-eight. The source pass paces the
GPU; its exact driver/DVFS explanation remains unproven. We have not changed the cadence for
changing pages (`DEFAULT_DYNAMIC_PERIOD` remains 1), nor disabled glass globally. We eliminate
an invisible source under a modal, and reuse a valid source when only its foreground chrome
moves. This avoids redundant work without temporally undersampling changing artwork. It still
changes GPU submission on the eliminated frames and needs a television A/B before any speedup
or bench pass can be claimed. The ambient wash's per-frame dithering is unchanged.

**A second shared defect in the push path: text recording cleared the live framebuffer.**
The dispatcher's PageDip prewarm drew the pending screen with `Painter::recording`, but Home,
Library and Detail call raw `gfx::frame_clear` outside that painter. The recording pass could
therefore erase the outgoing page and issue another clear. Eight Detail FRAMEDROPs have
`clearx2` with only one `page` span, consistent with this path; that shape is different from
the glass source's two page spans. `gfx::without_frame_clear` now suppresses both opaque and
transparent frame clears while the pending screen records, restoring its state on nesting
and unwind. It preserves the independent modal freeze. The dispatcher also runs text prewarm
only on the visible pass: a source callback previously recorded and drained a second 6 ms
budget in the same presented frame. The text budget itself and its admission rules are unchanged.

**Remaining classes, and limits of attribution:**

- Settings' recurring failed cycles are 21, 49, 53, 69, 73, 81 and 89, plus cold cycle 1.
  Adjacent return-to-Home frames at file lines 110, 224, 284, 307, 343 and 378 have single
  `clear` calls around 14–15 ms and chrome around 5–7 ms, not duplicate surface draws.
  Cycle 81 additionally has a 22.1 ms frame (line 344) with page 0.5 ms, surface 2.3 ms,
  but draw 20.6 ms: the named nested spans do not cover all host-cache/driver work.
  Cold cycle 1 is 69.2 ms with surface 53.4 ms. Covered-source invalidation is fixed for
  the whole family, but these samples do not prove a Settings-local defect or identify
  another safe optimization. No speculative change to Settings' ground or text was made.
- Detail has 46 slow frames, all single-page-pass; 43 have at least 10 ms in `clear` and
  44 have no uploads. One warm sample is total 32.7, draw 31.5, clear 29.9 ms. These are
  consistent with the previously measured GPU/back-buffer backlog, not evidence that the
  page's CPU work or a synchronous read is responsible. The redundant recording clears
  above are fixed, but ordinary clears, fill-rate, probe timing and driver scheduling have
  not been blindly altered. Cold Detail is 88.5 ms (prepare 13.2, page 73.8); three Detail
  frames have prepare over 10 ms. Existing prewarm remains budgeted and does not guarantee
  that all cold strings/assets fit before first paint.
- All eight slow Library frames have `pagex2`; seven have no uploads. The shared source
  policy addresses the subset caused by chrome-only motion, and the prewarm fix prevents
  duplicate preparation during transitions. The logs do not contain a page-motion verdict,
  so they cannot prove that all eight source passes were unnecessary. Changing content
  still requires a source. Five have at least 10 ms in `clear`.
- Home in push has 24 `pagex2` frames and 35 with a single `page` span in the complete file
  (rather than the request's 31). Fifty-six have at least 10 ms in `clear`. The static-source
  fix applies on return, but single-pass backlog is not itself a duplicated-pass defect.
- Person has one logged slow frame: total 23.1, page 21.5, no uploads. The five failed
  Person-labelled cycles cannot all be assigned to Person rendering: the bench measures
  only its Measuring phase, while FRAMEDROP also records the waiting/return intervals.
  Likewise, nearby Settings log lines are context, not exact cycle-frame joins. A cycle's
  target is not necessarily the route of its worst frame. No Person-specific change was made.

**Verification.** Before each change, host tests reproduced covered-source eligibility,
chrome-only source invalidation, the missing final settle refresh, recording clears (including
nested/unwinding scopes), and duplicate source-pass text preparation as failures. The fixes
make those predicates pass without a GL context; an additional test preserves discrete-damage
refresh. Host checks cannot establish pixels, GPU pacing, or the 20 ms cycle limit. No TV,
SSH, deployment, private configuration files, grading rules, ceilings or bench exemptions were
used or changed. The final targeted run (`ui::`, `gfx::`, shared chrome/navigation tests) passed
743 tests; the shipping `cargo +nightly check --lib --no-default-features` passed too. An earlier
full host run passed 3,630 tests, ignored one and failed 126 network tests: 123 explicitly report
sandbox permission errors, and three fail in connection/fixture setup. It is not a full green gate.
No ARM build or device result is claimed. A manual review of the changed prose and render boundaries
found no new FFI, symbol, linkage or firmware ABI change.

## 2026-09-19: live backdrop sources follow the layer stack

This supersedes the r3 `cover_page(surface_up())` gate and page-wide
`note_page_motion`/`source_changed` verdict. Those APIs, widget prepare calls and widget-local
source-pass exclusions have been removed. The live cadence clock and its `glasshz` override
have also been removed: a changed visible source refreshes on every presented frame. The
synthetic load dial still owns its separate experimental cadence.

`ui/frame/backdrop.rs` is the single policy owner, held by `GlassPlan`. A declaration traversal
of the ordinary painter records this frame's glass rectangles and exact, ordered draw arguments
(including transforms, clip bounds, material values, text bytes and texture upload revisions).
It submits no visual primitives and spends no second text-prewarm budget. Source identity is
the ordered commands intersecting each sampling footprint strictly below that glass, including
the blur/lens margin. This replaces the page-wide motion verdict: a last settling position is a
changed command just like an input, navigation or asset landing; foreground commands and changes
outside the sampled region do not invalidate the source. The identity uses exact values, not a
hash whose collision could silently declare a changed region unchanged. Each retained source
keeps the description of its captured prefix, so an unfurl into already-captured, unchanged pixels
reuses that source too. Lower-glass dependencies are regional, not a band-wide revision counter.
A texture re-upload
changes its identity even if the GL name and dimensions remain the same.

The dispatcher walks page, chrome, dims, surfaces and the lifted opener with an explicit z
ceiling. An inline glass advances the layer boundary; primitive submission stops at that boundary
inside a source traversal. A widget no longer needs to know it is being drawn as a source.
The stack publishes geometry for held Page/Ground images, an opaque route's replacement ground,
and full-alpha dims. A completely covered glass neither refreshes nor draws. Multiple rectangular
blockers can jointly cover it. A held ground stores the actual last included z boundary, so glass
added inside a modal's ground is covered too; it is not assumed to be below the first surface.
A replacement between a source and lower commands also hides
those commands' damage. Source/declaration traversals preserve the held-ground draw ledger;
only the visible traversal advances its capture/readback lifecycle. Each source walk has its own
once-per-prefix snapshot ledger; it neither consumes the visible ledger nor repaints a frozen quad
over lower live foreground. Layers above the stored frozen boundary remain live.

Captures are coalesced **per z band**, never across incompatible depths. Disjoint chrome surfaces
share one capture covering the union declared in the current frame, including activation; the
empty gap between them is not a sampler for validity. Overlap splits the band automatically.
Independent bands retain the measured quarter-resolution direct-source path. A band whose
footprint intersects lower glass captures the visible framebuffer prefix instead: that prefix
contains the lower glass's actual composite, including its sharp rim, and cannot contain the
upper glass or a later layer. This deliberately avoids rendering a lower glass with an approximate
rim into an upper source. All bands reuse the same blur scratch chain and retain only compact
half-resolution output textures; those outputs are counted in the render-set budget and released
before the GL context shuts down. A failed inline capture cannot retry after another member has
painted its fallback into the band. Material choice stays independent of capture success, so the
same logical surfaces participate in declaration and visible walks. Existing renderer refusals
(video planes and disabled/masked glass) apply before declaration as well.

The earlier result remains a constraint: 46 fps refreshing every changing present versus 35
without glass and 36 at one-in-eight. The source pass **paces** this Mali GPU; the driver/DVFS
explanation remains unproven. This mechanism skips only occluded or unchanged sources. It does
not undersample changing underlays. The extra declaration traversal, retained-output copy and
per-band storage are deliberate costs for structural correctness; the prefix-copy path for
stacked glass also needs a device comparison before any performance claim. Host-only tests cover
the layer walk, geometry, validity, union scheduling, upload identity and frozen-host bookkeeping.
No television was contacted and no new GPU measurements or visual verification are claimed here.

## 2026-09-19: two declaration-traversal costs, `modal-100`/`push-100` still regressed after the fix

TV A/B (`integ/stress@e8c016dc` vs `perf/stress-r3@394ff9ea`, same session, interleaved,
md5-verified deploys) showed `fps:modal-100` cycles-over-20ms at A 16/15 vs B 31/34, and
`fps:push-100` at A 43 vs B 57, with B's slow frames shifting toward `route=detail`. Two real
costs in the general mechanism above, both now fixed; a third, smaller one remains open.

**Cause 1 — `text_value` recorded one `u64` per BYTE.** Every discovered frame's exact-draw-
description walk re-records every live text primitive regardless of whether it changed (rule #5:
every changed visible source refreshes each present, so validity is compared every frame). The
byte-per-word encoding meant a Settings row list or a Detail synopsis + cast bios paid an 8x
`Vec<u64>` inflation on allocation, push and later `Paint::eq` comparison. Fixed by packing 8
bytes per `u64` word (`text_value`, `backdrop.rs`): same exact-identity semantics (`values ==
values` still means byte-for-byte equal, no hash, no collision risk, no truncation), 6.69x fewer
words and ~1.64x less construction time in a standalone `rustc -O` micro-benchmark. Regression
test: `text_value_packs_bytes_instead_of_one_word_per_byte`.

**Cause 2 — the surfaces loop declared into a band nothing ever reads.** `dispatch.rs::draw_with`
draws `nav.modals.surfaces` (Settings/AccountMenu/ItemMenu/About's own content) unconditionally in
both the no-GL discovery pass and the real draw pass — unlike the page/chrome/dim/scrims block,
which the existing `host_render != Replaced` gate already skips correctly. But no glass entry is
ever created at or above `Z::surface(0)`: every `Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP.backdrop(...)` call site
sits inside the CHROME layer scope (grep-verified against the whole crate), and popovers stood off
the blur chain entirely on 2026-09-19 (`docs/backdrop-blur-profiling.md`, above) — they use the
frozen-host snapshot in `popover.rs`, which feeds its own synthetic `Paint` straight into
`Sources::begin`, never through `paint()`. So every primitive a surface declared was allocated,
recorded, sorted and scanned for nothing: no current or (by this architecture) foreseeable
consumer ever reads a `Paint` above that boundary. Fixed with two layered checks: `paint()` is the
authoritative gate (returns before allocating the `Paint`/pushing to `sources.paints` once
`w.current >= Z::surface(0)`), and `Painter::declare` has a fast pre-check (`recording_excluded`)
so the caller skips building the primitive's `Vec<u64>` — and, for text, the `text_value` packing
above — in the first place, rather than building it only to have `paint` discard it. A
`debug_assert` at the `declare` short-circuit trips immediately if a future glass command is ever
declared up there, rather than silently starving it of data. Regression tests:
`content_at_or_above_the_surfaces_band_is_never_recorded` (red without the fix: recorded 3 paints
instead of 1) and `a_glass_command_above_the_surfaces_band_trips_the_debug_assert`.

Both fixes are inside the general mechanism: no special case for a screen, no ceiling change, no
exemption from the "every changed source refreshes each present" rule, and the ambient wash still
dithers every frame. All 27 `backdrop::` tests and the full `cargo test --lib` (3777 passed, 1
ignored, 0 failed) stay green; `cargo +nightly check --lib --no-default-features` stays clean.

**Re-measured on the TV** (same session, `com.beb.nativejelly.debug`, panel off, muted, md5-verified
deploys), `fps:modal-100`:

| build | run | cycles>20ms | p50 | p95 | max | rss growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A `e8c016dc` | 1 | 13 | 18.2 | 21.5 | 73.7 | +76 kB |
| A `e8c016dc` | 2 | 15 | 18.0 | 22.8 | 65.0 | +116 kB |
| B, `text_value` fix only | 1 | 36 | 19.5 | 28.4 | 71.4 | -8 kB |
| B, both fixes | 1 | 31 | 19.3 | 21.8 | 75.5 | 0 kB |

The surfaces-band fix alone brought `about` and `item-menu` to parity with or better than A (A:
1/3 over20 vs B-both: 3/2), and `p95` is now inside A's own run-to-run spread (21.5–22.8). It did
not close the gap on `settings`/`account-menu` (A: 6/3 over20 vs B-both: 16/10): B's per-cycle
worst frame for those two targets sits a fairly constant ~1-1.5 ms above A's (comparing the two
runs' worst-frame distributions directly, not just the over20 count), which is small enough to be
a genuine third cost rather than the doubled-walk shape of causes 1-2. `push-100` was not
re-measured after these fixes (time budget); the `route=detail` shift the original A/B lane
reported is still unexplained.

**Open hypothesis for the residual `settings`/`account-menu` gap.** Both targets freeze their host
(`Style::Sheet`/`Opaque`, `HostUpdate::Frozen`, `surface_policy` → `HostRender::Cached`, not
`Replaced`), so `dispatch.rs::draw_with`'s page/chrome block still runs every frame — it is only
`Replaced` that the existing gate skips. `gfx.rs`'s `may_read_ground` doc (`page_frozen`) states
plainly that a frozen page's "draw produces no pixels": the low-level GL calls are suppressed, but
the full Home widget tree (layout, string formatting, every `Painter::declare` call) still walks,
both during the no-GL discovery pass (to record, same as causes 1-2) and during the real draw pass
(to reach the point where the suppressed GL call would have been). Whether this walk is new cost
introduced by this mechanism, or an existing cost the r3 special case (`8014abc5`) happened to
avoid by blocking the chrome glass source pass while a modal is up, is not yet established — that
special case was never TV-measured, so there is no baseline to compare against directly. The next
worker should: (1) confirm with a host micro-benchmark or `spans=` breakdown whether `page`/
`chrome` span time under a frozen host in B is larger per-frame than under A's mechanism, not just
present in both; (2) if so, look at whether `paint()`'s `Z::surface(0)` exclusion in this change
generalizes to "recording content covered by a frozen-host boundary is also dead," the same way it
did for the surfaces band — `held_ceiling()`'s synthetic `Layer` already carries the frozen
boundary `z`, so the same shape of fix (skip recording, not skip drawing) may apply there too,
but it needs the same care this change gave the surfaces band: prove no live glass ever reads
content below a frozen boundary before excluding it, the same way `Z::surface(0)` was proven safe
here by grepping every `DYNAMIC_BACKDROP.backdrop()` call site.

## 2026-09-19: stress-v3 visible dependencies and held-page hand-off

The general `GlassPlan` path now treats discovery as strictly descriptive: control-ground probes
refuse discovery/source walks, probe cadence advances by presented frames rather than calls, and
excluded text is not measured. `FRAMEDROP` includes a `disc` span for this walk.

Capture scheduling now follows the visible prefix. A retained lower glass covered by a frozen or
opaque replacement is not an upper band's dependency; the upper band directly replays the frozen
composite and current dim, while the covered lower source remains untouched. Held PageDip image
content is filtered once at full alpha. Animated alpha is applied over the constant app ground by
the glass composite shader, so alpha-only frames schedule no new filter job; geometry or snapshot
revision still invalidates.

PageDip no longer releases solely because its 140 ms In ramp ended. The destination continues to
tick and load behind the held image until page-owned motion and first-frame resource work are both
quiet, with a documented 600 ms maximum hold. It then takes one settled replacement capture
off-screen, presents that image, and switches to matching live output on the next frame. The old
live-page-plus-full-screen-image dissolve is gone. `FRAMEDROP` now carries
`dip=out|hold|in|held|live` for phase attribution.

These changes were host-tested only in this lane. No television was contacted, so the requested
push-100/modal-100/deep-100 ≤20 ms outcome remains a prediction until the coordinator's device run.

## 2026-09-28: the benches graded on missed refreshes, and what is still missed

`bench_worst_ms=20.0` graded Top->Swap. Top->Swap includes the vsync wait, so a settled 19 ms
frame failed the gate, and the gate could not tell such a frame from a real drop. The benches now
count missed display refreshes per present interval: `max(0, round(ms/16.67) - 1)`. For the first
frame after idle, the interval is its Top->Swap. `bench_missed_max` is 0. Every number below is
from the television, with the panel off and the sound muted.

| run | missed refreshes | worst_ms p50 / p95 / max |
|---|---|---|
| push, before (first 17 cycles) | 28 in 17 cycles; cycle 1 alone 7 | — |
| push-100, after | 12 in 8 of 100 cycles; cycle 1: 4 | 19.6 / 25.6 / 41.6 |
| modal-100, after | 16 in 9 of 100 cycles | 19.4 / 28.5 / 43.2 |
| deep-100, after (200 steps) | 18 in 13 of 200 steps | 17.6 / 28.1 / 41.7 |

**What was fixed.** The cold first Detail cycle had three causes.

- **An 82 ms capture frame.** The replacement capture rasterised every string that had landed
  after the dip's floor. The held top page is now walked through the text recorder, and
  quiescence waits for the prewarm queue to drain.
- **Face opens and glyph metrics.** The first walk still paid for four face opens and 176 cold
  measurements: 23 ms in one frame. Idle font warming (`text::warm_fonts_idle`) now opens every
  theme face and loads its ASCII glyph metrics in 2 ms slices while the loop sleeps. The walk fell
  from 28.9 ms to 10.7 ms.
- **The walk stacking on the GPU wait.** The walk is CPU only, so it now runs before the page
  pass, overlapping the driver's wait in the first framebuffer command instead of adding to it.
  The first Detail frame went from 51 ms to 33.5 ms, and then to 25.6 ms.

**What is not fixed.** Almost every remaining miss is ONE frame.

- **push-100 and deep-100.** The frames record `prepare`/`draw` spans of 1–2 ms. They wait 22–39
  ms in `clear`, the first framebuffer command, during a held-image phase whose own GPU work is
  one full-screen quad and the chrome. The frames before them were normal. The backlog they wait
  on is not this frame's work, and no span attributes it. Whether it is the Home capture's GPU
  cost, the compositor holding a buffer, or GPU DVFS is still open; `gpu_timer` saw the UI pass
  average ~16 ms during transitions.
- **modal-100.** Its steady misses are close frames whose `draw` is 25–31 ms with under 2 ms in
  named spans, so the wait sits in an unspanned GL call.
- **Cycle 1.** A 1080p backdrop upload (2 073 600 px) spent 22.5 ms in `upload_rgba` in one held
  Detail frame, and Settings' first open spent 34.5 ms in `surf`.

These cycles fail the gate on purpose. Raising `bench_missed_max` to the measured count would turn
drops into a baseline.

### 2026-09-29: invisible walks stop doing visible-walk work (host-sim evidence only)

- **Settings' `surf` cost was cold text on the capture frame.** A presented surface is held at
  appear 0 on the frame that renders the host snapshot. Its walk drew live, so Settings rasterised
  and uploaded 21 strings there. Handing the surface `Painter::recording()` was not enough:
  Settings (like every panel) builds its own `Painter::root()`. `ui::record_walk` now makes
  EVERY painter record for the length of a prewarm walk. The page dip's walk uses it too. A held
  surface's strings are recorded on the capture frame and drained on the next held frame, under
  the shared per-frame prewarm budget. The hold lasts while text is pending, up to
  `SURFACE_TEXT_HOLD_MAX_MS` (100 ms). On the host sim the capture frame's `draw` fell from 4.8 to
  1.9 ms, `surf` from 3.1 to 0.4 ms, and `textx21` moved out of it.
- **Stops were placed by every walk.** Detail's `record_stops` (and Home's, Library's, the
  player's, Person's, Search's, Collection's and Filmography's) ran in the discovery walk, each
  blur-source replay and the text recorder. Only the visible walk's stops reach the hit map.
  `DrawFrame::records_stops` now gates them. A 24-episode show placed 51 stops in discovery
  alone.
- New FRAMEDROP spans: `text` (a glyph-cache miss), `host`, `src`, `warm` and `warmdrain`. They
  are there so the television can attribute what is left. The GPU-side `clear` waits and the 1080p
  backdrop upload are not addressed here.
