Extract a shared UI system from the **player screen** (the one screen with a coherent
design language: `widgets.rs` / `table.rs` / `label.rs` / `icons.rs` / `mod.rs`) and
migrate the two drifted client screens (`home.rs`, `detail.rs`) onto it — first onto
**tokens + components + cap-band text**, then onto the **retained `View` tree** (`mod.rs`
`update → layout → draw`).

**Correctness signal:** there is no host runtime. The *only* build/regression check is
`make` (webOS-NDK ARM cross-build). Every numbered step below must leave `make` green, and
must not change the C-ABI entry-point *signatures* that `app.rs` / `route.rs` / the
dev-trigger headless harness call (`home_init/update/draw/move_focus/pointer_focus/wheel`;
detail `open/open_rk/open_rk_season/close/update/draw/move_focus/on_ok`) until the final
thin-wrapper phase.

**Design stance (synthesized).** The user chose the *full retui migration* — home **and**
detail onto the retained tree. We commit to that, taking the player substrate's literals as
the canonical token values and its component APIs as the shared APIs (player-as-reference),
staged so the low-risk token/text sweep lands first and the structural tree work lands last
behind its own checkpoints. Three carve-outs stay immediate-mode on purpose (§D) because a
`View` wrapper there breaks a load-bearing contract for zero payoff.

## (A) TOKEN TABLE

> **This table is the ORIGINAL migration inventory (what each token replaced, at that day's line
> numbers) — not the current palette.** `theme.rs` is. Several values below were superseded on the
> device long ago (`SURFACE_APP` `[0.10,0.10,0.115]` → the Apple-TV shelf gray `#2c2c2e`, and with it
> `CLEAR_RGB`), and the **2026-08-13 palette sync** with the `PlxNative Design System` project
> changed five more: `ACCENT` went from the mockup's warm "Snow" `#e9e6e0` to Cool 0 `#f7fafc` and
> the second control white went away with it (`FILL_PRIMARY`/`INK_ON_PRIMARY` and
> `ControlStyle::Primary` are **gone** — nothing is filled by rank, only by focus; the cool plate
> survives as `SURFACE_QR_PLATE`, a scan surface on the sign-in screen); `CONTROL_SPENT_FILL` is now
> that accent mixed toward the shelf rather than a warm grey; `PANEL_TOP` is `SURFACE_PANEL`'s own
> stop at .985; `SKELETON_TOP` is `CARD_PLACEHOLDER`'s stop, so both lean blue. `theme.rs` is also
> two-layered now (private primitives → public roles, mirroring the design project's
> `primitives.css` + `colors.css`), which is where a new shade goes.

New module `rust-modules/src/ui/theme.rs`. Colors are `pub const [f32; 4]` unless noted.
`ACCENT` / `ACCENT_INK` move here from `mod.rs:28-29` and are **re-exported** from `mod.rs`
(`pub use theme::{ACCENT, ACCENT_INK};`) so existing `crate::ui::ACCENT` imports in
`widgets.rs` / `table.rs` keep compiling unchanged.

Two collapses are deliberately **lossy** (many near-identical values → one token). They are
invisible until on-TV capture; each is gated behind its own `make` + capture checkpoint.

| `CLEAR_RGB` | `(0.03, 0.03, 0.045)` **3-float tuple** | GL clear `home.rs:428 frame_clear` — kept as a 3-float form (`frame_clear` takes `r,g,b`, no alpha), distinct from `SURFACE_APP` which overdraws it |
| `SURFACE_PANEL` | `[0.133, 0.133, 0.141, 1.0]` | opaque menu panel / fade mask / badge knockout `table.rs:81`; meta_badge interior `info_panel.rs:135` |

| Token / helper | Value | Replaces |
|---|---|---|

### Rails / overlays / accents
| Token | Value | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| `RAIL_TRACK` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.20]` | ProgressBar track `widgets.rs:367`; scrubber track `player_hud.rs:214` (merge 0.24 near-dup) |

| `RESUME_FILL` | `[0.98, 0.72, 0.18, 0.95]` | warm amber Continue-Watching fill `home.rs:68` (unique Plex-progress accent; no player equivalent — hosted so `Card`/`ProgressBar.fill` can import it) |
| `HAIRLINE` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.10]` | section divider `table.rs:243` |
| `OVERLAY_FOCUS_PILL` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.14]` | detail hand-rolled tab focus pill `detail.rs:481` (becomes `ACCENT` when `TabPill` is adopted — kept as a token until then) |
| `OVERLAY_FOCUS_SOFT` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.07]` | About selection panel `detail.rs:876` |
| `OVERLAY_BORDER` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.55]` | meta_badge border `info_panel.rs:132` |
| `TINT_WHITE` | `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]` | no-op texture tint (structural, not drift): `home.rs:97`, `detail.rs:282/:581/:628`, `info_panel.rs:233` |

### Non-tokenizable (documented so a sweep leaves them alone)
| Name | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `FOCUS_GLOW` (doc only) | ring `vec3(1.0)`, glow `vec3(0.85,0.9,1.0)` @0.40 | **Shader-baked** in `gfx.rs:12` (FS_SRC). `draw_rect`/`Painter::ring` expose only a `focus:f32` scalar. An ACCENT-tinted or reshaped ring requires a shader uniform edit — out of scope. Recorded so no one re-adds it as a literal. |
| `CARD_RING_PAD_GRID` = `48.0`, `CARD_RING_PAD_STRIP` = `6.0`, `CARD_RING_RAD` = `14.0`, `FOCUS_ON` = `1.0`, `FOCUS_OFF` = `0.0` | — | Ring **geometry** constants (not colors). Home grid ring uses pad 48 + focus `(s-1)/0.055` (`home.rs:307`); `draw_card`/tiles use pad 6 + focus 1.0 (`widgets.rs:55`). These are visibly different glows — expose the pad as a parameter so home migrates byte-identically; do **not** unify blindly. |

---

## (B) COMPONENT CATALOG

All components draw through `Painter` over the C `gfx`/`text` primitives (no GL). Label-family
structs hold a non-owning `*const c_char` (Copy), so every call site must keep its `CString`
alive for the draw frame — the existing discipline (`table.rs` already does this inline).

### `theme` module — **new** (`rust-modules/src/ui/theme.rs`)
```rust
// tokens from §A as `pub const [f32; 4]` (+ CLEAR_RGB: (f32,f32,f32))
pub const fn scrim(a: f32)       -> [f32; 4] { [0.02, 0.02, 0.03, a] }
pub const fn scrim_black(a: f32) -> [f32; 4] { [0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  a] }
// splat a token's rgb with an overridden alpha (for env.sp-baked hub title, etc.)
pub const fn with_a(c: [f32; 4], a: f32) -> [f32; 4] { [c[0], c[1], c[2], a] }
```

### `Label` — **exists** (`label.rs:40`), keep verbatim
```rust
Label::new(text: *const c_char, sz: c_int, col: [f32;4]) -> Label
    .bold() .h(HAlign::{Left,Center,Right}) .v(VAlign::{Middle,CapTop,Baseline})
    .draw(&self, p: Painter, frame: Rect) -> f32   // painted width
```
The **layout ≠ paint** cap-band primitive (`text::text_cap_band`, `text.rs:315`). Every
single-run `p.text()` with a hand-tuned y in home/detail migrates onto this. Because it
centers the **cap band** (not the top-anchored y), each migrated run needs a derived frame:
`VAlign::CapTop` puts cap-top on `frame.y`, closely matching `draw_text`'s top-left `y`
(verify the small `cap_top` offset on-device).

### `TextView` — **SHIPPED** (`text_view.rs`; was planned here as `TextBlock` in `widgets.rs`)
```rust
TextView::new(text: &str, sz: c_int, col: [f32;4]) -> TextView
    .bold() .leading(px: f32) .h(HAlign) .max_lines(n: usize)
    .measure_h(&self, width: f32) -> f32
    .draw(&self, p: Painter, frame: Rect) -> f32   // consumed height; frame.w = wrap width
```
The one thing `Label` cannot express: multi-line flow. It went further than the planned
`TextBlock`: instead of taking pre-wrapped `*const c_char` lines, it takes a raw `&str` and does
its **own pixel word-wrap** (measured, not char-count), cap-band `Label` per line, ellipsis at
`max_lines`, and reports height. So it **replaced** the char-count `wrap_two`/`wrap_ep` helpers
(deleted) at the hero synopses (`home.rs`, `detail.rs`), episode summaries, and About columns
(`draw_pair`/Languages/Accessibility). Wrapping is memoized (`WRAP_CACHE`, `Rc`-shared) so the
per-frame cost is a hash + refcount bump. Not a reflow engine; the About summary's inline `MORE`
tail still uses `wrap_lines` pending a trailing-run hook.

### `Button` — **generalize** (`widgets.rs:310`)
```rust
enum ControlStyle { Accent, Primary, Custom { fill: [f32;4], ink: [f32;4] } }
Button::new(label: *const c_char, sz: c_int, frame: Rect) -> Button
    .icon(Icon) .leading_tri(bool) .focused(bool) .style(ControlStyle)
impl View for Button   // update noop; draw()
```
Already centers `[icon + gap + label]` via `text_vcenter_y` and encodes ACCENT-vs-idle by
`.focused()`. Add `.style()` (default `Accent` = `ACCENT`/`INK_ON_ACCENT` focused,
`CONTROL_IDLE_FILL`/`CONTROL_IDLE_INK` idle; `Primary` = `FILL_PRIMARY`/`INK_ON_PRIMARY`) and
`.leading_tri()` to absorb `PillButton::play`'s triangle. Replaces detail's `draw_buttons`
(`detail.rs:406`) wholesale — its four fn-local consts (WHITE/DARK_INK/DARK_FILL/LIGHT_INK)
become `Primary`/`Accent` + tokens. `PillButton` (`widgets.rs:99`) and `CircleButton`
(`:133`, keep for circular +/i glyphs) fold their raw-y text onto `Label` internally so the
last hand-guessed baselines in the substrate die.

### `TabPill` — **exists** (`widgets.rs:271`), already token-aware
```rust
TabPill::width(chars: usize, sz: c_int) -> f32
TabPill::new(label: *const c_char, sz: c_int, frame: Rect) -> TabPill .focused(bool)
impl View for TabPill   // ACCENT focus / CONTROL_IDLE_FILL idle; label via Label::Center.bold()
```
Replaces detail's hand-rolled `draw_tabs` (`detail.rs:458`: manual measure pass +
`[1,1,1,0.14]` highlight pill). **Adoption is a visible change** — detail's active tab goes
from near-white-text-on-faint-pill to a filled ACCENT pill (intended unification; call it out
in the PR).

### `Row` / `TableView` — **exists** (`table.rs`), keep bespoke ABI
```rust
TableView::new(); set_sections(Vec<Section>, sel: i32, slide: bool);
    move_sel(i32); update(dt: f32, visible_h: f32); draw(p: Painter, frame: Rect);
    measured_height() -> f32;  field .sel
Section::new(header).accessory(a).row(Row)
Row::new(label).checked(b).detail(s).badge(Badge).chevron(b).dim(b)   // ROW_H=60 / _TALL=92
Badge::{ Ad, Forced, Sdh, Cc, Text(String) }
```
The cleanest realized pattern — owns `hl_top`/`hl_bot`/`scroll` springs and a sliding ACCENT
pill; `track_menu` delegates 100%. **Do not** force it onto the `View` trait for the PlxNative
(reconciling its `update(dt,visible_h)`/`draw(p,frame)` ABI with `View::update(&Env)`/
`draw(&Env,p)` is churn with zero payoff). Only sweep its literals onto tokens
(`:220`→`TEXT_PRIMARY`, `:221`→`TEXT_TERTIARY`, `:81`→`SURFACE_PANEL`, `:243`→`HAIRLINE`;
`:232/:259/:260` already ACCENT). Reuse `Row` for detail's About key/values (`draw_pair`,
`detail.rs:833`).

### `Icon` — **exists** (`icons.rs:13/:96`), theme-safe, no change
```rust
enum Icon { Cc, Audio, Check, Chevron, Play, Pause, Info /* + Plus, Info-glyph as needed */ }
icons::draw(p: Painter, id: Icon, r: Rect, tint: [f32;4])
```
Color is entirely the `tint` (mask rendered white), so passing any token just works. Add
`Icon::Plus` so detail's `+`/`i` glyph `CircleButton`s (`detail.rs:422/:426`) can become real
AA icons matching the transport buttons (optional polish). Caveat: `static mut CACHE`,
main-GL-thread only.

### `Card` + focus-ring — **new**, unifies the two inline cards + `draw_card` + `draw_poster`
Retained View owning the scale-pop spring (the `ProgressBar` pattern, `widgets.rs:355`):
```rust
enum Art<'a> { Poster(Option<&'a PmsMovie>), Thumb { key: &'a str, res: (c_int,c_int) }, None }
struct RingStyle { pad: f32, rad: f32 }
impl RingStyle { const GRID: RingStyle = RingStyle { pad: 48.0, rad: 14.0 };
                 const TILE: RingStyle = RingStyle { pad: 6.0,  rad: 14.0 }; }

struct Card { frame: Rect, scale: Spring, focused: bool, radius: f32,
              art: Art, ring: RingStyle, resume: f32 /* 0 = none */, resume_fill: [f32;4] }
Card::poster(m: Option<&PmsMovie>) -> Card
Card::thumb(key: &str, res: (c_int,c_int)) -> Card
    .focused(bool) .radius(f32) .ring(RingStyle) .resume(frac: f32)
impl View for Card {
    fn update(&mut self, e: &Env) { self.scale.step(if self.focused { TARGET } else { 1.0 }, K_SCALE, e.dt); }
    fn draw(&self, _e: &Env, p: Painter) {
        let r = if self.focused { self.frame.scaled(self.scale.pos) } else { self.frame };
        // draw_poster / tex-or-CARD_PLACEHOLDER; resume rail (RAIL_BUFFERED / resume_fill);
        // if focused: p.ring(r, self.ring.pad, self.ring.rad * self.scale.pos, focus_scalar)
    }
}
```
Replaces home `Card` (`home.rs:194`, currently owns only the spring — visuals decomposed
inline in `Shelf::draw_cells`/`Grid::draw`), the free `draw_card` (`widgets.rs:39`), and
detail's inline Related tiles (`detail.rs:574-594`). Grid keeps `RingStyle::GRID` (pad 48,
focus `(s-1)/0.055`); episode/chapters/related keep `RingStyle::TILE`.
**Z-order caveat:** the parent still owns depth — `Grid` draws non-focused Cards, then the
focused Card **last** (`home.rs:296-311`); `Card::draw` alone cannot reproduce the
focused-last overlay. Cast headshots stay inline (circular, `detail.rs:614-648`) — not worth a
Card variant for one call site. `draw_card`/`draw_poster` stay as thin free-fn shims over
`Card` during migration so `chapters_panel`/`info_panel` callers are untouched.

### `Chip` — **new**, unifies the badge impls (low priority, do last)
```rust
enum ChipStyle { Outlined, Filled }
chip(p: Painter, x: f32, cy: f32, text: *const c_char, style: ChipStyle) -> f32   // width
```
Collapses `meta_badge` (`info_panel.rs:127`, border `OVERLAY_BORDER`, h34/sz22, cap-band),
`draw_badge` (`table.rs:389`, border=col, h26/sz19, `cy-sz*0.58` guess), and detail's
accessibility badges (`detail.rs:843`). Interior `SURFACE_PANEL`, text via `Label(Middle)` so
the 0.58 guess dies. Pick one metric (≈h30/sz20) and accept a few-px shift on the Info card +
track menu.

---

## (C) IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Ordering principle: **additive first → values → text → components → tree → routing**;
one file per step where possible; `make` green after **every** step; home before detail;
the C-ABI signatures unchanged until the final wrapper phases. Steps 5-6 (the tree work) and
step 7 (routing) are the ones the user explicitly asked for; steps 1-4 de-risk them.

**Step 1 — add `ui/theme.rs` (additive, no call sites).**
Create `rust-modules/src/ui/theme.rs` with all §A tokens + `scrim`/`scrim_black`/`with_a`
helpers + the ring-geometry/`FOCUS_*` constants. Move `ACCENT`/`ACCENT_INK` into it; add
`pub mod theme;` and `pub use theme::{ACCENT, ACCENT_INK};` to `mod.rs`. Nothing consumes the
new tokens yet. *Checkpoint:* `make` (pure addition; `#![allow(dead_code)]` already present).

**Step 2 — migrate color literals to tokens, screen by screen (no structure change).**
Pure literal→const substitution; byte-identical except the deliberate merges.
- **2a substrate** (`widgets.rs` + `table.rs`): the 3 `CONTROL_IDLE_FILL` dups
  (`:256/:298/:338`), PillButton fill/ink (`:109`), ProgressBar rails (`:367/:385`),
  `draw_poster` SK_T/SK_B (`:18/:19`), `draw_card` placeholder (`:52`), `table.rs` PANEL_BG
  (`:81`)/row text (`:220/:221`)/hairline (`:243`). *Checkpoint:* `make` — player screen now
  fully tokenized, zero behavior change.
- **2b player surfaces** (`player_hud.rs` / `track_menu.rs` / `info_panel.rs` /
  `chapters_panel.rs`): scrims → `scrim_black`, panel gradients → `PANEL_TOP/BOT`, text →
  `TEXT_*`, meta_badge interior → `SURFACE_PANEL`. *Checkpoint:* `make`.
- **2c home** (`home.rs`): `:86`→`SURFACE_APP`, `:67`→`RAIL_BUFFERED`, `:68`→`RESUME_FILL`,
  `:104/:105`→`scrim(sa)`, `:140/:291/:310`→`TEXT_PRIMARY` (hub title keeps `env.sp` alpha via
  `with_a(TEXT_PRIMARY, env.sp)`), `:141`→`TEXT_SECONDARY`, `:428`→`CLEAR_RGB`. Keep
  Backdrop's per-element alphas (`:80-108`) **explicit** — do not fold into `p.alpha()`
  (ambient writes opaque pixels; art/scrim fade on independent curves. The cascade still reaches
  the whole `Backdrop` from above — see the amended carve-out 1 below.)
  *Checkpoint:* `make` + on-TV capture (3 near-whites collapse to one — intended).
- **2d detail** (`detail.rs`): reconcile the two fn-local palettes (`draw_buttons` `:409-412`,
  `draw_about` `:857-860`) + scattered runs onto `TEXT_PRIMARY/HEADING/SECONDARY/TERTIARY` +
  `INK_ON_ACCENT`; backdrop/scrim `:282/:293/:300`→`TINT_WHITE`/`scrim`; placeholders
  `:587/:634`→`CARD_PLACEHOLDER`/`SKELETON_*`; overlays `:481/:520/:521/:876`→`OVERLAY_*`/
  `RAIL_*`. Leave `draw_buttons`' focus **inversion** as literals for now (pure color-merge, no
  design decision yet). *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture.

**Step 3 — sweep `Label` / cap-band across all raw `p.text()` sites (text positioning).**
The high-risk-per-pixel, low-structural-value step — sequence it isolated so a regression
bisects to one screen. `Label` centers the cap band, so each run needs a derived frame that
reproduces its current top-anchored draw-y (`VAlign::CapTop` at `frame.y = current_y`).
- **3a** add `TextBlock` to `widgets.rs` (additive; `make`).
- **3b home**: hero title/meta (`home.rs:163/:169`) → `Label`; synopsis (`:174-183`) →
  `TextBlock` (leading 30 to match the +128/+158 step); hub title (`:291`) and focused-card
  title (`:310`) → `Label`. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture (first step that can shift pixels
  vertically — eyeball hero + card titles vs a pre-change capture).
- **3c detail**: the 22 single runs → `Label`; the ~10 multi-line runs (synopsis, episode
  summary `:532-542`, About values) → `TextBlock`; kill the invisible-measure-then-place
  patterns (right-aligned "Starring" `:399`, tab measure `:479`) via `Label::Right` /
  `TabPill::width`. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture.

*Fallback gate:* if a `Label`/`TextBlock` run shows unacceptable drift on-device that the
frame derivation can't dial out, revert **just that run** to the tokenized raw `p.text()`
(color token from step 2 survives). Keeps every checkpoint shippable.

**Step 4 — promote shared components + adopt in home/detail.**
One component swap per sub-step, `make` between each.
- **4a** generalize `Button` (`ControlStyle` + `leading_tri`); fold `PillButton`/`CircleButton`
  text onto `Label` internally. `make`.
- **4b** land `Card`/`RingStyle` in `widgets.rs`; re-express `draw_card`/`draw_poster` as
  shims over it. `make` (player/chapters/info unaffected).
- **4c home** cards: replace `Shelf::draw_cells` non-focused draw (`home.rs:230-246`) and the
  `Grid::draw` focused block (`:297-311`) with `Card` (`RingStyle::GRID`, resume frac). Keep
  the focused-last overlay pass and the skip at `:232`. `resume_bar` + inline ring + card title
  disappear into `Card`. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture (ring pad/scale-pop unchanged).
- **4d detail** components: `draw_buttons`→`Button{Primary/Accent}`+`CircleButton` — this
  **commits the focus-inversion decision** (cool-white → warm ACCENT); `draw_tabs`→`TabPill`
  (active tab → ACCENT pill); Related tiles→`Card{RingStyle::TILE}`; episode still already uses
  `draw_card`→now `Card`; About key/values→`Row`/`TableView`; badges→`Chip`. `make` + capture
  after 4d (design-visible).

*After step 4 the visible-consistency goal is met on every screen.* Steps 5-7 are the
structural retui migration the user asked for.

**Step 5 — home.rs onto the View tree (mostly already done).**
`Home` already owns `bg/hero/grid` as typed `View` fields with a `static mut SCENE:
Option<Home>` (`home.rs:398`). Finish the contract:
- Move the per-cell scale stepping out of `Shelf::update` into `Card::update` (each `Card` now
  owns its spring, `ProgressBar`-style). `Shelf` keeps `scroll_x`; `Grid` keeps `scroll_y` +
  `nav`/`vert`/`hit_test`/`wheel`.
- Rename `Shelf::draw_cells` → conform to a `draw(&Env, Painter)` shape where practical, but
  **keep** the two-pass overlay in `Grid::draw` (non-focused then focused-last) — a naive
  depth-first draw would paint the ring under neighboring cards.
- Backdrop stays a draw-only `View` managing its own per-element alphas (do not route through
  `p.alpha()`). Focus stays the three `static mut` (`fr/fc/snapTarget`) read live via `Env`
  each frame; the `app.rs` accessor bridge (`row/col/snap_target/set_*`, `app.rs:116-124`) is
  unchanged. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture. No new C-ABI.

**Step 6 — detail.rs onto the View tree (the real lift — no view instance exists today).**
- **6a** introduce `struct DetailView { section: c_int, col: c_int, scroll: Spring,
  card_scale: Spring, ep_hscroll: Spring }` absorbing the module statics
  (`detail.rs:19-24`), with `static mut DETAIL: Option<DetailView>` mirroring home's `SCENE`.
  Realize `View::update/layout/draw` by moving the bodies of the existing free
  `update/draw/move_focus` onto methods. Make the existing pub fns `open/open_rk/
  open_rk_season/close/update/draw/move_focus/on_ok/last_resume_ns/selected_ptr` **thin
  wrappers** forwarding to methods — so `app.rs` routing, `route.rs`, and the dev-triggers
  (`nativejelly-detail*`, `app.rs:886-1053`) compile **unchanged**. *Checkpoint:* `make`.
- **6b** section rows (episodes/related/cast) become child sub-views composed by
  `DetailView::draw` under the translated `ps = p.translate(0,-scroll)` painter. Unify the two
  horizontal-scroll models: adopt the sprung `ep_hscroll` glide for Related/Cast too (kill the
  instant-snap asymmetry `detail.rs:566/:612`) via a shared `HScrollRow` helper
  (`scroll: Spring`, pins focus to 2nd slot; callers still cull off-frame cells by index —
  `Painter` has no clip). **Keep** the absolute `section_top()` Y table
  (`TAB_Y..ABOUT_Y`, `detail.rs:37-52/:108-125`) — do **not** build a flow/`VStack`; About's
  dynamic height doesn't justify a layout engine in a PlxNative, and a naive reflow risks section
  collisions. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture.

**Step 7 — align app.rs routing/input (the convergence — touches shared state, do last).**
- **7a** replace the flat route bools (`playing`/`detail_open`/`menu_open`/`info_open`/
  `chapters_open`, `app.rs:329-334`) with one `enum Route { Home, Detail, Player }` + the modal
  flags, so update-dispatch becomes exclusive (today `home_update` runs every frame regardless,
  `app.rs:1151`). Draw-dispatch is already exclusive. *Checkpoint:* `make`.
- **7b** optional purist convergence: a single `ui::focus::FocusPath { screen, section, col,
  snap }` replacing home's `fr/fc/snapTarget` and detail's `SECTION/COL`; `Env` carries it;
  each screen's nav writes it; the `g_fr/g_fc/g_snap/set_*` shims (`app.rs:116-124`) re-point at
  it so the snap split-ownership (target set in `app.rs:588-594`, spring chased in home) and the
  headless dev-triggers keep resolving. **This is the only step that mutates app.rs-shared focus
  state** — if it destabilizes the snap edge-trigger or the harness, **stop at 7a**: home+detail
  are already full `View` structs on tokens+components by then (~90% of the win at a fraction of
  the risk). Preserve the raw LG-SDL byte-offset decode (`+16/+20/+24`) and webOS wcodes exactly
  — CLAUDE.md flags them as fragile. *Checkpoint:* `make` + capture + run the dev-trigger
  headless flows.

## (D) WHERE FULL VIEW MIGRATION IS **NOT** WORTH IT (stays immediate-mode)

Honest carve-outs — a `View` wrapper here breaks a load-bearing contract for no payoff (these are
about a specific contract, NOT about "it's only a throwaway" — that is never the reason):

1. **home `Backdrop`**: four elements fade on independent curves and `Painter::ambient` intentionally
   ignores the cascade alpha. Folding into an alpha'd subtree visibly breaks the hero fade — that
   contract is intact and is *why* the component is shaped the way it is.
   **AMENDED** — it is no longer *draw-only*. The per-element alphas are now **springs** (the two art
   reveals that cross-fade a backdrop in when it decodes, plus a whole `AmbientWash` for the page
   ground), and springs need a `View::update`, which `home_update` calls explicitly beside
   `grid.update`. The carve-out that stands is the one about the cascade: those alphas are still
   passed per element and must never be routed through `p.alpha()`, so the art and the wash keep
   fading on their own curves. `update` is also where each layer's texture is resolved once, so the
   draw cannot disagree with the springs about whether there is anything to reveal.
   **AMENDED AGAIN (`ui::nav`)** — "a wash cannot be alpha-faded at all" was true only of fading one
   ITEM's colours into ANOTHER'S, which is still twelve springs. Fading a wash toward the app's own
   GROUND is now the cascade's job: `Painter::ambient` mixes its corners toward `theme::SURFACE_APP`
   at an alpha below 1, which is what lets a whole page — `Backdrop` included — dip for the
   route-level page transition. The pixels it writes are still opaque; only the corner rgb moves.
2. ~~**detail absolute section layout**: keep the hard-coded Y table; no reflow engine.~~
   **SUPERSEDED** — detail is now a single computed vertical flow: `DetailScreen::section_top`
   stacks the present blocks' `block_h()` heights from `CONTENT_TOP`, each separated by whichever of
   `section_gap`'s three answers applies — `SECTION_GAP` between ordinary sections, `TAB_EP_GAP`
   where tabs hug their episodes, and `consts::UNDER_LABEL_AIR` after a shelf section that is
   already reserving its own label band — and both the draws and `scroll_target` read it. Block heights are content-derived
   (Related tracks `REL_H`=`CARD_H`), so resizing a block reflows everything below with no magic
   constants. The original carve-out was wrong — the manual `CAST_Y`/`ABOUT_Y` bump needed when
   Related grew was exactly the drift a flow removes.
3. **player surfaces** (`player_hud.rs` / `track_menu.rs` / `info_panel.rs` /
   `chapters_panel.rs`): out of scope for THIS migration (the retui View tree) — still true, and
   unrelated to what changed underneath it. **AMENDED (restructure phase 12, D2)** — the sentence
   above described a SHARED pointer-hit-test contract with `app.rs`'s free functions
   (`icon_hit`/`sb_w`) as a reason a tree rewrite would break the remote's pointer; that contract
   no longer exists in that shape. `PlayerScreen` (`screens/player/mod.rs`) and its overlay
   (`screens/player/overlay.rs`) now answer `FocusSource::Engine`/`HitSource::Engine`: HUD hit
   geometry is collected as `(elem, Rect)` stops at draw time and registered through
   `DrawFrame::stop`, and the transport key ladder (PAUSE/PLAY/STOP/BACK/UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/OK)
   lives in `PlayerScreen::step`, not in a `Route::Player` arm of `app/run.rs`.

   **AMENDED AGAIN (phase 12, PX-PLAYER): the loop's player input path is DELETED, not standing
   beside the new one.** The paragraph above used to record that `app/run.rs` "still calls the raw
   `player_hud::failure_quality_hit`/`icon_hit`/`scrub_hit` functions directly" and that "its own
   hand-rolled `Route::Player` key arms still exist beside `PlayerScreen::step`", and that
   understated the situation in the way that mattered: those were not two implementations of which
   one happened to be dormant, they were two implementations LIVE ON ONE PIECE OF STATE —
   `PlayerScreen::scrub` — because `on_key_up`, `on_auto_repeat` and the loop's per-frame block
   went on writing it after the page began answering `HitSource::Engine`. What that produced was
   three shipped regressions: one RIGHT tap issued two seeks, a scrub taken while paused started
   the film, and a click on the scrub bar toggled play/pause while drag-scrubbing disappeared
   entirely. All of it is gone — the key arms (failure read-out, UP/DOWN, STOP, LEFT/RIGHT), both
   pointer blocks, the `SCRUB_LOST_MS` safety commit, the tap debounce, the continuous advance and
   `app::input::Pointer::drag` — and `key_player_failed`, `key_player_updown`, `key_scrub`,
   `seed_scrub` and `player_hud::scrub_hit` are deleted with them. `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `hittest`
   gate is GREEN as of that package.

   **AMENDED A THIRD TIME (phase 12, PX-OVERLAYS): the other gap named above is closed too.** The
   four overlay components — `track_menu.rs`, `chapters_panel.rs`, `info_panel.rs`,
   `more_menu.rs` — no longer carry the OLD `move_focus`/`pointer_focus`/`focus_is_ctl` methods
   that `screens/player/overlay.rs` used to call directly beside the `*Part` wrappers:
   `screens/player/overlay.rs`'s `Focusable` impl now delegates to whichever panel's `*Part`
   wrapper is active, `step` no longer moves a cursor by hand (a direction falls through to the
   engine's `neighbour`/`EdgeRule` unless the panel's own repeat gate is pacing it or the engine
   just re-delivered the key at the panel's group edge — a tab switch for Tracks, dropping focus
   to the HUD tabs for Chapters/Info), OK is left to the engine's `Activate`/press machinery, and
   `draw` registers each row's own stop instead of one whole-screen `Stop`. `ci/check-deps.sh`'s
   `ladder` gate is 0 across `ui/` + `screens/`. **AMENDED A FOURTH TIME (phase 12, PX-D1): the
   rest of the backlog is closed.** `route`/`fnlen`/`testmod` were the three gates left red, all
   three for one reason — `enum Route` still existed — and D1 deleted it along with `app/nav.rs`
   and `ui/trail.rs`. `check-deps.sh` is green across every gate: no `Route::` in `app/`, no
   `enum Route` in the tree, `app/run.rs::run` at 104 lines against a 200 budget, `nj_run` at 10,
   and 0 `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks in `app/mod.rs`. `draw_clock` and subtitles are still bespoke
   and not `Label`-expressible, and remain immediate-mode by the same original reasoning.

---

## Tradeoffs (called out honestly)

- **Two token collapses are real, un-previewable visual changes.** 3-4 near-white primaries →
  one `TEXT_PRIMARY`; ~7 dim greys → `SECONDARY`/`TERTIARY`. Only on-TV capture shows the
  luminance nudge — hence the per-step capture gates. The alternative (a token per observed
  value) defeats the purpose.
- **Adopting ACCENT on detail is a design change, not a refactor.** Detail's hero-button focus
  and season tabs currently use an *inverted* cool-white treatment; steps 4d make them warm
  ACCENT to match the player. `ControlStyle::Custom` is the escape hatch if that reads wrong
  on-device.
- **The focus ring is shader-locked** (`gfx.rs:12`): cool-blue glow + white stroke, driven only
  by a `focus:f32` scalar. A token cannot retint it; home's pad-48 glow genuinely differs from
  `draw_card`'s pad-6. "Unify the ring" is a deliberate, param-guarded, deferred change — not a
  mechanical sweep.
- **The focused-last z-order can't live inside `Card::draw`** — the parent (`Grid`) must keep
  the two-pass overlay, so "Card is a View" is only half true; the parent still hand-orders.
- **`Painter` has no clip/scissor** (`mod.rs`): scrolling rows (`Card`/`HScrollRow`) still cull
  by index and hand-roll edge masks. Fine for the fixed 1080p target; a ceiling if overflowing rows
  ever need real edge-fades.
- **`CString` keep-alive:** every `Label`/`Button`/`TextBlock` holds a non-owning
  `*const c_char`; migrated home/detail call sites (which build Rust `String`s) must keep the
  `CString` in scope for the draw frame — no new hazard, but a per-site cost, already the
  `table.rs` pattern.

## (E) WHAT A NEW SCREEN COSTS — restructure phase 10, done-criterion 5

> **Added 2026-09-10, and it is the one section of this file written in the present tense.** The
> rest is the 2026-07 migration's own record; this is the current answer to "I am adding a screen,
> what do I have to touch", proven rather than asserted.

The restructure spec's §0 criterion 5 reads: *a new screen touches its own `screens/<name>.rs`,
`screens/registry.rs`, `dev/scenarios.rs` and `tests/manifest.json` and nothing else.* Two
conversions were run to prove it — the Detail page's **About** sheet and the Person page's
**biography** sheet — and this is what `git diff --name-only` said, verbatim.

### The four the criterion names

| file | what it gains |
|---|---|
| `screens/<name>.rs` | the screen: its `Screen`/`Machine`/`Focusable`/`LogicalState` impls, its `SHAPE`, its own tests (§15.1 `a_new_screen_is_unit_tested_with_no_sdl` — a host of its own, three lines of it, never a sibling's) |
| `screens/registry.rs` | the `AppArg` variant, its `ScreenId`, its canon tag, `ARG_SHAPE`, the one `mount` arm, `every_surface_arg`, `SCREEN_SHAPES` + the pin, and — for a page-owned panel — the `ContentPanel` variant and its `surface()` arm |
| `dev/scenarios.rs` | the headless trigger that reaches it (`/tmp/nativejelly-<name>`), which is what makes a capture and an fps scene possible at all |
| `tests/manifest.json` | the fps scene, keyed on the `overlay=` word the screen's own `Screen::name` prints |

### The four the criterion does not, and why each is honest

* **`screens/mod.rs`** — one `pub(crate) mod` line. A module that is not declared does not exist.
* **`ui/mod.rs`** and the moved file itself — the RETIREMENT pair, present only for a conversion.
  A screen written from scratch touches neither.
* **`ci/allow/statics-migration.txt`** — a conversion RETIRES an entry (9 → 3 over phase 10). It
  only ever shrinks, and a new screen adds nothing to it.
* **the HOST page** — `screens/detail/mod.rs`, `screens/person.rs`. This is the one the criterion's
  wording does not name and the one that cannot be removed: a panel is opened from somewhere, and
  the page that opens it is the page that stops calling the module it used to draw. Both
  conversions kept it minimal — the host loses its call sites and its share of the panel's state
  and gains a `ContentReq::Panel(…)`. (About's diff has a second file of the same screen,
  `detail/tests.rs`, for one word of an import line: production code stopped naming `InputEvent`
  when `panel_input` was deleted.)

### What made the list that short — three mechanisms, landed first

The criterion is a claim about STRUCTURE, and it was false before phase 10 for reasons that had
nothing to do with any screen. Each was fixed in its own commit, before the conversion that
needed it:

1. **`AppArg`, `ARG_SHAPE`, `ScreenId`, `same_instance`, `every_surface_arg` and the one `mount`
   match moved from `app/bridge.rs` into `screens/registry.rs`** (`111282ec`), where §2.1 always
   put them. The blocker was written in `registry.rs`'s own module doc: the argument carries the
   legacy `Route`, `Route` was `app`-private, and a screen may not name `app::`. So `Route` moved
   too (`app/nav.rs` re-exported it), and the mounter became
   generic over the host — the screens were generic already, and the views its arms read arrive
   through the `*Like` accessors. **Phase 12 (D1) finished the job by deleting the enum rather
   than relocating it again**: its seven mountable values are flat `AppArg` variants
   (`Login, Profiles, Onboard, Home, Library, Search, Player`) and the two that could never mount
   (`Detail`, `Person`) are gone, because a page with an ITEM IDENTITY has always mounted from
   `AppArg::Content`. `ARG_SHAPE` gained the seven words and `SCREEN_SHAPES_PIN` moved with it.
2. **`state_fp`'s shape inventory SPLIT** (same commit). Every screen's `SHAPE` is
   `registry::SCREEN_SHAPES`, pinned in that module; `app/recorder.rs` keeps `APP_SHAPES` — the
   press machine, the input state, the frame line, the container tree, the PMS fixtures — pinned
   separately and unmoved by any screen. Without this, every conversion edited `app/recorder.rs`
   twice: once for the entry and once for the pin.
3. **The panel→surface map moved to the registry** (`39d51ae8`, `ContentPanel::surface`), and the
   loop's glass-owner block stopped naming a screen (`3032dbc9`, `Screen::prepare_present` +
   `Dispatcher::prepare_present`). Both were `app/` files a page-owned panel would otherwise have
   had to edit for a fact that is not the loop's.

A fourth thing is a GATE rather than a mechanism: `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `layer` rule, added with the
first of those commits, makes "`screens/` never names `crate::app::`" a grep instead of prose.
The criterion is only worth as much as the boundary underneath it.

### The recipe, for the next one

1. Write `screens/<name>.rs`: the screen, its `SHAPE`, its tests over a local test host.
2. In `screens/registry.rs`: add the `AppArg` variant with a FORWARD-allocated `ScreenId` and canon
   tag (never a vacated one — a retired identity handed to a new screen is a container reusing the
   wrong instance), extend `ARG_SHAPE`, add the `mount` arm, add it to `every_surface_arg` and to
   `SCREEN_SHAPES`, and bump `SCREEN_SHAPES_PIN` with a sentence saying what moved.
3. Declare the module in `screens/mod.rs`.
4. Add the headless trigger in `dev/scenarios.rs`, presenting through the same door the
   interactive press uses, and gate it on the host page's own predicate so the trigger cannot open
   what a press would refuse.
5. Add the fps scene to `tests/manifest.json`.
6. Re-record the replay fixtures (`tools/nativejelly-rec rerecord`), because the pin moved.

---

## (F) TEST-MODULE HOMES (spec §11) — restructure phase 12, D8

Every `#[cfg(test)] mod` that used to sit in `app/mod.rs` moves to the file that owns the thing it
grades, so a reader finds a subject's tests beside the subject rather than in the loop's own
catch-all. Table below is the ACTUAL state, and **it is now complete** — `app/mod.rs` carries zero
`#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks and `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `testmod` gate is green.

**The four that would not move for two phases all gave the same reason, and it was one reason:**
they graded something spelled in terms of the `Route` enum and `app/nav.rs`, so moving one into
`screens/…` would put `crate::app::Route` in a file `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `layer` gate forbids from
naming `crate::app::` at all — the wall `player_return_tests` hit first (phase 9/P5-E1) and that
P7-G re-confirmed. **PX-D1 removed the reason rather than working around it.** With `Route` folded into
`AppArg` (a `screens/` type) and the trail replaced by the container's own stack, each of the four
had a subject that could be named from its subject's own file, and each landed there — which is
also the honest reading of the two-phase delay: the blocker was never the tests' homes, it was the
enum, and every attempt to place them while it existed was going to fail the same gate.

| Test module | Old home | New home | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `route_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | SPLIT — `app/boot.rs` + `screens/registry.rs` | **done** (PX-D1). It was never one subject: the direct-screen server rule is not a route rule at all and is now `boot::direct_server_tests`, beside `resolve_direct_server`; the profile chip's alphabet is `ScreenArg::chrome`'s, so it is asked of `chrome()` one line below the impl — inside the `layer` gate rather than reaching for `app::input` |
| `key_layout_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | `app/events.rs` | **done** (PX-D1) — beside `decode_key`/`encode_key` and the raw `SDL_KeyboardEvent` offsets it pins |
| `heartbeat_word_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | `app/words.rs` (new) | **done** (PX-D1) — moved WITH the alphabet it grades (`route_word`, `every_route`, `overlay_word`, `overlay_suffix`, `NO_OVERLAY`), because the point of those tests is that the two word tables are DERIVED rather than transcribed, and a derivation split across two files is a transcription again |
| `root_back_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | `app/lifecycle.rs` | **done** (P7-G) |
| `delete_local_data_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | `app/playback.rs` | **done** (P7-G) |
| `player_return_tests` | `app/mod.rs` | `app/playback.rs` | **done** (PX-D1), and NOT at the `screens/player/input.rs` this table proposed twice: what it grades is the player's RETURN, which is `enter_player`/`exit_player`'s origin — a container operation the loop performs, so it belongs beside them and the `layer` gate is not in the way |
| `repeat_gate_tests` | (phase 10, already at) `screens/registry.rs` | stays — beside the `RepeatGate` it grades | **done**, and predates this phase (moved on from `app/playback.rs` in phase 10 when the item context-menu surface needed the same cadence) |
| `hud_visibility_tests` | `app/playback.rs` | `screens/player/input.rs` | **done**, phase 9 — not one of D8's six named modules, listed here because it is the model the six are meant to follow |

`ci/check-deps.sh`'s `testmod` gate counts `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks in `app/mod.rs` and requires 0.
It was red at 4 for two phases and is green now. The gate is the thing to trust rather than this
table: a count in prose is a measurement nothing re-takes.
