note and the version bump. Delete these comments. The standard is README.md in this directory.

You are writing the half no command can produce: what a human saw on a television, what somebody
else reported, and what this release deliberately did not do. Everything measurable is generated
into the block at the bottom by `ci/gen-release-audit.py` during the release run — do not type a
hash, a size, a file list, a DT_NEEDED entry or a firmware verdict anywhere in this file.

Preview the generated half against a previous release at any time:

# Release audit — vX.Y.Z

The evidence behind [the vX.Y.Z release note](https://github.com/sostk/native-jelly/blob/main/docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md). Written for a webosbrew reviewer, a contributor auditing an old release, and us in a year. The section at the bottom is generated from the artifact that was published; everything above it was written by a person before the release ran.

## Device test evidence

<The only grade of whether video plays, and the only thing here a machine cannot produce.>

| | |
|---|---|
| television | <model, platform release as the set reports it, what LG markets the generation as> |
| server | <what the suite ran against> |
| suite | `./tests/run.py --server` — <n> cases, <result>, <date> |
| suite | `./tests/run.py` (synthetic pipeline tier, no Plex) — <n> cases, <result>, <date> |
| perf | `./tests/run.py --fps` — <result>, or why it was not run |
| by hand | <anything watched by a person that the suites do not cover, with what was seen> |

<One paragraph on anything the runs do not settle: a case that was skipped and why, a shape the library does not contain, a tier that is structurally blind to what this release changed.>

## External compatibility reports known at release time

<Every third-party report this release's compatibility claim rests on: who reported it as a profile link rather than a GitHub mention, which set, which platform release, which version they ran, the date, a link, and what they actually saw. Never generalise one to its neighbours. If there are none, say so — an empty section here is itself a fact about how much is known.>

## Compatibility tiers, and what moved

<Which tier each firmware sits in, and — for anything that changed since the previous release — the single piece of evidence that moved it. One television moves one line. A static check never moves a playback line.>

## Known issues at release, with provenance

<Each defect the note lists, with where it was measured, on what, and whether this release changes it. This is where the measurement lives; the note carries the sentence a user needs.>

## Deliberately not done

<Anything a reviewer might expect and not find: a fix that was proven and not taken, a check that does not run, a claim that was available and was not made. State it here rather than letting it be discovered.>

## Release configuration

| | |
|---|---|
| flavour | `com.sostk.nativejelly` (stable) — the id users install; `FLAVOR: stable` is pinned in the release workflow's build job |
| cargo features | `RELEASE=1`, which drops `devtools` and `devtriggers` |
| built by | GitHub Actions, from the tag, at a path identical on every runner |
| toolchain | webOS NDK <version if it moved>, Rust nightly pinned by date in the `RUST_NIGHTLY` repository variable |

<Anything unusual about this build: a toolchain bump, a dependency change, a new payload file, a new outbound host, a new file written outside the app's own directory. If none, say none — the sentence is what makes the absence checkable.>

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED — ci/gen-release-audit.py. Do not edit by hand. -->

*(This block is written by the release workflow from the published artifact. A release audit whose generated half is still this placeholder did not go through `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which is itself worth knowing.)*
