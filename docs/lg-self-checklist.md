# LG App Self Checklist — measured state, item by item

**The checklist is a submission document, not an internal confidence score.** LG names it as a
required webOS TV submission document, and its own preamble requires every item to be marked Pass or
N/A before submission. An unrun item cannot honestly be marked Pass; a Fail must be debugged before
submission.

Checklist version 5.0 (updated 2022-09-27), 53 items. Status taken **2026-08-24** against the
integrated release candidate documented by this commit.

Native eligibility is no longer the open question this file used to describe. Seller Lounge accepts
this IPK as **File Type: Native** and asks for its native SDK version, chipset and resolution; see
`docs/distribution.md` §2. The remaining questions are QA and submission-readiness questions.

## 1. Integrated-plan completion is not LG submission readiness

The Claude integration plan is complete in this tree: T2/T4/T3/T3b and PR #60 are present. Its
measured gates are:

- host `make check`: **1215/1215** tests passed;
- harness unit suite: **62/62** passed;
- `--no-default-features`: green;
- ARM cross-build: green;
- firmware compatibility: **OK for webOS 4.4.2 through 11.2.0**;
- exact television/debug build: synthetic **21/21**, server **21/21**, and `--fps-player`
  **16/16**.

Those results prove a great deal about this exact integrated implementation. They do **not** turn an
unrun LG item into Pass, do not substitute for Store-distribution evidence, and do not resolve a
submission-policy conflict. The exact television run was the debug build; the release configuration
was type-checked and cross-built, not silently treated as the same artefact.

## 2. Remaining submission blockers — NOT DONE

### #53 — factory reset, then execute the app: EXTERNAL EVIDENCE UNAVAILABLE

Native Store submission is possible, but this item cannot be answered with a Developer Mode or
Homebrew sideload: a factory reset removes that installation route. It needs an actual
Store-distributed build, followed by factory reset, install/restore through the supported
distribution channel, and launch. That distribution evidence is not available yet, so this row is
Open rather than N/A.

### Root BACK on the entry page: all four roots covered as of 2026-09-07, device evidence not taken for the fourth

This was a submission-policy blocker in addition to the numbered checklist: the app raised a
Cancel/Exit confirmation at Home root, where the webOS 23–25 submission expectation says entry-page
BACK must show the television Home screen. The confirmation is gone. BACK at each of the THREE
roots implemented 2026-09-03 — Home, the who's-watching picker, the QR sign-in — calls
`webos::go_home`, which asks SAM to launch the Home launcher and leaves the process running
(`docs/remote-keys.md` §8). **The first-run consent question was the fourth root and was NOT
covered as of that date; it was closed 2026-09-07 in the phase 5b restructure**, when the question
stopped being a `Popover` (`ui/consent.rs`, whose `on_back` returned a bare `bool` that could not
tell "stepped back a stage" from "the platform took the screen" — which is exactly the ambiguity
that had kept a BACK-arm fix out of reach) and became an owned screen (`screens/consent.rs`) that
answers with a request instead: BACK at the first stage asks the loop for the same `LoopReq` the
other three roots use, going to television Home without answering or dismissing the question, so
selecting the app's tile again returns straight to it. Proven on the host
(`app/bridge.rs`'s `back_at_the_first_consent_stage_is_the_root_press_and_leaves_the_question_up`);
**no device evidence has been taken for this fourth root**, same gap as the picker's root and the
webOS 5+ full-screen-launcher case noted below.

**Device evidence, taken 2026-09-04 on the dev set (webOS 4.10.2), for Home's root and the QR
sign-in:** `gohome: SAM accepted in 16ms → {"returnValue":true}`, the launcher visible in the
capture — as the RIBBON over the still-drawing app, which is what the HOME key shows on this
firmware — `fuser` reporting the SAME pid before, after, and after a SAM `launch` of the app's own
id brought it back with no ribbon. There is NO `LIFECYCLE: background` line on this firmware and
there cannot be: the webOS 4 launcher is an overlay and the app never leaves the foreground, so a
grader waiting for that line reads a working root press as a failure (this paragraph asked for it
until the session that took the evidence). The pid is the assertion, not the screen. It took a plain
anonymous `LSRegister` to get here — until that session the app's registration was refused by the
hub and the press fell through to an `SDL_MinimizeWindow` that did nothing; `webos::ls2`'s module
doc has the table. `tv-session.sh up` cannot prove any of this because it closes the app first and
waits for a CHANGED pid; the who's-watching picker's root and a webOS 5+ set (full-screen launcher,
where a background event IS expected) are still unmeasured.

## 3. Device evidence still unknown — do not mark Pass

| # | Item | Evidence still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | Reboot / lifecycle | Run the native **16-case lifecycle matrix**: remote power off/on, AC unplug/replug, Recent List close/relaunch, and both launch paths. Verify every cold relaunch settles on the credential-selected Home route (never an old Detail/Library page), while an app switch with the process still alive preserves the separate suspended-playback resume path. `handlesRelaunch: false` and `nativeLifeCycleInterfaceVersion: 2` do not answer native behaviour by themselves. |
| 13 | LockUp / LatchUp | Run the exact **4-hour continuous soak**: `nativejelly-homeosc` grid sweep for 1 h, full-length playback for 2 h, then `nativejelly-navosc` route bounce for 1 h. Check `fuser` liveness and the crash log at every hand-off. Time accumulated during unrelated testing is not this evidence. |
| 14 | Abnormal end | Run wired and wireless, each with static and dynamic IP, while applying the reproducible `rate:` and `blackhole` failure modes. The proxy can create the condition; it cannot reconfigure the television's network. |
| 15 | Keyboard cursor/editing | On the LG VKB, verify cursor movement and editing with `<` and `>` rather than inferring SDL event delivery from the host simulator. |
| 16 | Keyboard character fidelity | Type the checklist's literal `\` example and verify case transfer on the television. |
| 17 | Keyboard linked buttons | Exercise Voice Search and the LG VKB's other linked buttons on the television. |
| 20 / 43 | Remote server reachability | With the LAN route blocked, sign in, browse and play from the account's remote server. Record the winning HTTPS `plex.direct` origin in the event log. HTTPS control, TLS media, relay fallback and persisted per-server state are implemented, but this exact acceptance run is still owed. |
| 43 CASE2 | IPv6 | Browse and play over a **v6-only route**. `AF_UNSPEC`, IPv6 URL bracketing and both address families are implemented and host-tested; that is not an on-device IPv6 playback result. |
| 22 CASE2 | Unsupported-language search | Enter a CJK query and visually verify Han/Kana/Hangul text rather than tofu. The bundled fallback font and per-run fallback renderer are host-gated; RTL remains explicitly outside that claim. |
| 26 | General IR remote | Capture every physical button on a standard IR remote, slowly and in recorded order, and decode the raw scancode/symbol pairs. The Magic Remote capture is complete; the IR remote is not. |
| 36 / 39 | HOME and LIVE keys | Include HOME and LIVE in that capture and record what the platform actually delivers or consumes. They are intentionally not guessed or bound from web keycodes. |
| 40 | Unsupported keys | Sweep unsupported keys on normal routes and during playback; verify they move no focus, wake no player HUD, and cancel no armed press. Host invariants do not observe the real remote or video HUD. |

### Unnumbered release evidence still owed

These are not converted into numbered checklist failures, but they remain explicit release risks:

- cancel an in-flight DNS lookup and an in-flight TLS handshake on the television, proving prompt
  teardown with no stranded worker;
- resolve and play a hostname through the app's glibc NSS path. LG libcurl's c-ares result does not
  prove glibc NSS works inside the native jail;
- measure the integrated build's worst-path `VmHWM` through playback with the CJK fallback exercised
  and confirm it remains below `requiredMemory: 160`. The earlier approximately 152 MiB peak predates
  the fully exercised bundled CJK face and is not sufficient evidence for this build;
- install the packaged IPK — **install, not deploy** — switch the set to Korean, and verify the
  launcher/listing keeps `PlxNative debug` while using the Korean description. Re-check after reboot
  for SAM caching and try the documented region-qualified resource layouts if bare `ko` is ignored.

## 4. Newly device-passing on 2026-08-24

| # | Item | Measured basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 43 CASE1 | Adaptive resolution under four shaped links | **Pass on this television.** Auto starts from a conservative 720 Kbps/480p request when nothing about the link is knowable for free, measures segment throughput, PMS production time and normalized A/V buffer time, and primes a separately named fixed-rendition encoder before switching. `tools/netcond.py` produced the required results: 512 Kbps → 320 Kbps / actual 320×134; 1 Mbps → 720 Kbps / actual 480×200; 7 Mbps → 4 Mbps / actual 1280×536; 17.5 Mbps → 8 Mbps / actual 1920×804. A live high-to-512 Kbps collapse jumped directly to the sustainable floor rather than downloading oversized intermediate rungs. All switches stayed inside one Starfish Load, the full 1:40:03 duration remained stable, and a mid-movie seek resumed on the correct HLS segment. **Those four settle values were measured on the six-rung ladder of that day**; the controller was rewritten on 2026-08-25 onto a 13-point catalog, where the 17.5 Mbit/s leg would land on the 10 Mbps rung instead of 8. That is the one number here the rewrite is expected to change, and it has not been re-measured on a device — the checklist item is about adapting to the shaped link, which each leg still demonstrates. |
| 46 | Replay after completion | **Pass on this television.** The synthetic suite ran `pipe_finish_eos` and `pipe_replay_after_eos`: the 20 s clip reached `EOS reached → ended`, tore down, re-entered exactly once, produced a second Load and fixture fetch, and its media position fell and climbed again. This proves trigger-driven direct-play replay; user-driven and transcode replay remain useful extra coverage, not a reason to erase this measured result. |
| 50 / 51 | Resolution × codec | **Pass on this television.** All eight SD 720×480 / HD 1280×720 / FHD 1920×1080 / UHD 3840×2160 × {H.264, HEVC} cells passed, each grading exact `expect.video_size`. The 4096-wide boundary, refusal above it, and a real PMS decision for generated-only shapes remain outside this matrix. |

The complete debug-device evidence behind those rows is broader than the two checklist closures:

- synthetic **21/21** proves transport, demux, feed, codec declarations, EOS/replay, seek, frame-rate
  fixtures, and the exact resolution matrix;
- server **21/21** proves the live Plex selection path, direct play/transcode decisions, PlayQueue,
  track selection, markers, resume and timeline reporting for the configured library;
- `--fps-player` **16/16** proves every configured UI and player performance scene met its gate on
  this television.

Synthetic and server tiers are complements. A future run with skipped server shapes must report the
skips; a partial green count is not equivalent to 21/21.

## 5. Other passing items and their evidence

| # | Item | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2 | Execution, main screen | Repeated device-suite launches reached the intended route. The 1920×1080 UI is held inside the 5% overscan frame by `MARGIN_X` 96 / `MARGIN_Y` 54 and the composed-geometry host gate. The splash is 1920×1080 and uses the app surface rather than a black field. |
| 6 | Correct text | `text::elide`, long-form scrolling, synthesized music-note glyphs, and the bundled CJK fallback cover the implemented scripts. The separate CJK visual acceptance run in §3 is still owed; this row does not claim RTL support. |
| 7 | Focus / mouse-over | Idle, focused and selected states are distinct and were audited screen by screen at 1920×1080; the 16/16 FPS run exercised the integrated focus/transition scenes. |
| 8 | Flickering | No flicker was observed in the completed device matrices; the known Dolby Vision Profile 5 pulse is fixed. |
| 9 | Full-size video | Video track and plane are full-panel 1920×1080 with no application margin. |
| 21 | Sign out | `ui/account_menu.rs` reaches `auth::sign_out`; session removal is host-gated. |
| 27–31, 33 | Magic Remote, pointer, OK, wheel, navigation | Pointer/click and wheel paths are device-proven; the Magic Remote raw capture contains 336 real key lines. |
| 37 | BACK within the app | BACK returns through the route trail. Home-root behaviour is the separate policy blocker in §2 and is not hidden by this Pass. |
| 38 | EXIT key | Scancode 505 is bound and device-verified: press → `EXIT key: terminating` → no process. |
| 45 (remote half) | Playback control keys | Native scancodes for play/pause, stop, rewind and fast-forward are bound and device-proven. The absence of an on-screen transport row is documented in the submitted UX scenario rather than disguised as an implementation gap. |
| 48 | Subtitles | The server matrix passed text and image subtitle paths; music-note coverage is bundled. Subtitle-appearance settings are N/A because the app exposes none. |
| 49 | Resume | The server matrix passed the PMS-backed `viewOffset` resume path; the harness resets state through `/:/unscrobble`. |

## 6. Decisions and N/A items

**#41 — language setting.** Settings now offers System default, English, Spanish and Belarusian,
with changes applied at the next app launch. Localized launcher metadata still follows webOS.
The native Settings Service supplies UI and formatting locales, and the resolved app language
becomes `X-Plex-Language` for PMS. Native device checks on 2026-09-27 verified detection, persistence across restarts, Cyrillic
text, consent scrolling and the contribution QR. See `docs/localization.md` for the scope.

**#45 — on-screen transport controls.** The product deliberately uses a remote-driven, state-only
transport HUD rather than a focusable Play/Pause/Stop/FF/RW row. The compliance description belongs
in `docs/ux-scenario.md`, which is what the checklist tells QA to consult for movement details.

Genuinely N/A: #4 advertisement · #11 BACK UI button · #12 EXIT UI button · #18 terms · #19 sign-up
(account creation happens on plex.tv) · #23 adult authentication · #24 / #25 payment · #32 colour
keys (unused) · #35 MMRC-only restriction · #42 in-app UI sound control (there is no UI audio) · #44
full/original screen toggle · #47 live/real-time TV streaming · #48 subtitle appearance settings ·
#52 DRM.

## 7. Release verdict at this snapshot

The integrated implementation and its automated/device suites are green. The LG submission is
**not ready**: Store factory-reset evidence is unavailable, and root BACK — implemented against the
policy at three of its four roots since 2026-09-03, and at all four since the first-run consent
question closed 2026-09-07 (§2 above) — still has NO device evidence for that fourth root (nor for
the who's-watching picker's, nor for a webOS 5+ full-screen-launcher set), so the unrun device
evidence in §3 cannot honestly be marked Pass. Automatic ABR and LG #43 CASE1 are no
longer blockers. Keep plan completion and submission readiness separate when reporting status.
