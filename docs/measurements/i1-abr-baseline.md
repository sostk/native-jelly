# I1 — ABR baseline on unmodified policy

**Device session 2026-08-26.** LG 49SM9000PLA, webOS 4.10.0, `com.beb.nativejelly.debug`.
Binary: `5a8ef2ef` + I0 (`88b5d738`) + I0 amendments (`3f9ce72b`) — instrumentation only, no ABR
policy change. Host suite at that SHA: 1272 Rust + 98 harness green.

Raw `abr: sample` traces for the census points are beside this file (`raw-<pin>.txt`).

## Purpose

Record what the CURRENT controller does, before any of increments I3-I8 change it. Nothing here
is a threshold and nothing here was graded — every ABR bound in the manifest is still absent by
design (`test_no_manifest_case_carries_a_new_abr_bound_yet`).

## M2 — the four shaped cases (all PASS)

| case | rungs | settled | commits | min_buf | max_stall | first segment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pipe_abr_slow_start_then_fast` | — | — | — | — | — | buf=2000ms current=720 -> **prime_down 320** |
| `pipe_abr_steady_modest_link` | — | — | — | — | — | buf=2000ms current=2000 -> **prime_down 720** |
| `pipe_abr_brief_dropout` | — | — | — | — | — | buf=2000ms current=10000 -> **prime_down 8000** |
| `pipe_abr_oscillating_link` | — | — | — | — | — | buf=2000ms current=6000 -> **prime_down 4000** |

(The rung/commit columns were not captured on this pass: `report_case` prints the metric story
only under `--verbose`, and the first four runs were not verbose. Re-run with `--verbose` to fill
them; the characterisation lines above were printed unconditionally and are the load-bearing part.)

Every run also printed `history: switches=1 since_last=<ms> advanced=0ms`.

## M4 — the buffer census

Unshaped LAN measured 103-111 Mbit/s. Pins 720 and 4000 additionally carry a flat shaped leg
(6000 / 20000 kbps) — see the limitation note below; the shaper sets the FILL rate and is far
above the media rate, so the queue is still what bounds the reserve SIZE, which the agreement
below confirms.

Predictions are computed from queue geometry alone — `aq_caps()`, `MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS`,
`AUDIO_SLACK_NS` and the MEASURED media and audio rates. No controller helper is involved. The
elementary rate is taken as `(media - audio) / 1.04`, because the AU queues hold demuxed
elementary bytes while `media=` is measured off the TS wire.

| pin | media kbps | audio kbps | video ES | pred video | pred audio | **prediction** | **observed median** | err | binding lane |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 720 | 1381 | 131 | 1202 | 57 431 | 67 635 | **57 431** | **59 001** | +2.7% | video 85/85 |
| 4000 | 3183 | 160 | 2907 | 24 685 | 56 028 | **24 685** | **24 835** | +0.6% | video 70/70 |
| 20000 | 18456 | 192 | 17 562 | 5 421 | 47 290 | **5 421** | **5 335** | -1.6% | video 57/57 |

Distributions (settled rung, first quarter discarded as queue fill-in):

| pin | n | p10 | median | p90 | max |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 720 | 56 | 50 085 | 59 001 | 59 085 | 59 085 |
| 4000 | 53 | 24 751 | 24 835 | 24 918 | 24 918 |
| 20000 | 43 | 5 293 | 5 335 | 5 460 | 5 460 |

`dur=2000ms` on every sample at every rung — the server's `EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:2` was honoured
and never varied.

### The two guard collisions, measured

| rung | max reserve | `buffered >= 3*segment` (6000 ms) | `starving()` 6000 ms band |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 720 | 59 085 | satisfiable | not armed |
| 4000 | 24 918 | satisfiable | not armed |
| **20000** | **5 460** | **UNSATISFIABLE** | **permanently armed** |

## Limitations of this session

* Only 3 of the 7 census points were measured. Unshaped, the controller starts at the TOP rung
  (the LAN measures 84-111 Mbit/s, so `startup_rung` picks 20000), and the pin cannot transact
  from there: `PIN_MIN_RESERVE_SEGMENTS` needs six segments of reserve, which is unreachable above
  ~11 Mbit/s of media. Pins 720 and 4000 were reached only by shaping the link so the run STARTS
  low. ~~Measuring 320 / 2000 / 10000 / 16000 needs the pin applied at the ROUTE's starting ceiling
  rather than as a transaction — an I0 follow-up, not a policy change.~~ **Both halves wrong,
  settled 2026-08-27.** It WAS a policy change: the six-segment figure is an upshift derivation
  charged in both directions, and splitting it (`PIN_MIN_RESERVE_SEGMENTS_DOWN = 2`, 4 000 ms,
  inside `B_max` at every rung) was the whole fix. All four rungs were then measured with the pin
  applied as an ordinary prime/validate/commit transaction, unshaped —
  `docs/measurements/p2-census.md` §0.
* Segment-duration sensitivity (I1-D) was NOT measured. `serve_fixtures.py` hard-codes
  `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:2` over 2 s clips; a 4 s leg needs new fixtures. Deferred, not inferred.
* Seek (I1-E) was NOT exercised: one `abr: seed` line per run, no seek operation. Deferred.
* Mode-switch decay (I1-F): the INPUT is confirmed zero (`advanced=0ms`, every run), but no
  HLS -> Original -> HLS round trip was produced, so the decay's behaviour over wall time is
  still unobserved.

# Addendum — M2 re-run with `--verbose --no-early`

**Second device session, same day, same binary** (`pkg/nativejelly` md5 verified identical on the
television before the run). This fills the gap the M2 table above records as `—`.

**It is a SECOND RUN, not a recovery of the first one's numbers.** The trajectories below are not
the ones the earlier early-exit runs produced and must not be read as such — see "what the window
length changes" below. Raw console output: `m2-verbose-rerun.txt` beside this file.

## The four cases

| case | rungs | settled | commits | trail | min_buf | dip_max | max_stall | raster changes | segs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pipe_abr_slow_start_then_fast` | 320–20000 | 18000 | **7** | d320 u720 u20000 d18000 d16000 d14000 u18000 | 2000 | n/a (flat) | 0 s | 2 | 34 |
| `pipe_abr_steady_modest_link` | 720–2000 | 2000 | 2 | d720 u2000 | 2000 | n/a (flat) | 0 s | 1 | 44 |
| `pipe_abr_brief_dropout` | 4000–18000 | 14000 | 6 | d8000 d4000 u18000 d16000 d14000 u18000 | 2000 | **9265** (1 seg over the 200 kbps leg) | 1 s | 2 | 37 |
| `pipe_abr_oscillating_link` | 720–6000 | 720 | 7 | d4000 u10000 d6000 d2000 u10000 d2000 d720 | 2000 | see note | 0 s | 5 | 40 |
| `pipe_abr_oscillating_link` (2nd) | 720–4000 | 720 | 3 | d4000 d2000 d720 | 2000 | **3183** (39 segs over the 3×3000 kbps legs) | 0 s | 1 | 61 |

`min_buf_ms` is 2000 in every case, and it is always the FIRST sample: the reserve starts at one
segment and grows from there, so the minimum is structural rather than a drawdown.

## What the window length changes

`pipe_abr_slow_start_then_fast` **FAILED** here (`7 rung changes, want <= 5`) and PASSED in the
earlier early-exit run. Nothing regressed: the early-exit run stopped at 50 s of a 90 s cap as
soon as every assertion held, and `max_commits` counts events over whatever window it was given.
**A commit-count bound is window-length sensitive, and an early-exit run under-counts it.** Any
later comparison against this baseline has to hold the window fixed.

`pipe_abr_oscillating_link` was run twice and produced 7 commits then 3, on the same profile and
the same binary. Run-to-run variance on this case is large; a single reading of it is not a
measurement.

## A harness bug found and fixed during this session

The first pass reported `dip_max_kbps=n/a (no degraded leg in the injected profile)` for all four
cases, including two that plainly have one. Cause: `_dip_windows` was captured only inside the
early-exit evaluator, which `--no-early` never calls. Fixed by capturing the shaper's schedule on
the verdict path as well; the two cases with degraded legs were then re-run, and the values in the
table above are from after the fix. The other two cases are genuinely flat and correctly report
`n/a`.

## The top-rung guard collision, visible in the trails

Two of the four trails reach 20000 or 18000 and then walk straight back DOWN — `u20000 d18000
d16000 d14000` and `u18000 d16000 d14000`. That is the shape §0.3(2) predicts and the census
measured: at those rungs the reachable reserve is under 6000 ms, so `starving()`'s second arm is
permanently armed and the `buffered >= 3*segment` upshift gate cannot be satisfied. Recorded as an
observation; no threshold is proposed here.
