There are now two evidence paths. When crash-report consent and a compiled endpoint are both
present, the patched Sentry Native ARM32 handler wakes the shipped `sentry-crash` process. That
process reads the stopped target, walks the crashing thread's frame chain from a copy of its
stack, and unwinds every other Linux LWP remotely through libunwind's ptrace accessors (DWARF,
with function names), attaching and detaching per thread. It records up to 128 frames for the
crashing thread plus up to 32 for each other thread, registers, modules, Linux/webOS versions and
build ids. Its transport is disabled; the next
healthy PlxNative launch sanitises the envelope and sends it from the ordinary telemetry spool.
That Sentry event **is a
backtrace** when it contains multiple frames.

The local, always-available fallback is the C tracer (`src/crashtrace.c`). It catches the fatal
signals, writes what it knows, then **re-raises to `SIG_DFL`** so SAM sees a real `WIFSIGNALED`
death — and **not** so a crash daemon
produces a backtrace, which on this firmware it never does (see §"do not go looking for a crashd
backtrace" above; `core_pattern` is the bare string `core` and `RLIMIT_CORE` is 0, so no core is
written and the report chain never starts). Per crash it emits:

```
*** SIGNAL 11 (SIGSEGV) addr=0x6bcf pc=0xf5a4dd08 lr=0x0
reg: sp=0x… fp=0x… ip=0x… cpsr=0x… r0=0x… r1=0x… … r10=0x…
at:  <the /proc/self/maps line containing pc or lr>    -- which library faulted
bin: <the maps line for our own executable>            -- our load base, for addr2line
```

Turning `pc` into a source location needs `pc - load_base` fed to `addr2line`. Nothing in
the repo did that arithmetic until `tools/crash-report.sh`.

**Call the local C record a FAULT EVENT, not a backtrace, when you write it up.** Two frames and the
registers are what an async-signal-safe handler can honestly produce: `backtrace()` is not on the safe list, ARM
unwinding out of a handler commonly stops at `gsignal()`, and deferring does not help because by
then the stack is gone.

**And do not go looking for a crashd backtrace to fill the gap — you will not get one.** Device-
verified 2026-08-29 with a deliberate SIGSEGV: the re-raise gets SAM a real `exit_status: 11`, and
`/var/log/reports/librdx/` stays empty. `core_pattern` here is the bare string `core`, so the report
chain begins with a core FILE, and every build that is not `DEBUG=1` sets `RLIMIT_CORE` to 0 — for
good reason, on a 615.6 MB partition shared with every installed app that had 125.9 MB free. So the
fault event below IS the evidence. Treat an empty librdx directory as expected, not as a clue.

**A log from before 2026-08-29 has no crashd report to go with it, whatever this page says about
the re-raise.** The re-raise was added on 2026-07-09 and did not work: `sigaction` masks the signal
inside its own handler, so `raise()` only marked it pending and the `_exit(128 + sig)` below it ran
— a clean exit, no core, no `/var/log/reports/librdx/` entry, `WIFEXITED` for SAM. So when triaging
an old crash, **read a SAM `exit_status` of 35584 as a SIGSEGV** (`139 << 8`), 34304 as a SIGABRT
(`134 << 8`), and do not conclude from an absent crashd report that the process did not take a
signal. It was found by `ci/crashtrace-test.c`, which faults a process on purpose and asks how it
died — the one question the crash log cannot answer about itself. (The *other* half of that
change, making the handler async-signal-safe, was not a discovery at all: it is finding C3 of
`docs/architecture-review-2026-07-26.md`, filed five weeks earlier and left undone.)

The `reg:` line arrived with the same change (the rewrite that made the handler actually
async-signal-safe — it had been calling `fprintf`/`fopen`/`sscanf`), so an older log will not have
it. **Read it when the PC does not resolve**: r0-r3 are the first four arguments at
the call, `fp`/`sp` bound the frame, and a `cpsr` with bit 5 set says the fault was in Thumb code.

All paths are relative to the repo root. The TV address comes from the `Makefile`
(override with `TV=…`); no addresses or credentials live in this skill.

## First: which install crashed

Three builds can be on this television — `com.sostk.nativejelly` (stable, what users install),
`com.sostk.nativejelly.debug` (the developer build beside it, and the Makefile's **default**), and
`com.sostk.nativejelly.nightly` (the nightly build, its own install beside the other two). Each has
its own app directory, its own runtime root and therefore its own **crash log**, so triaging the
wrong one produces a clean bill of health for an app that is dying. Ask the Makefile rather than
typing a path:

```bash
make -s print-appid    FLAVOR=debug     # com.sostk.nativejelly.debug
make -s print-appdir   FLAVOR=debug     # where the binary and the .so files are
make -s print-rundir   FLAVOR=debug     # /tmp/com.sostk.nativejelly.debug   (stable: /tmp)
make -s print-eventlog FLAVOR=debug
```

Not `make -p`/`make -pn`: that prints a recursive variable's UNEXPANDED DEFINITION, so `TV` comes
back as the literal `$(strip $(shell cat .tv-host …))` and every ssh built from it fails — which
reads as an unreachable television and sends you to `wake-tv` for a set that is already awake.

## Run this first

```bash
tools/crash-report.sh [--flavor <f>]  # evidence + symbolize the most recent crash
tools/crash-report.sh --all           # every crash in the persistent log
tools/crash-report.sh --collect       # evidence bundle only, no symbolization
```

It checks reachability, compares the local and deployed binary md5, checks codegen,
prints the crash block, symbolizes `pc`/`lr` **only when they fall inside our mapping**,
and then dumps stderr, the SAM exit status and the crash-daemon reports.

## Rule out the impostors before believing a crash

1. **Is the TV awake?** A sleeping TV makes *every* log assertion fail as "no line
   found" — a whole FPS suite reported `0 fps samples` on five scenes for this reason,
   which reads exactly like a total regression. Wake it (`wake-tv` skill) and re-run
   before triaging anything.
2. **Is the deployed binary the one you built?** A standby can truncate an scp mid-deploy.
   The driver md5-compares; on mismatch, symbolized addresses are meaningless. With two
   installs the check is **necessary but no longer sufficient**: `pkg/nativejelly` is a path
   every flavour and both configurations write, so a MATCH proves the bytes and not the
   install, and a MISMATCH is at least as likely to mean you are pointed at the other app as
   at a bad scp. Settle it with the `install:` line, not by deploying — see the table below.
   `pidof nativejelly` cannot settle it either: both binaries carry that name, so on this
   busybox set it returns two pids in an order nothing promises. Liveness is
   `fuser $(make -s print-appdir FLAVOR=<f>)/nativejelly`, which is inode-scoped.
3. **Did it actually crash?** SAM keeps stale "running" state after a hard kill, so a
   launch can be a silent no-op relaunch. Check the SAM `exit_status` in the driver's
   output: a clean exit shows `exit_status: 0`; `768` is `exit(3)`; a signal death shows
   up as `WIFSIGNALED` in the low byte.

## Read the right log

These files live in the crashing install's **runtime root** — `/tmp` for stable, `/tmp/<app id>` for
a flavoured install (`make -s print-rundir FLAVOR=<f>`). The file names are identical in both, so
a path typed from memory reads the wrong app's log without erroring.

| Log | Lifetime |
|---|---|
| `<rundir>/nativejelly-crash.log` | **append-only, survives the relaunch** — read this after a crash+restart |
| `<rundir>/nativejelly-events.log` | truncated at every launch — after a relaunch it is already gone |
| `<rundir>/nativejelly-stderr.log` | where Rust panics print |
| `<rundir>/nativejelly-diag.log` | atomically replaced storage-stage snapshot, 0640, at most 16 KiB; no account data or paths |

Events, crash and stderr remain 0600. The storage snapshot is group-readable for a shell sharing
its gid and records build identity, directory write probes and helper/activation outcomes. A failed
publication preserves the prior snapshot; it is not proof that the current process reached startup.

**The event log's FIRST line names the install**, before anything can fail, so use it to identify the crashing process:

```
install: id=com.sostk.nativejelly.debug flavour=debug runtime=/tmp/com.sostk.nativejelly.debug features=dev APPID_env=…
appdir: /media/… (from current_exe)
```

`features=` is `dev` or `release`, which also settles "is this the shipped configuration?" without
a hash.

**The crash log is the one that survives, and it carries no `install:` line** — the tracer runs in
C, before and independently of any of that. What it does carry is the `bin:` maps line, which is
the full path of the faulting executable and therefore names the app directory, i.e. the id. Match
it anchored (`/<id>/`) and it is as good a witness as the event log's; read it as a bare substring
and it is worse than none, for the reason in the gotchas below.

## Route by signal

- **SIGSEGV / SIGBUS (11 / 7)** — bad pointer or a wrong struct offset. If the `at:` line
  shows the PC inside a **TV shared library**, there are no symbols for it and it is
  almost never their bug: it is a bad argument or a wrong offset on the call path into
  that library. Go to the `bind-tv-lib-abi` skill and re-verify every offset on that path.
  If the PC is inside our binary, the symbolized frame is the site.
- **SIGILL (4)** — suspect *codegen*, not logic. The default ARMv6 codegen emits a CP15
  barrier that is undefined on this SoC. The driver prints the CP15 instruction count
  (must be `0`) and the CPU arch tag (must be `v7`); a stale hand-built staticlib is the
  usual cause. No log will tell you this.
- **SIGABRT / SIGTRAP (6 / 5)** — usually a **Rust panic** crossing the FFI boundary. The
  PC is inside `abort()` and is worthless; the evidence is `<rundir>/nativejelly-stderr.log`.
- **SIGFPE / SIGSYS (8 / 31)** — arithmetic trap or a rejected system call. They are uncommon,
  but both Sentry and the local tracer cover them so an internal daemon write failure still leaves
  a bounded record.
- **No signal at all, app just gone** — not a caught crash. Check the SAM exit status, an
  OOM/memchute kill, or a deliberate close.

## Symbolization: what you get

The release build has **no DWARF**, so `addr2line` resolves the **function name** only
(`nj_run at ??:?`). That is usually enough to route.

For **file:line**, rebuild with debug info:

```bash
make DEBUG=1                       # C frames resolve immediately
touch rust-modules/src/lib.rs && make DEBUG=1   # also force the Rust rebuild
make FLAVOR=<f> deploy             # the SAME flavour you are triaging, then reproduce
```

`make` does not track `RUSTFLAGS` changes, so the Rust staticlib will not rebuild on its
own — hence the `touch`. Verified output after that: `nj_run at rust-modules/src/port.rs:<line>` (it read `app.rs:248` before phase 1a moved the file, then `app/mod.rs`, before step L15 put the C entry in the port),
`main at src/main.c:92`. Same codegen, larger binary; deploy it only while chasing a crash.

## Prove the tracer works before reading its silence

An empty `nativejelly-crash.log` means one of two things and they are opposite: nothing crashed, or
the recorder is broken. **Two of the three ways this recorder can be broken have actually happened**
— it spent seven weeks re-raising nothing, and before that it `_exit(3)`d — and in both cases the
log looked entirely normal. So when a crash is suspected and the log is empty, fault the app on
purpose and check the recorder end to end.

```bash
tools/tv-lock.sh acquire --why "prove the crash tracer"
make deploy                                     # a devtriggers build; RELEASE=1 compiles this out
RUN=$(make -s print-rundir)
tools/tv-ssh ssh tv "echo segv > $RUN/nativejelly-crashtest"
make run RUN_SECS=12                            # it will die at once, on purpose
tools/crash-report.sh                           # the record, symbolized
```

Four things to check, and the third and fourth are the ones no host test can reach:

1. `crashtest: DELIBERATE crash, kind=segv signal=11` in the event log — so nobody later mistakes
   this for the bug they were hunting.
2. `*** SIGNAL 11 (SIGSEGV) addr=0x0 pc=0x… lr=0x…` in the crash log, with a `reg:` line under it.
3. **`at:` and `bin:` lines.** These come from `/proc/self/maps` and exist on no development Mac;
   `ci/crashtrace-test.c` grades the reader against fixtures, but only the set proves it against
   the real file. `bin:` must name the install you deployed to.
4. **A SAM `exit_status` with `WIFSIGNALED` set — and an EMPTY `/var/log/reports/librdx/`.**
   The status is the re-raise and the only thing it buys. The empty directory is the expected
   result, not a clue: no core is written, so no report is ever generated. This step used to demand
   a fresh librdx entry as a PASS criterion, which fails a perfectly healthy tracer and sends you
   hunting a directory that is empty by construction. A status of `35584` means the re-raise
   regressed — that is `(128+11) << 8`, a clean exit wearing a signal's number.

`segv` is a genuine null write, so the PC is a real faulting PC. The other kinds — `abrt`, `bus`,
`ill`, `trap` — go through `raise` and prove five of the seven `sigaction` calls took, but their PC
points into `raise` and is worth nothing.

**Clear the trigger afterwards.** `tests/run.py` sweeps `nativejelly-*` on exit; `make run` does not,
so a by-hand session leaves it armed and the next launch dies too — which reads exactly like the
app having become unlaunchable.

```bash
tools/tv-ssh ssh tv "rm -f $RUN/nativejelly-crashtest"
```

## Gotchas

- **pmlog's wall clock is hours off on this TV.** Correlate by monotonic uptime (the
  bracketed number in `/var/log/messages`) or the app's own `SDL_GetTicks` stamps — never
  by time of day.
- **`lr=0x0` is normal** for a signal delivered asynchronously; only `pc` is meaningful then.
- **There are no system crashd reports to pull.** `/var/log/reports/librdx/` is empty by
  construction and this bullet used to say the opposite — that the re-raise produces real
  backtraces there. Do not confuse LG's absent `crashd` output with the app's shipped
  `sentry-crash` daemon: the latter hands its envelope to the telemetry queue and normally leaves
  no report file behind after a healthy restart. For consent-off/unconfigured builds, use
  `pkg/nativejelly.debug` and `addr2line` on the local fault event.
- **Older notes say `/tmp/poc-*`.** The app was renamed; the names are all `nativejelly-*` now,
  and they sit in the install's runtime root rather than always in `/tmp`.
- **`com.sostk.nativejelly` is a PREFIX of `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`.** Anything that picks a crash
  block, a maps line or a log by app-directory path must anchor on a delimiter — match `/<id>/`,
  never the bare id — or every stable-id filter silently accepts the debug install's evidence too
  and you symbolize one app's addresses against the other's binary. `src/main.c`'s `bin:` matcher
  documents the same trap one level down: it tests `/nativejelly\n` and `/nativejelly ` rather than a
  bare substring, because the app directory is itself named `…com.sostk.nativejelly/` and a loose test
  also matched libraries deployed beside the binary.
- **A guard-page allocator exists** for memory-corruption hunts (`src/gpdebug.c`, never in
  the normal build) — reach for it when a SIGSEGV moves around between runs.
- **`make FLAVOR=<f> uninstall` takes the crash history with it.** It `rm -rf`s that install's
  whole runtime root, and the append-only crash log — the one artifact deliberately built to
  outlive a relaunch — is inside it. Pull anything you still want off the TV first; there is no
  copy anywhere else.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `TV … is unreachable` | Wake it (`wake-tv` skill). Re-run whatever failed *before* concluding anything. |
| `MISMATCH` on the md5 | **Check the flavour before you deploy anything.** With two installs this is routinely "you are looking at the other app", not "the TV has a stale build" — and the old advice here, a bare `make deploy`, would then put your dev build on top of the STABLE install on this skill's own recommendation, destroying a working app to investigate a crash that was never in it. Read the `install:` line of the event log in the runtime root you fetched from, compare it with `make -s print-appid FLAVOR=<f>`, and only once they agree treat the mismatch as a stale or truncated deploy — then `make FLAVOR=<f> deploy` and reproduce. |
| `<appdir> does not exist … not installed` from a deploy | That flavour has never been installed; scp cannot create an app. `make FLAVOR=<f> install` once (`tv-session` skill). |
| Crash log empty but the app died | Not a caught signal — read the SAM exit status and stderr sections of the driver output. |
| `?? ??:0` for an address in our binary | Release build without DWARF. Rebuild with `DEBUG=1` (see above). |
| Every frame says "outside our binary" | The fault is in a TV library; the `at:` line names it. Treat as an ABI/argument bug. |
