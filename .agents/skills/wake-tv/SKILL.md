  Wake the LG webOS dev TV from standby via Wake-on-LAN and wait for
  SSH — run this whenever the TV is unreachable, asleep, timing out, or "connection
  refused / operation timed out" before a deploy, test run, capture, or stream session.
  Also: put the TV into standby, or check whether it is up.

# wake-tv — wake the dev TV before touching it

The LG 49SM9000PLA (rooted, webOS 4.5) **drops to standby after a few idle minutes**.
Every automation session against it — `make deploy` / `make test`, `tests/run.py`,
`tools/capture-screen.sh`, `tools/stream-screen.py` — dies with SSH timeouts when it's
asleep. Wake it first; don't wait for it to wake itself (it won't).

All paths below are relative to the repo root.

## Run (the only path)

```bash
.agents/skills/wake-tv/wake-tv.sh            # wake + wait for ssh; no-op if already up
.agents/skills/wake-tv/wake-tv.sh status     # one probe: UP/DOWN (exit 0 = up)
.agents/skills/wake-tv/wake-tv.sh standby    # clean standby (for testing the cycle)
```

Verified live (three real cycles): wake from **overnight** standby took **18 s**;
wakes from a **fresh** standby took **6 s** and **1 s**. Budget up to ~2–3 min for a
long-cold TV (observed once in earlier sessions) — the driver resends the magic packet
every ~20 s and polls SSH every 3 s, default timeout 180 s (`WAKE_TIMEOUT=300` to
extend). Exit 0 = SSH answers; exit 1 = gave up.

Config resolves at runtime — no network details are stored in the skill. The host
comes from `$TV_HOST`/`$TV`, else the `Makefile`'s `TV` value (the single source of
truth). The MAC needed for the magic packet comes from `$TV_MAC`, else the gitignored
`.tv-mac` cache, else it is read from the ARP table while the TV is reachable and
cached for next time — so the first `wake-tv.sh status` against a live TV is enough to
arm future wakes. `TV_USER` (root) and `WAKE_TIMEOUT` (180) are the other overrides.

No prerequisites beyond macOS built-ins (`python3` broadcasts the WoL packet — there is
no `wakeonlan` binary on a stock Mac) and working SSH auth to the TV.

## Gotchas — what standby BREAKS (why you run this first)

- **A deploy can die mid-scp** when the TV sleeps under it. After any interrupted
  `make deploy`, md5-compare before trusting the binary:
  `md5 -q pkg/plxnative` vs `ssh root@TV "md5sum $(make -s print-appdir FLAVOR=<f>)/plxnative"`.
  Spell the app directory that way rather than eliding it: there are two installs on this
  television — `com.sostk.nativejelly` and `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`, the latter being what an
  unflavoured `make deploy` targets — and a hand-typed path compares the wrong one without
  erroring. (`make -s print-*` is a real recipe and side-effect free; **never `make -p`**, which
  prints unexpanded definitions and hands you the literal `$(strip $(shell cat .tv-host …))`.)
- **Standby kills reverse SSH tunnels** (`ssh -R`) and can leave the TV-side
  dropbear holding the stale listen port — the next `-R` fails with
  "remote port forwarding failed". Kill the stale per-connection dropbear on the
  TV (`netstat -tlnp | grep <port>` → kill that pid), then reconnect.
- **Standby closes the app**, so the capture stream port (`:8910` for the stable install,
  `:8911` for debug, `:8912` for nightly — `make -s print-appport FLAVOR=…`), the remote FIFO,
  and any luna-send `-i` launch subscription are gone — relaunch the app after waking.
  **UNVERIFIED — does a standby cycle wipe `/tmp`?** Nothing in this repository observes it
  either way, and it matters more since the runtime root moved: a flavoured install keeps its
  whole root there (`/tmp/<app id>`: triggers, FIFO, logs), and the stable install keeps its
  triggers and all three logs directly in `/tmp`. A wipe would also contradict what three places
  promise about `plxnative-crash.log` being append-only and surviving a relaunch (`docs/agent-reference.md`,
  `crash-triage`, `docs/two-installs.md` §3.1) — though "survives the relaunch" and "survives a
  power cycle" are different claims, and only the first has ever been exercised.
  *Settled by:* before going to standby, note `md5sum` and size of `<rundir>/plxnative-crash.log`
  and `touch <rundir>/plxnative-standbyprobe`; wake, then `ls -la <rundir>`. The crash log
  unchanged and the probe file still present settles it as "not wiped"; either one gone settles
  the opposite. One session, no playback needed.
  Either way you do not need to re-install — the app directory is on flash, not `/tmp` — and
  `tools/tv-session.sh up` recreates the root `1777` and re-arms triggers before every session,
  so the practical procedure is the same under both answers. (The root is mkdir-then-chmod,
  because a umask masks mkdir's mode and the app writes there jailed under its own uid while the
  harness arms triggers there as root.)
- **SSH auth: key first, `sshpass` fallback.** This machine authenticates with an
  installed key. `tools/tv-ssh` (which the driver and the `Makefile` share) tries the key first and
  runs `sshpass` only when the TV refuses it — both work; the key simply wins when present.
- **This webOS 4.5 build's power method is `power/powerOff`** —
  `power/turnOff` (newer webOS docs) returns `Unknown method`.
- **`luna-send` silently no-ops without a controlling TTY** — on-TV calls are wrapped
  in `script -qc "…" /dev/null` (the house pattern; plain `ssh` stays binary-safe).
- **The powerOff ssh session hangs** without keepalives: the link drops while the
  session is open and TCP waits minutes. The driver uses `ServerAliveInterval=3`
  so it errors out in ~6 s after the call has already fired; the poll loop is the
  real confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `TV did not answer within 180s` | TV may be hard-off at the mains or on a different network segment. Check it's plugged in; retry once (`WAKE_TIMEOUT=300`). |
| `Permission denied (publickey,password)` | You're on a machine whose key isn't on the TV. Add your pubkey to `/home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` from a trusted machine (or rely on the `sshpass` fallback in `tools/tv-ssh`). |
| `no MAC for the magic packet` | First run against a sleeping TV with no cache. Wake it by hand once and run `wake-tv.sh status` to learn+cache the MAC, or set `TV_MAC=` explicitly once. |
| Wake works but `make deploy` still fails | The deploy raced the wake-up services; retry the deploy, then md5-compare (see Gotchas). |
| `make deploy` says the app directory does not exist | Not a wake problem at all. That flavour has never been installed and scp cannot create an app — `make FLAVOR=<f> install` once (`tv-session` skill). |
