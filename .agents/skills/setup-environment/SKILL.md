# Set up the webOS build environment

This app is cross-compiled from macOS to a 32-bit ARM webOS TV. "Setting up the
environment" means getting three things in place so `make` works:

1. **The webOS NDK** — a buildroot cross-toolchain (GCC 12, glibc 2.12, armv7-a
   soft-float) plus a **sysroot** containing the TV's own SONAME'd libraries. The
   Makefile compiles and links against this.
2. **Rust nightly + `rust-src`** — the UI/logic is a Rust static lib built with
   `-Z build-std`, which recompiles `std` with our codegen flags (needed to avoid
   a SIGILL on the TV — see "Why build-std" below). That requires the nightly
   toolchain and the `rust-src` component.
3. **Host CLI tools** — `curl`, `tar`, CMake (the pinned Sentry Native build), and `sshpass`
   (deploy/run over ssh, only when the TV refuses your key).

The end state you're verifying: `make` produces `pkg/plxnative`, and it runs on the
TV with no missing-symbol or illegal-instruction errors.

## Fast path

From the repo root:

```bash
make setup-env        # download + extract + relocate the NDK into ~/webos-ndk
```

Then make sure the Rust side is ready (safe to re-run — no-ops if already done):

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup component add clippy   --toolchain nightly   # `make check` runs `make lint` first
brew install cmake        # builds the pinned, statically linked Sentry Native capture backend
brew install sshpass      # deploy/run fallback when the TV refuses your ssh key; skip if you won't touch the TV
```

Now build:

```bash
make                  # -> pkg/plxnative
```

### With a TV but no Plex account or token

The build needs no private data, and neither does driving the TV: the app can run against the
synthetic `tests/mock_pms.py`, which accepts any non-empty token.

```bash
echo '<tv-host>' > .tv-host      # the TV's address, one line (gitignored)
echo '<tv-mac>'  > .tv-mac       # optional: only Wake-on-LAN needs it (cached from ARP once the TV is up)
printf '#define PMS_HOST  "<this-mac-lan-ip>"\n#define PMS_PORT  32499\n' > src/config.local.h   # gitignored; no PMS_TOKEN
make                             # PMS_HOST/PMS_PORT are compiled in; nothing else is read from config.local.h
python3 tests/mock_pms.py --host <this-mac-lan-ip> --port 32499   # same address as PMS_HOST; the default binds loopback only
tools/tv-session.sh up --guest --mock --screen home       # debug flavor only; deploys and md5-verifies the binary, boots the synthetic identity
```

All three gitignored files are per-checkout, so a fresh worktree has none of them. `up` deploys
the built binary itself; `make FLAVOR=debug install` is needed only on a TV that has never had
the debug build. `--mock` makes `--guest` use `tools/mock-guest.py`, which refuses any server that
is not the synthetic mock, instead of resolving a managed user through plex.tv. Take the TV lock
first (`tv-lock` skill).

The default mock answers 3 Home hubs; `mock_pms.py --home-hubs N` serves N, counting Continue
Watching (so N-1 shelves plus Continue Watching), for work on Home with many rows. To measure
Home, add `--arm framedrop=25` to `up`: the event log then gets `FRAMEDROP` detail lines for
frames over 25 ms.

Without a TV, `make check` and `make sim` need no account either. `./tests/run.py --server` and
`--fps` call `read_token()` (a `PMS_TOKEN` in `src/config.local.h`) and read
`tests/manifest.local.json`, so they cannot target the mock today.

That's the whole setup. The sections below explain what each piece is, how to
verify it, and how to fix it when it goes wrong — read them when the fast path
doesn't Just Work.

## What `make setup-env` does (and how to do it by hand)

The `setup-env` target downloads the webosbrew **native-toolchain** buildroot SDK
for your Mac's arch (`darwin-arm64` on Apple Silicon, `darwin-x86_64` on Intel),
extracts it to `$(WEBOS_SDK)`, and runs its `relocate-sdk.sh`. The relocate step
is **required**: the SDK bakes absolute paths at build time, and `relocate-sdk.sh`
rewrites them to wherever you extracted it. If you ever move the SDK directory,
re-run `relocate-sdk.sh` or nothing will compile.

Manual equivalent (useful if the download URL changed — check the
[latest release](https://github.com/webosbrew/native-toolchain/releases)):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/webos-ndk && cd ~/webos-ndk
curl -fL -o sdk.tar.bz2 \
  https://github.com/webosbrew/native-toolchain/releases/download/webos-d7ed7ee.6/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot_darwin-arm64.tar.bz2
tar xjf sdk.tar.bz2
cd arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot && ./relocate-sdk.sh
```

Override the install location for the whole build with `make WEBOS_SDK=/path/... `.

## How the build is wired (the important mental model)

The Makefile links **against real sysroot libraries** for almost everything,
because their SONAMEs already match what the TV loads at runtime:

- `libSDL2 / libSDL2_ttf / libGLESv2 / libwayland-client / libglib-2.0 /
  libluna-service2` — standard libs, present in the sysroot.
- `libAcbAPI / libplayerAPIs / libpf-1.0` — **LG-proprietary**, but the webosbrew
  NDK bundles them, so we link the real thing and get link-time symbol checking on
  the Starfish/ACB C++ calls (no more hand-maintained mangled-symbol stubs).

Only **two families are still link-time stubs** (`stub/*.c` → `stub/*.so`), because
the sysroot can't satisfy them:

- **FFmpeg** (`libavformat/avcodec/avutil.so.57/.55`) — not in the sysroot at all.
- **libcurl** — the sysroot ships `libcurl.so.4`, but the **TV wants `.so.5`**.

A stub is a `.c` file of empty symbol bodies compiled `-shared -nostdlib -fPIC`
with `-Wl,-soname,<the TV's exact SONAME>`. It satisfies the linker on the host;
at runtime the TV's real library (matching that SONAME via `DT_NEEDED`) is loaded
instead. So **adding a call to a new FFmpeg/curl function means adding its name to
the matching `stub/*_stub.c`** or the link fails — only the name must match, an
empty `void foo(void){}` body is fine (it never runs on the host).

Sentry Native is a different case: `ci/build-sentry-native.sh` downloads a checksum-pinned source
archive, applies the tracked webOS/glibc-2.12/ARM32 patch, and cross-builds `libsentry.a`,
`libunwind.a` and the separate `sentry-crash` daemon with CMake. The libraries are statically
linked and the daemon is packaged beside the app; this adds no Sentry shared-library SONAME to the
television. Its HTTP transport is compiled out.

If you add a dependency on a *new* library that the TV has and the **sysroot also
has**, prefer linking it real (add `-l<name>` to `LIBS_REAL`) over writing a stub —
that's the whole point of the NDK. Only reach for a stub when the sysroot lacks it
or ships a different SONAME than the TV.

### Why `build-std` (don't remove it)

Rust's default `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi` codegen is ARMv6 and emits the legacy
CP15 memory barrier (`mcr p15, ..., c7, c10, 5`), which is **UNDEFINED on the TV's
Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) → SIGILL** the moment std touches an atomic. `-C
target-cpu=cortex-a9` fixes our crates, but the *precompiled* `std` still carries
the bad barrier — so we rebuild std from source (`-Z build-std`, hence nightly +
`rust-src`) with the same flags. `-C target-feature=-neon` dodges crates whose NEON
paths use unstable intrinsics. These live in `RUSTFLAGS_TV` in the Makefile; leave
them.

## Verify the setup

```bash
# 1. Toolchain present and is the right target
"$HOME/webos-ndk/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot/bin/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi-gcc" -dumpmachine
#   -> arm-webos-linux-gnueabi

# 2. Full build
make            # -> pkg/plxnative, no errors

# 3. Inspect the binary (readelf is in the NDK bin/ dir)
RE="$HOME/webos-ndk/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot/bin/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi-readelf"
"$RE" -A pkg/plxnative | grep Tag_CPU_arch       # -> v7  (NOT v6 — v6 SIGILLs)
"$RE" --version-info pkg/plxnative | grep -oE 'GLIBC_[0-9.]+' | sort -uV | tail -1   # -> GLIBC_2.12
"$RE" -d pkg/plxnative | grep NEEDED             # SONAMEs should match the TV's libs
```

The decisive check is on the TV itself: `make test` (deploy + run) and read the
event log it prints. A healthy boot shows the GL context, `ff: avformat=...`, `acb
create=1`, and rising FPS with no `SIGILL` / `undefined symbol`. See the main
`docs/agent-reference.md` "Testing / verification" section for the full event-log surface.

**On a television that has never had this checkout's developer build, that first `make
test` stops before it deploys**, saying the app directory does not exist. That is
correct and it is not a toolchain fault: `make deploy` scp's into an app directory that
is already registered, while creating an app is appinstalld's job — SAM has to learn the
id and the per-id LS2 role file has to be written. Three builds live on one TV now
(`com.sostk.nativejelly`, what users install, `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`, the Makefile's
**default**, and `com.sostk.nativejelly.nightly`, the nightly build), so install this one once
and everything after it is a plain `make test`:

```bash
make FLAVOR=debug install    # builds its .ipk, installs it, then deploys into it
```

The event log then lands under that install's own runtime root, not `/tmp` — ask for
the path with `make -s print-eventlog FLAVOR=debug` rather than typing one. The
`tv-session` skill owns the rest of the on-device loop.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `arm-webos-linux-gnueabi-gcc: command not found` / `No such file ...sysroot...` | NDK not installed or moved. Run `make setup-env`; if you moved it, re-run `relocate-sdk.sh`. |
| Paths inside the SDK point at `/Users/runner/...` | You skipped/failed `relocate-sdk.sh`. Re-run it from the SDK root. |
| `cannot find -lSDL2 / -lplayerAPIs / -lpf-1.0` | Wrong/incomplete sysroot (partial download, or `WEBOS_SDK` points somewhere stale). Re-extract; verify `find $SYSROOT -name 'libplayerAPIs.so*'`. |
| `error: "-Z build-std" ... rust-src` or `cargo +nightly` fails | Missing nightly or rust-src: `rustup toolchain install nightly && rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly`. |
| `make check` dies at `make lint` with `no such command: clippy` | The nightly was installed with `--profile minimal`, which omits clippy (the default profile ships it): `rustup component add clippy --toolchain nightly`. `make check` runs `lint` first; the cross-build itself never needs clippy. |
| `build-sentry-native: cmake is required` | Install the host build generator with `brew install cmake`. It runs the webOS cross-compiler; it does not compile target code with the Mac toolchain. |
| Binary is `Tag_CPU_arch: v6`, or SIGILLs on the TV at first atomic | `RUSTFLAGS_TV` got dropped, or std wasn't rebuilt. Ensure `-C target-cpu=cortex-a9` and `-Z build-std` are intact; `rm` the stale `libplxnative_modules.a` and rebuild. |
| `relocation R_ARM_MOVW_ABS_NC ... recompile with -fPIC` when building a stub | A stub needs PIC. Stubs already use `-fPIC` in `STUBFLAGS`; if you added a bespoke stub rule, add `-fPIC`. |
| Deploy/run steps fail with `the TV refused this machine's ssh key and sshpass is not installed` | Authorize your key on the TV, or `brew install sshpass`. `the TV is unreachable` means it is off or asleep (wake-tv skill; `make TV=<ip> ...`). |

## Portability note

The whole reason for this setup (vs. an ad-hoc `zig cc` + hand-stubbed libs) is
that the NDK targets **glibc 2.12 / armv7-a soft-float**, the webOS baseline — so
one binary is far more portable across webOS versions and TV models than a build
pinned to one firmware's glibc and one SoC. Keep new code within that baseline:
don't reintroduce a newer-glibc or SoC-specific toolchain pin without a reason.
Runtime-level couplings to this specific TV (LG's SDL 2.0.4 fork key offsets, the
reverse-engineered Starfish/ACB object offsets) still exist in the Rust/C code and
are *not* solved by the NDK — they're a separate, larger effort.
