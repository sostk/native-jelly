 * crashtrace.c — the fatal-signal tracer's I/O half: the descriptors, `write(2)`, the chunked read
 * of `/proc/self/maps`, and the handler itself. `src/crashfmt.h` holds the pure half (formatting
 * and the maps-line decision), which `ci/crashfmt-test.c` grades on its own.
 *
 * # Why this is a separate translation unit
 *
 * So that the SIGNAL PATH can be tested too. It lifted out of `main.c` on 2026-08-29 for exactly
 * one reason: `ci/crashtrace-test.c` links THIS FILE and nothing else, installs the handler onto a
 * temporary file, faults a child process on purpose and then asserts both halves of the contract —
 * that a record was written, and that the child still died of the original signal, which is what
 * the re-raise buys — a real `WIFSIGNALED` status for SAM, and NOT a crashd backtrace; see the note
 * on the re-raise itself, which measured that. Neither half is decidable from `main.c`, which drags
 * in the whole app.
 *
 * What that host test cannot see is stated where it lives, but the short version belongs here too:
 * on a Mac there is no `/proc/self/maps`, so `scan_maps` returns immediately and the `at:`/`bin:`
 * lines this file exists to produce are never exercised. Their DECISION is graded by the pure test,
 * their PLUMBING only on a television.

 * The tracer proper.
 *
 * It logs the faulting PC/LR, the registers around them, and the /proc/self/maps line(s) that
 * contain them, so triage can say WHICH module faulted (ours, LG's closed libraries, our
 * `dlopen`'d FFmpeg/curl/ACB) before anything is symbolized. `tools/crash-report.sh` and the
 * `crash-triage` skill read exactly what is written below.
 *
 * # It must be async-signal-safe, and until 2026-08-29 it was NOT
 *
 * The previous version called `fprintf`, `fopen`, `fgets`, `sscanf`, `strstr`, `fclose` and
 * `fflush`. None of those is on POSIX's async-signal-safe list, and the reason is exactly the
 * situation this handler runs in: stdio takes a per-stream lock and allocates, so a fault that
 * happened *inside* `malloc` or while another thread held that lock can deadlock or fault again
 * here — losing the report, in the crash class most worth having one for. It "worked" every time
 * it was used because the crashes it was used on were ordinary bad pointers.
 *
 * So everything below is `open`/`read`/`write`/`close` and hand-rolled formatting, all of which
 * ARE on the list. The output is still ASCII and still the same shape: it is read by a shell
 * script, by that skill and by a human, and a binary record would be no safer to write and worse
 * to read. Two static buffers are used and reused — they are BSS, so they cost nothing at boot and
 * cannot fail to be there when the handler needs them, which is the property that matters.
 *
 * # What it does NOT try to do
 *
 * There is no backtrace. `backtrace()` is not async-signal-safe, ARM unwinding out of a signal
 * handler commonly stops at `gsignal()`, and deferring it does not help because by then the stack
 * is gone. Two frames plus the registers plus the faulting module is a FAULT EVENT, not a
 * backtrace, and the honest name is used in the docs for the same reason it is used here.
 *
 * No load-bias arithmetic either: `pkg/nativejelly` is `ET_EXEC` (`readelf -h`, `Type: EXEC`), so
 * the PC already IS the link-time address and `crash-report.sh` subtracts the mapping base only
 * to sanity-check that the address falls inside our own text. `dl_iterate_phdr` would answer a
 * question this binary does not ask.

     * choice: the partition is 615.6 MB shared with every app the user has installed and had
     * 125.9 MB free when this was measured, against a ~200 MB core.
     *
     * (Not proven all the way: writing a core to confirm the chain would have needed ~200 MB that
     * was not there, so the core→report link is inference from `core_pattern` rather than a
     * measurement. What IS measured is that we get no report.)

     * SAM's status. With consent and a configured endpoint, Sentry Native may additionally preserve
     * a bounded multi-thread report for every successfully captured thread. That is an argument
     * for the tracer being good, not for turning cores back on.
     *
     * # THE UNBLOCK IS THE WHOLE THING, and without it none of the paragraph above was true
     *
     * `sigaction` without `SA_NODEFER` adds the delivered signal to the thread's mask for the
     * duration of the handler. So `raise(sig)` merely marks it PENDING, returns 0, and control
     * falls through to the `_exit` below — which is a CLEAN EXIT with status `128+sig`. No core, no
     * crashd report, and `WIFEXITED` rather than `WIFSIGNALED` for the parent.
     *
     * That is what this code did from the day the re-raise was written (2026-07-09) until
     * 2026-08-29, with the line below commented "only reached if raise() somehow returns" — it was
     * reached EVERY time. The commit that added it was fixing exactly this failure in its earlier
     * form (a bare `_exit(3)` that "hid every crash from the system tracer") and it swapped one
     * clean exit for another, more plausible-looking one. Nothing could have noticed: the tracer's
     * own log looks identical either way, and `128+11 = 139` is a perfectly ordinary-looking
     * status. It was found by `ci/crashtrace-test.c` faulting a process ON PURPOSE and asking the
     * one question no log can answer — *how did it die?*

     * `sigprocmask`, `sigemptyset` and `sigaddset` are all on POSIX's async-signal-safe list.
