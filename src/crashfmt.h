 * crashfmt.h — the PURE half of the crash tracer: formatting a fault record and deciding what a
 * /proc/self/maps line means. Everything here is a total function over its arguments, touches no
 * global and makes no syscall, which is what lets `ci/test_crashfmt.py` compile and RUN it on the
 * development Mac. `src/main.c` holds the other half — the descriptors, `write(2)`, the chunked
 * read of the maps file and the handler itself.
 *
 * # Why the split exists
 *
 * The tracer runs in signal context on a television, so it can be graded there and nowhere else,
 * and there is no way to make a host test fault an ARM process. But the part of it that has
 * actually been WRONG is not the syscalls — it is the parsing, and the failure mode is a
 * `bin:` line naming the wrong mapping, from which `tools/crash-report.sh` computes an offset and
 * answers with a confident wrong function. That is worse than no answer, it is silent, and it is
 * decidable from a string with no television in the room. Its twin is recorded in that script: the
 * app id `com.sostk.nativejelly` is a PREFIX of `com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`, so triaging the stable
 * install would accept the debug install's load base.
 *
 * **A correction, because this file inherited an invented justification and it is exactly the kind
 * that makes a reader distrust the rest.** `src/main.c` carried, for as long as the tracer existed:
 *
 *     the app dir is itself named ...com.sostk.nativejelly/, so a bare substring test also matches
 *     libraries deployed beside the binary (libturbojpeg.so.0)
 *
 * It does not. The needle is `/plxnative`, with the slash, and the directory component is
 * `/com.sostk.nativejelly` — slash, then `c`. Measured rather than reasoned: a bare
 * `strstr(line, "/plxnative")` answers no on `…/com.sostk.nativejelly/libturbojpeg.so.0` and yes on
 * `…/com.sostk.nativejelly/plxnative`, which is the right answer for the wrong reason. What the
 * separator test actually buys is the two cases below, and the test file asserts those and not the
 * one that was written down.
 *
 * # Everything here must stay async-signal-safe
 *
 * That is a constraint on the CALLER's behalf: these are `static inline`, they are called from a
 * signal handler, and so no function added here may allocate, take a lock, or call anything from
 * stdio. The formatter writes into a caller-owned buffer and stops at its capacity — a truncated
 * record is worth having and an overrun is not, and in signal context there is nothing to report a
 * failure to.
