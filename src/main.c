 *
 * The answer comes from Rust (`plx_runtime_path`, rust-modules/base/src/paths.rs) rather than from a
 * literal here, and that is the whole point: this file opens three logs before a single line of
 * Rust runs, and `crate::log` and the panic hook then append to two of them. Two definitions of
 * "where" — one in C, one in Rust — is the split-brain paths.rs documents at length: main.c would
 * truncate a log at /tmp while Rust wrote to another, and the crash report built afterwards would
 * be missing whichever half you did not look at. One resolver, asked twice, cannot disagree.
 *
 * Safe to call this early: the resolver touches nothing but its own lazily-initialised path and
 * must not log (it would re-enter that initialisation). If it ever fails — a path longer than the
 * buffer — the literal below keeps the behaviour every release so far has had, which is the right
 * fallback because the app users get is exactly the one whose root IS `/tmp`.
 *
 * Two static buffers are alternated per call. No current call site holds two results at once, so
 * this is cheap insurance for a future one rather than a live hazard. */
