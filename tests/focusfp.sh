# tests/focusfp.sh — the FOCUS FINGERPRINT flows, on the simulator, against the synthetic PMS.
#
# Each flow boots `nativejelly-sim` into an instance root with `nativejelly-focus` armed, drives it
# through the remote FIFO with the same tokens a television session uses, and keeps every
# `focus …` fingerprint line (`crate::focusprobe`, logged only on CHANGE) plus every `route=`
# heartbeat transition the run produced. The result is one `.fp` file per flow under $OUT: the
# (screen x key) characterisation of the app's focus behaviour, taken against data that is pinned
# (`tests/mock_pms.py --seed`) and free of household bytes, so it can be diffed across commits and
# committed as a fixture.
#
# Phase 0 of the UI restructure runs this as a LIVE-SIM SMOKE: a flow passes when the app stayed
# alive and produced at least MIN_LINES fingerprint lines. From phase 2 the flows are replayed
# from the committed recording instead (restructure spec §15.4). --targets (also --replay) feeds
# recorded resolution; --resolve grades the real engine/map before recorded continuation.
#
# Flow 10 (root BACK at Home / picker / QR) is a television flow — on the simulator a root BACK is
# a log line and nothing else — and is listed here as SKIP so the numbering matches the spec.
#
