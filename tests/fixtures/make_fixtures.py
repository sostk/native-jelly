"""Synthesize the media SHAPES `tests/manifest.json` needs, out of nothing but ffmpeg.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `tests/run.py` grades the player against nine symbolic *item shapes*
(`movie_h264_ac3_1080p`, `episode_hevc_4k_hdr10_eac3`, …) and `tests/manifest.local.json`
maps each to a ratingKey on whatever PMS the contributor owns. That mapping is the whole
barrier to entry: the shapes include a TrueHD default with an AC-3 sibling, a Dolby Vision
profile 8.1 base layer, a PGS bitmap subtitle track and an eight-track audio file with
English TrueHD at ordinal 6. Nobody has all of that lying around, and two of them (TrueHD,
Dolby Vision) have no freely-licensed example anywhere in the world. So a contributor
either owns an exotic library or cannot run the suite at all. This script removes that:
it builds every shape from lavfi sources, lays them out in two Plex-scannable trees, and
writes `fixtures.json` describing exactly what it proved about each file.

WHAT A GREEN RUN ON THIS MEDIA DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. These files are synthetic. They
exercise the same code paths — route decision, demux, Starfish payload, ACB bind, timeline
— but a real remux carries encoder quirks, odd GOP structures, container edge cases and
metadata this generator will never produce. Read a pass here as "no regression against the
shapes the suite names", never as "plays the world's media". `tests/README.md` makes the
same distinction about `--fps` numbers; it applies with more force here.

TWO TIERS, ONE GENERATOR (`--tier`). Everything above and below describes the INTEGRATION
pack: the two Plex-scannable trees `tests/manifest.local.json` maps shape keys into.
`--tier pipeline` builds a second, much smaller pack for the player-PIPELINE tier, which
has no Plex in it at all — flat 60 s clips served off the dev Mac by
`tests/serve_fixtures.py` and played through `/tmp/nativejelly-playurl`, which carries the
URL *and* the Load payload declaration. Both packs share every builder, every trap below
and `verify()`; what differs is the table (`PIPE_SHAPES`), the on-disk layout, and the fact
that nothing in that table is derived from Plex's watched threshold, its marker detector or
a case's seek depth — because none of those exist down there. `PIPE_SHAPES`' own comment is
where that tier's shapes, and the three it deliberately cannot contain, are argued.

ONE STANDALONE SET (`--only mockverify`) is intentionally outside both manifest packs. It makes
two small 150-second MKVs and an SRT for `tests/mock_pms.py --media`, so a television can verify
language preferences and client-rendered subtitles without a Plex server or account. The mock
ffprobes those files itself; this generator still verifies their exact stream layouts at creation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TRAPS THIS SCRIPT IS BUILT AROUND. Every one of them fails SILENTLY — the command
succeeds, the file exists, and it is the wrong shape. That is the failure mode worth
fearing here, because a wrong fixture makes the harness fail as if the PLAYER regressed.
Which is also why `verify()` is not optional: every property a shape CLAIMS is read back
out of the finished file with ffprobe, and a mismatch is a hard error naming both sides.

 1. `-t <n>` IS AN INPUT OPTION and must precede its own `-i`. Written after `-i` it binds
    to the NEXT input; written last it becomes an output option. On an unbounded lavfi
    source that means ffmpeg encodes FOREVER at 100% CPU. Every lavfi input below gets its
    own `-t` in front of it, audio graphs additionally carry `duration=` inside the filter,
    and the muxes that mix bounded and unbounded inputs (the PGS one — a `.sup` is not a
    timed input) also carry a trailing output `-t`. Measured: a 20 s video muxed with a
    60 s `.sup` produced a 58-second file.

 2. THE AUTO-INSERTED SCALER OVERWRITES color_primaries/color_trc when it converts lavfi's
    rgb24 to yuv420p10le. `-color_primaries bt2020 -color_trc smpte2084` alone yields
    `bt2020nc/unknown/unknown` and Plex will not label the file HDR. The colour stamp must
    ride `setparams` AFTER an explicit `format=` in the same filter chain, which is why
    every video chain here ends `…,format=<pixfmt>,setparams=…`.

 3. THE MATROSKA MUXER IS NOT THE ONE EATING THE COLOUR STAMP — trap 2 is. This entry
    used to read "ffmpeg's mkv muxer drops the transfer characteristic for HLG:
    `smpte2084` survives, `arib-std-b67` does not", and the conclusion drawn from it was
    that HLG must be muxed with `mkvmerge`. RE-MEASURED on the same ffmpeg 8.1.2, using
    the chain shape below: HLG SURVIVES the mkv mux — `mkvinfo` shows the container's
    `Colour transfer: 18` and ffprobe reads back `arib-std-b67`. What actually loses the
    transfer is `-color_trc` written as an OUTPUT option with no `setparams`, and that
    form loses `color_primaries` too, which is the tell: a muxer that special-cased one
    transfer value would not also drop the primaries. So nothing here needs mkvmerge for
    a colour reason, and whoever builds the `library_gaps` HLG clip needs `setparams`,
    not mkvtoolnix. The Dolby Vision shape goes through `mkvmerge` for an unrelated
    reason: ffmpeg's matroska muxer will not write the DV configuration record from a raw
    `.hevc`, and that record is precisely what the app reads back
    (`ff: … dovi=P8 bl_compat=1`).

 4. PMS EXCLUDES FILES WITH "sample" IN THE NAME under 300 MB. Nothing here is ever named
    sample*; the two raw ES intermediates are `_bl.hevc` / `_bl_rpu.hevc` inside `.work/`,
    which is deleted, and outside the library trees regardless.

 5. `testsrc` (v1) IS A NEAR-STATIC PATTERN: ~181 kbit/s at 1080p CRF18. `testsrc2` at
    identical settings is ~7,830 kbit/s — and real Creative-Commons footage measured 7,560,
    i.e. 3% BELOW testsrc2. So testsrc2 is the base here, everywhere. Bitrate is not
    cosmetic: `seek_rapid_h264` and `seek_rapid_hevc_4k` assert `coalesced=n>=1`, which
    needs a seek still resolving ~50 ms after it was issued. Against a 181 kbit/s source
    every seek in the burst completes before the next tap and nothing ever coalesces — the
    case passes its other assertions and covers the merge path zero times. So the two
    shapes carrying a rapid-seek case declare a `min_mbit` FLOOR, and `verify()` asserts
    it out of the finished file. It is a floor and not a comment because a CRF is not a
    bitrate: this file once carried a comment claiming those two shapes "get the higher
    bitrates", while the H.264 seek shape sat at exactly the same CRF as the two shapes
    with no seek case at all.

 6. `-preset ultrafast` SILENTLY FORCES H.264 CONSTRAINED BASELINE. The H.264 shapes use
    `veryfast` with an explicit `-profile:v high`. (x265 has no such coupling, so the HEVC
    shapes do use `ultrafast` — it is the difference between an 18-minute run and an hour.)

 7. lavfi SOURCES ARE rgb24. Without an explicit `format=yuv420p` libx264 picks yuv444p and
    reports "High 4:4:4 Predictive", which is not what a library file looks like and is not
    what the TV decodes.

 8. THE lavfi DEMUXER REJECTS NAMED OUTPUT PADS. A graph handed to `-f lavfi -i` must end
    on an UNLABELLED pad (or `[out0]`); a trailing `[a]` fails with "Invalid outpad name".
    The per-channel audio graphs below therefore end bare on the `join`.

 9. PLEX MARKS AN ITEM WATCHED PAST ~90% AND DROPS THE viewOffset THE HARNESS JUST SEEDED.
    `subtitle_text_srt` seeds 843 s, so its item must run past 843/0.9 = 937 s or the case
    silently becomes a play-from-zero test. Every duration below is the deepest seek /
    resume / marker depth its cases reach, divided by 0.9, then rounded up with margin.
    And nothing is ever shorter than 60 s even where the cases would allow 30: an item that
    hits EOF inside its `run_secs` fires the finish → Up Next → auto-advance chain, which
    contaminates `no_playing_error` and the teardown assertions of a case that was only
    ever about playing.
    ONE EXCEPTION, and it is the exception that proves the rule: `pipe_h264_ac3_short` is
    20 s BECAUSE ending is what it grades (LG item #46 — `tests/run.py::a_finished` for the
    completion, `a_replayed` for the restart after it). It is the only shape in either table
    allowed to be short, and the cases allowed to name it are exactly those declaring
    `reaches_eos` — two today, `pipe_finish_eos` and `pipe_replay_after_eos`. The harness
    enforces the OPPOSITE bound for them: `_resolve_fixtures` SKIPS such a case whose fixture
    is longer than 0.6 × the case's cap PER VIEWING (a replaying case needs the clip twice).
    Adding a second short clip means picking a side; whichever side the harness was not told
    about, it will skip rather than fail.

10. ffmpeg HAS A PGS DECODER AND NO PGS ENCODER, and refuses text→bitmap conversion
    outright ("Subtitle encoding currently only possible from text to text or bitmap to
    bitmap"). So this file contains a small HDMV PGS writer (`pgs_build`, below) that
    authors the `.sup` directly. It is NOT a conformant Blu-ray authoring tool — single
    window, single object, one palette, epoch-start per cue — but ffmpeg's own PGS decoder
    reads it back as `num_rects=1` per cue and 0 per clear, which is exactly the display-set
    stream `subtitle_image_pgs` grades. No external tool (SUPer, avs2bdnxml, BDSup2Sub) is
    needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO IDEAS BORROWED FROM iwalton3/stdjflib, both about making a WRONG FILE VISIBLE.

 * THE STREAM LAYOUT IS BURNED INTO THE PICTURE. `testsrc2` already draws a running
    timecode and frame counter top-left (verified — that is a property of the source, not
    of `drawtext`, which this Homebrew ffmpeg does not even have: it is built without
    libfreetype, so there is no `drawtext` and no `subtitles` filter). What testsrc2 cannot
    say is which shape you are looking at, so `banner_png()` rasterises the shape key and
    its full stream layout with a built-in 5x7 font into an RGBA PNG and `overlay` composites
    it TOP-centre. A media-source mix-up in the harness then shows up in a screen capture
    without anyone consulting a manifest. The banner text is generated FROM THE SAME
    declarative spec that `verify()` asserts, so the two cannot drift.
    TOP-centre, and not the bottom-centre it sat at until a verifier photographed the
    result: at the bottom the plate lands in the band the app draws SUBTITLES in and the
    band the PGS cues are authored in, so on the two shapes whose whole case is "is a
    subtitle on the screen" the two texts overprinted each other. The top-LEFT corner is
    testsrc2's own timecode box (measured: about 160x48 px at 1080p), so the plate starts
    at H/12, below it.

 * EVERY AUDIO CHANNEL GETS ITS OWN PITCH. A 5.1 track is six sine sources joined with
    `join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=…`, at musically distinct frequencies (LFE two
    octaves down), so a bad downmix or a swapped channel map is AUDIBLE rather than merely
    plausible. `map=` IS LOAD-BEARING and was missing: with no map, `join` does NOT consume
    its inputs in declaration order — each mono sine's own layout is `FC`, so input 0 claims
    the CENTRE channel and the rest fill in around it. Measured on the shipped file: the
    intended FL/FR/FC/LFE/BL/BR pitches came out rotated as FC/FL/FR/LFE/BL/BR. That still
    sounds like six distinct pitches, so nothing looks wrong — it just makes the file
    useless as the channel-ORDER reference it is documented to be, and `verify()` asserts
    channel COUNT, which cannot see it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORDERING IS PART OF THE SPEC — the cases assert track POSITIONS, not just presence.
`tests/README.md`: audio-tab row = the metadata audio index in file order; subtitle-tab
row 0 is *Off* and row r is subtitle index r-1. So:

 * `audio_switch_transcode` picks audio row 6 on `movie_h264_ac3_many_audio` and expects a
   transcode, so index 6 is the ENGLISH TrueHD track (TrueHD is outside the direct-play set).
 * `audio_switch_native` picks audio row 1 on `episode_hevc_4k_hdr10_eac3` and expects a
   NATIVE switch, and its title says "foreign default + eng … file default picked at start".
   So index 0 is a German E-AC-3 track carrying the default disposition and index 1 is the
   English one: with no Plex language preference the route auto-picks the file's default
   (German, row 0) at start (#210), and row 1 switches to the English track — both being
   E-AC-3 keeps the switch native.
 * `subtitle_text_srt` picks subtitle row 3 = index 2 and expects English cues, so the four
   text tracks are ordered [rus forced, rus, eng, eng-SDH] — the same order as the real
   library item the case was written against.
 * `subtitle_image_pgs` picks subtitle row 1 = index 0, so the PGS track is index 0.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE, stated here rather than discovered later: intro/credits MARKERS.
Plex's detector needs Plex Pass, ignores intros under 20 s, and will not detect an intro
that ends past the halfway point. The episode pair does carry an identical 130 s intro
segment over a 300 s episode (on by default; `--no-markers` turns it off), plus a 40 s
black credits tail, placed to satisfy both constraints — but whether Plex's analyser fires
on synthetic content is not something this script can assert, and the three `marker_*`
cases stay a real-library concern. See README.md.

WHICH MODALITY THE INTRO HAS TO BE IDENTICAL IN, because the first version of this got it
exactly backwards and shipped: Plex fingerprints AUDIO and looks for the stretch that
MATCHES between episodes of a season. The original pair differed only by a `hue` filter,
i.e. in video, and its audio was one constant unmodulated tone from end to end — so the
whole 300 s matched, the candidate ran past the halfway point, and there was nothing for a
detector to bound. Meanwhile the intro WINDOW was the one stretch that differed, because
the burned-in layout banner reads `S01E01` vs `S01E02` inside it. Both halves are now the
other way round: the audio is a shared 3-tone intro melody and then a per-episode pitch
after `intro_end` (and a distinct low bed under the credits tail), and the layout banner is
only drawn AFTER `intro_end`, so the intro window really is frame-identical. `verify_pair`
asserts all three out of the finished files rather than trusting the filter graph.

#
# `duration` is the deepest depth the shape's cases reach (setup.viewOffset_ms, seek
# target_s/final_s, resume offset_s, skip min_pos_after_s + min_climb_after_s, expect.
# min_timeline_climb_s), divided by 0.9 for Plex's watched threshold (trap 9), rounded up
# with margin, and floored at 1.5x the longest `run_secs` of any case that names the shape
# — never at 60 flat, which is what four shapes carried while their cases capped at exactly
# `run_secs: 60`. Zero margin is invisible on the PASSING path (the harness ends a case the
# moment its assertions are satisfied) and stacks a spurious finish -> Up Next -> teardown
# failure on top of a real one whenever a case FAILS or runs under `--no-early`, which is
# the hardest kind of harness output to read. `rate` is encode-seconds per second of
# output measured on an Apple-silicon Mac with this Homebrew ffmpeg — it exists only to
# print an honest ETA, and it is the number to re-measure if the ETA drifts.
#
# `crf` is chosen per shape against the size budget: the whole set is ~2.5 GB. The two
# shapes carrying a rapid-seek case (movie_h264_ac3_1080p, episode_hevc_4k_hdr10_eac3)
# additionally declare `min_mbit`, a measured floor verify() reads back out of the finished
# file — because seek COALESCING is what those cases grade and a thin stream never
# coalesces (trap 5). This comment used to claim those two "get the higher bitrates" while
# the H.264 one sat at the same CRF as the two shapes with no seek case at all; a CRF is
# not a bitrate, which is why the floor is asserted now instead of narrated.

# THE PIPELINE TIER — a second, much smaller table, for a suite tier with NO PLEX IN IT.
#
# `tests/serve_fixtures.py` serves a directory of these clips off the dev Mac, and
# `/tmp/nativejelly-playurl` hands the app one URL plus the Load payload DECLARATION to play
# it with (`player::playurl::PlayUrl` -> `route::set_stream_declaration`). Everything from the socket
# down is then the same code a real playback runs — `stream.rs`' GET, `ff.rs`' AVIO and
# demux, the `aq.rs` queues, the pump's `Feed()`, the ACB bind — with the server, the
# `/decision`, the PlayQueue, the timeline and the watched state all absent. So this tier
# grades the pipeline and the payload the engine builds for it, and nothing above them.
#
# WHY A SECOND TABLE AND NOT MORE ROWS IN `SHAPES`. Every constant up there is derived from
# something that does not exist down here. A duration is the deepest seek/resume/marker
# depth a Plex CASE reaches divided by Plex's 90% watched threshold (trap 9); nothing here
# seeds a viewOffset, marks anything watched, or has an Up Next to fire, so the length
# constraints left are TWO, in opposite directions: "do not hit EOF while a case is still
# asserting" for fourteen of the fifteen clips, and "DO end, inside the cap" for
# `pipe_h264_ac3_short`, which exists to run out. The harness enforces both and skips rather
# than fails on either side. The LAYOUT differs
# for the same kind of reason: the Plex trees exist for a SCANNER, and the thing reading
# these is a static file server (see `out_paths`).
#
# WHAT THIS TIER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONTAIN, written down so nobody adds it back as an
# oversight — each of the three looks like an obvious gap and is not:
#   * TrueHD / Atmos. The correct LG Load-payload audio string for TrueHD does not exist
#     anywhere in this repo, so the shape could not be DECLARED — and the declaration is
#     this tier's entire subject. A `declare` that is a guess grades a guess.

    # THE RESOLUTION x CODEC MATRIX — LG App Self Checklist #50 / #51.
    #
    # That item is graded as a MATRIX, and until 2026-08-23 this repo could only answer it as
    # "pieces are covered": the pack was 1080p everywhere plus one 4K HEVC, so SD and HD had
    # never been played at all and 4K H.264 existed in neither pack (`library_gaps` lists it —
    # every 4K item in the maintainer's library is HEVC or AV1, which is a fact about one
    # library, not about the app). Six shapes below complete it:
    #
    #                 h264 / AC-3 5.1 mkv          hevc / E-AC-3 5.1 mkv
    #     SD   720x480    pipe_h264_ac3_480p           pipe_hevc_eac3_480p
    #     HD  1280x720    pipe_h264_ac3_720p           pipe_hevc_eac3_720p
    #     FHD 1920x1080   pipe_h264_ac3_1080p (above)  pipe_hevc_eac3_1080p
    #     UHD 3840x2160   pipe_h264_ac3_2160p          pipe_hevc_eac3_4k_hdr10 (above)
    #
    # FOUR decisions in it, each of which looks arbitrary and is not:
    #
    #  * ONE AUDIO CODEC PER COLUMN, held constant down the column, so a row-to-row difference
    #    is the resolution and nothing else — and each column's constant is the one the rung
    #    ALREADY in the table above uses, so the existing two cells belong to the matrix rather
    #    than being neighbours of it. E-AC-3 in the HEVC column is also the better false-PASS
    #    defence: `engine`'s `_ =>` arm produces `"AC3"`, so every HEVC row here expects an
    #    `"AC3 PLUS"` no unread declaration can produce.
    #  * SQUARE PIXELS AT 720x480, so the picture is 3:2 rather than the 4:3 a DVD would
    #    display. An anamorphic fixture would be testing PAR handling — a different axis, with
    #    no assertion behind it anywhere in this repo — and `testsrc2` has no PAR to speak of.
    #  * CRF IS NOT THE AXIS and is not held constant. A constant CRF is constant QUALITY, not
    #    constant bitrate, and 4K H.264 at the 1080p rung's crf 20 measures ~30 Mbit/s, i.e. a
    #    quarter-gigabyte clip in service of no assertion; crf 26 lands at ~11.8 Mbit/s, which
    #    is inside the band real 4K H.264 ships in. Nothing here declares `min_mbit`: that floor
    #    exists for the rapid-seek cases (trap 5) and no case in this matrix seeks.
    #  * SDR 8-BIT THROUGHOUT, which makes the UHD/HEVC cell the odd one — it is the existing
    #    HDR10 Main10 fixture. Deliberate: HDR is a third axis, that cell is the one already
    #    device-verified (2026-08-22), and an SDR 4K HEVC twin would differ from it only in
    #    `trc=`/`pri=`, which nothing in this matrix grades. Say it out loud rather than let a
    #    reader infer a uniform column that is not there.
    #
    # The television's own capability table (`/etc/umediaserver/device_codec_capability_config
    # .json`, which `devcaps.rs` reads) claims H.264 to 4096x2304 and HEVC to 4096x2176, so
    # every rung here is INSIDE the hardware envelope. The 4096-wide edge, and any refusal
    # above it, stay uncovered — a fixture wider than the panel would be grading a refusal path
    # nobody has specified.

    **This is the fix for the corpus having ten data points.** `serve_fixtures.py` advertises 90
    segments per rung but resolved every `sequence=N` to ONE file, so 593 logged segments in the
    P1 device run carried exactly ten distinct byte sizes -- each of them a file size on disk.
    `bytes` was not merely collinear with `rung`, it was an exact function of it, and no amount of
    playback could add a degree of freedom. See `docs/measurements/p1-transaction-anatomy.md` §6.

    The split is a STREAM COPY of the clip this function was just handed, so the encode is
    untouched and each segment is exactly what the encoder produced for those two seconds. `-g 48`
    with `-sc_threshold 0` puts an IDR on every 2 s boundary at 24 fps, which is what makes the
    cut land cleanly; `-reset_timestamps` gives each segment a zero base, matching the measured
    PMS contract and the existing one-file pack.

    Segment 0 KEEPS THE ORIGINAL NAME. That is deliberate and is what makes this backward
    compatible: an old pack, `ABR_FALLBACK`, `fixtures.json` and `verify()` all still find the
    file they expect, and a server that has not learned about the extra segments still serves a
    correct -- if repetitive -- stream.

    Measured on the current recipe: six real cuts of a 12 s 1080p clip span 2 403 956 to
    2 757 772 bytes, a 1.15x spread. Quality-targeted encodes give LESS spread, not more (CRF
    1.07x, VBR-with-headroom 1.09x), because the source complexity is near-constant and those
    modes smooth what little there is -- so the existing rate-targeted recipe is kept.
