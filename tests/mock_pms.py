"""A SYNTHETIC Plex Media Server — enough of the PMS REST surface for the app to boot to Home,
browse a library, open a detail page, a season, a person, search, mark watched, and start a play,
with NOT ONE household byte anywhere in it.

Why it exists (restructure spec §5.6): every committed replay fixture and every focus-fingerprint
flow is recorded against THIS server, on the simulator, so the recording can be committed to a
public repository without a scrub pass that cannot recognise a title. Every string a real PMS
would fill with a title, a name, a summary or a tag is drawn here from one CLOSED ALPHABET —
`s` + eight lowercase hex digits (`s3fa90c12`) — plus the protocol's own constants (`movie`,
`h264`, `home.continue`, …). `tests/test_harness.py` verifies committed fixtures against exactly
that alphabet, which is decidable; "does this look like a title" is not.

What it is NOT: a PMS emulator. It answers the endpoints `plex/{library,hubs,transcoder,
timeline}.rs` request (`docs/plex-openapi.json` is the spec they follow) with the FIELDS
`plex/models.rs` deserialises, and nothing else. An unknown path gets an empty container and a
line on stderr naming it, so extending it is one function. Numbers go on the wire as numbers;
the models fold either form.

Deterministic: the library is generated from `--seed` and never from the clock, so two servers
started with one seed answer byte-identically, which is what a fixture recorded against one and
replayed against the other needs.

`--media DIR` adds two fixed verification items backed only by the synthetic files made by
`tests/fixtures/make_fixtures.py --only mockverify`. Their stream records are derived from those
files with ffprobe at startup, never from a household library or account. Without `--media`, the
library and the old deliberately undecodable part response are unchanged.

`--extra-media FILE` (repeatable) adds one movie per arbitrary file outside that fixture set —
e.g. a hand-generated Dolby Vision asset — with its DOVI*/colorTrc/bitDepth/container fields read
from ffprobe exactly like `--media`, at a fixed ratingKey block (990001+) that cannot collide with
the generated library or the `--media` verification ids. The ratingKey-to-file mapping is printed
at startup.

    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --port 32499              # serve until Ctrl-C
    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --port 32499 --selftest   # prove the shapes without an app
    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --port 32499 --movies 321 --rail-fixture  # multi-page A–Z rail
    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --host 0.0.0.0 --media /path/to/mockverify  # account-free TV set

`--catalog tests/demo_library/catalog.json` is the one exception to the closed alphabet, and a
deliberate one: the DEMO LIBRARY behind the documentation screenshots (`make screenshots`). It
serves real titles, credits and synopses of openly licensed and public-domain films, with the
artwork `tools/demo_library.py derive` built from the pinned sources in
`tests/demo_library/assets.json`. Its clock is pinned (`now` in the catalog), so it is as
deterministic as a seeded library; `--hero SLUG` moves one film to the front of Continue Watching,
which is the home hero's first slot. An episode marked `stand_in` plays: its media is a black,
silent file of the episode's catalog length that `derive` made (never the work itself), which is
enough for the simulator's clock sink to run the player over it. And a `continuous=1` PlayQueue
of an episode carries the rest of its show after it, as PMS's does, so Up Next has a successor.
Nothing recorded against it may be committed as a fixture — the harness's alphabet check would
refuse it, correctly.

Every mode also answers the four plex.tv calls of the QR sign-in (`/api/v2/pins`, the poll, the
QR image, and `/api/v2/user`) with a fixed demo code, for an app booted with
`nativejelly-plextv=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`: the sign-in screen can then be driven and captured
without touching plex.tv. The poll stays pending unless `--authorize-after N` (implied, N=2, by
`--plaintext-only-lan`) links the code on the Nth poll with a synthetic account token, so a
sign-in completes end to end without any real account.
`GET`/`PUT /api/v2/user/profile` also reads and edits an in-memory synthetic profile;
`/api/v2/user` returns the same preferences for playback warmup. Changes last only until the
mock stops, and PUTs are recorded in the mock write log. Ordinary mode advertises itself through
`/api/v2/resources` and supplies one synthetic Demo owner in the Home roster, so mock QR sign-in
can reach Settings without a pre-seeded session.

The app reaches it as any other server: `make sim-shot SIM_PMS=127.0.0.1 SIM_PORT=32499` with
any non-empty string in `$SIM_DIR/nativejelly-token` (the token is accepted, never checked).

`--plaintext-only-lan` reproduces Sentry PLX-NATIVE-10: a person's OWN server (`owned=true`) on
their LAN, whose owner never turned on port forwarding, so every HTTPS route plex.tv could name
for it — a `*.plex.direct` connection AND relay — fails, while the plaintext local address still
answers. It makes `/api/v2/resources` return exactly ONE resource, no relay connection at all,
and two connections: an `https://<dashed-ip>.<hash>.plex.direct:<port>` one with `local=true` that
FAILS (a real TCP listener that accepts and immediately closes, i.e. a genuine TLS handshake
failure — or, with `--insecure-fail-mode unreachable`, a port nothing listens on at all), and a
plain `http://<advertise-ip>:<port>` one with `local=true` that is THIS SAME server, answering
`/identity` tokenless. `--advertise-ip` sets the LAN address the resources row carries (default:
this host's detected primary LAN IPv4, else `127.0.0.1` with a startup warning — 127.0.0.1 is
loopback, which the app's own eligibility check classifies as NOT a LAN address, so the consent
path this mode exists to exercise will never trigger with that fallback; pass a real address).
Bind with `--host 0.0.0.0` so a device other than this one can actually reach it. Expected app
behaviour: a "Connect without encryption?" consent offer, never a dead end.

The full reproduction needs a developer build to take the STORE credential policy — every
`devtriggers` build otherwise lets a token ride plaintext and never needs the consent — and a QR
sign-in against this mock (it authorizes the code by itself, on the 2nd poll):

    1. python3 tests/mock_pms.py --host 0.0.0.0 --plaintext-only-lan --advertise-ip <HOST-LAN-IP>
       (the LAN plaintext leg the app connects to directly).
    2. `plex_tv()` in rust-modules/src/plex/account.rs accepts only a `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`
       trigger — the trigger carries the account token, and that restriction is deliberate and
       must stay. So make plex.tv loopback ON THE DEVICE with a reverse tunnel from the host
       (hold the TV lock first):
         ssh -N -R 32499:127.0.0.1:32499 root@<TV-HOST>
    3. in the install's runtime root, arm (empty files unless shown):
         nativejelly-storepolicy                       store HttpsOnly policy (dev builds only)
         nativejelly-login                             boot to the QR sign-in
         nativejelly-plextv = http://127.0.0.1:32499
    4. launch. The events log shows, in order:
         - the sign-in read-out "Couldn't sign in" with the reason "Your Plex server is on this
           network but can't be reached securely. Select Connect to connect without encryption."
           and the primary *Connect*
         - *Connect* opens "Connect without encryption?" seated on *Not now*; its *Connect* logs
           `plaintext: user allowed an unencrypted connection on this network` and retries
         - the retry mints the grant (`security: consented plaintext credentials for one server at …`),
           then `security: plaintext PMS credentials sent under a consented grant` — the token
           rides http://<HOST-LAN-IP>:32499 under it — Home loads from this mock
         - Settings → Unencrypted connections shows the server ON; turning it off logs
           `settings: unencrypted connections turned off for one server` and withdraws the grant
           at once
Loopback (the simulator) is never LAN-eligible, so steps 3–4 on the Mac stop at the ineligible
read-out; the consent flow itself needs the TV and a real LAN address.

    # TV (replace 192.168.0.10 with the host's actual LAN IPv4; never a real private address from
    # a gitignored file — hold the TV lock for the device commands below):
    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --host 0.0.0.0 --plaintext-only-lan --advertise-ip 192.168.0.10
    # `nativejelly-plextv` only ever accepts a loopback address (see step 2 above), so make plex.tv
    # loopback ON THE DEVICE with a reverse tunnel from the host, then arm the loopback trigger:
    # ssh -N -R 32499:127.0.0.1:32499 root@<TV-HOST>
    # nativejelly-plextv=http://127.0.0.1:32499

    # Simulator (loopback is both plex.tv and the LAN address it advertises; still exercises the
    # HTTPS-fails / plaintext-answers shape, just not the loopback-ineligibility warning):
    python3 tests/mock_pms.py --plaintext-only-lan --advertise-ip 127.0.0.1
    # nativejelly-plextv=http://127.0.0.1:32499

Issue #266 (Boost Dialog / Normalize Loudness) fixtures and flags, every one default-off except
the loudness attribute itself:

`--no-plex-pass` answers `/` and `/identity` with `myPlexSubscription=false` (the version string
is untouched — `tools/mock-guest.py` keys off it). Every generated and verification audio stream
otherwise carries `canNormalizeLoudness="1"` (PMS string-encodes booleans on the wire); pass
`--no-loudness-analysis` to omit the key entirely, modelling a server that never ran loudness
analysis on the source.

`/video/:/transcode/universal/decision` answers a live `boostDialog=1` or `normalizeLoudness=1`
like measured PMS 1.43.4 with Plex Pass (M1/M2 in the design plan): the Part's decision becomes
"transcode", the video stream stays "copy", and the audio stream becomes "transcode" with
`codec=ac3` at the SAME channel count as the source — whether the request shape was a remux
(`directPlay=0&directStream=1`) or an MDE probe (`directPlay=1&directStreamAudio=1`); a param of
`0` or absent is byte-identical to today. `--refuse-enhancements` answers instead with the
server-refusal shape (`generalDecisionCode=2000`, a `transcodeDecisionCode`/`transcodeDecisionText`
naming the enhancement, `route/plan.rs::refusal` reads this). `--ignore-enhancements` accepts the
params but leaves the audio decision "copy" (an old server that does not act on them). Both can
also be flipped live, mid-run, with `POST /_mock/config` — JSON body
`{"refuse_enhancements": true, "ignore_enhancements": false, "plex_pass": false}` — so one test
case can resolve once, then refuse only from the next decision on.

Five fixed fixture movies (own section id 3, so ordinary section/rail counts and hashes over
sections 1/2 are untouched, but each is reachable directly at its ratingKey) exercise the offering
and fallback rules:
  - 960001 `ac3_2ch_capable` — AC3 2.0.
  - 960002 `aac51_capable` — AAC 5.1.
  - 960003 `dv_p8` — Dolby Vision profile 8 (`DOVIPresent`/`DOVIProfile` etc. on the video stream).
  - 960004 `default_embedded_srt` — a default embedded SRT subtitle.
  - 960005 `server_selected_external_srt` — an external SRT stream, `selected=true`, `key` set,
    `codec="srt"`.

`GET /_mock/requests` returns every request `handle()` routed — `{"method", "path", "query",
"session"}`, with any query key containing "token" stripped — as a JSON array, in arrival order;
`DELETE /_mock/requests` clears it. (Raw ranged media-byte GETs under `/library/parts/<id>`
bypass `handle()`, as before, and stay on the older `pms.requests` list only.)

`--transcode-fixture PATH` serves that file, with the same Range/206 handling as `--media`'s part
bytes, for every `/video/:/transcode/universal/start...` request in place of the 404 a session
with no server-side transcoder otherwise returns. It is for exercising the TV's playback pipeline
against a real container; it claims no DSP realism for the enhancement itself.

        after the direct title hits, in library order. The order and the choice of which relations
        a real server applies are assumptions: the spec names these two examples and says the hubs
        are ordered "based on quality", which the mock does not try to model. Shows, episodes and
        the other hubs hold direct hits only.
