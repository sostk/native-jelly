"""
A Range-capable static file server, for the player-PIPELINE test tier.

Why this file exists at all, when Python ships `http.server`: **`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` does not
implement `Range`, and the failure is silent and total.** The app's demuxer seeks by closing the
socket and re-opening with `Range: bytes=<target>-` (`ff.rs::seek_cb`), and `stream.rs` accepts any
2xx — so a server that ignores the header answers `200` with the file *from byte zero*, the AVIO
layer believes it is positioned at `target`, and every subsequent byte is offset garbage. There is
no error anywhere: the demuxer reports a corrupt bitstream, or hangs looking for a start code, and
the case reads as a player bug. That is the single most important thing this file does, and it is
why `Range` is not optional here (§4 of the spec below).

THE SPEC — what the app actually requires of a server (all read out of the code, not assumed):

  1. Request line is `GET <abs-path> HTTP/1.1` with `Host:`, `User-Agent: nativejelly/0.1` and
     `Accept: */*` (`stream.rs::http_open`). Media GETs omit `Connection: close` so HTTP/1.1
     keep-alive is the default; sequential HLS/playlist GETs to the same peer reuse the fd.
     Range seeks still close from the client (`ff.rs::seek_cb`). No pipelining.
  2. Only the status code, `Content-Length:` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` are parsed
     (`stream.rs`, the block after the header read). Everything else we send is ignored, so extra
     headers are free but never load-bearing.
  3. Any 2xx is success (`status < 200 || status >= 300` is the rejection). `206` is therefore
     accepted, and is what a Range response must be.
  4. `Range: bytes=<n>-` MUST be honoured with `206` + a body starting at byte n. Open-ended only:
     the demuxer never sends an end offset. See the note above for what ignoring it does.
  5. `Content-Length` MUST be the length of THIS response's body (`size - n` on a 206), not the
     file size. `stream.rs` counts `consumed` per connection and stops at `content_length`; the
     total file size is captured once, at the FIRST open, into `AvioState.size` (`ff.rs:1845`) and
     is what `AVSEEK_SIZE` answers. Sending the full size on a 206 makes the reader wait for bytes
     that never come — a 15 s `SO_RCVTIMEO` stall per seek.
  6. First byte promptly: `SO_RCVTIMEO` is 15 s and the header read is a single blocking `recv`.
  7. `HEAD` is answered because it is free and makes the server debuggable by hand; the app never
     sends one.

Run it directly to serve a directory, or import `serve()` from the harness — `tests/run.py` starts
one per pipeline-tier run and stops it in teardown.

    ./tests/serve_fixtures.py --root tests/fixtures/out --port 8020

macOS trap, and it costs an afternoon every time: the **application firewall silently drops the
TV's connections to an ad-hoc python listener** — no refusal, no log line, the TV's open just reads
empty. The same shape bit `tools/netcond.py` (verified 2026-08-11). The GUI prompt "allow incoming
connections?" must be accepted once per python binary, so start this ONCE with a human at the
keyboard before going headless, and read "the server logged nothing" as the firewall rather than as
a quiet television. `--selftest` fetches from itself over the LAN address and says which it is.

# 404'd, so `admits` deleted Uhd on every `auto_network` case, so the two entries the production
# table calls empirical were the two no case could reach — a fixture gap standing in for a policy.
# It is answered now, by a real 4K clip. A 1080p-source case still never requests it (the catalog
# deletes it), so nothing about the existing cases changes; a case that declares
# `source_raster: [3840, 2160]` can reach it.

# What a rung asks PMS for is a BITRATE CEILING and the raster is the consequence; the controller's
# acceptance test is `hls_raster_within` — the decoded picture must FIT the rung's raster, not equal
# it — so several rungs legitimately share a raster.
#
# They must NOT share a FILE, and that is a change from this pack's first shape. Every rung from
# 6000 up used to serve one `pipe_abr_1080p.ts`, which is sufficient for grading which rung a
# controller chose and useless for measuring what that rung COSTS: the reachable buffer ceiling is
# `queue_bytes / media_rate` (`docs/adaptive-playback-plan.md` §0.1), so a pack that delivers the
# same bytes for 6 Mbit/s and 18 Mbit/s reports the same reserve at both and measurement step M4
# has nothing to read. The mid/high rungs now serve rate-targeted clips of their own
# (`make_fixtures.py`'s `vbr` key), one per rung.
#
# WHAT IS SYNTHETIC HERE, precisely: the MEDIA is real — really encoded at that bitrate, really
# demuxed, really fed through the same path as any other segment. What is synthetic is that a
# rung's clip is generated rather than produced by a PMS transcoder, so it carries no JIT
# production latency; `network_profile` shapes the transport and nothing here models an encoder
# falling behind. Production cadence is measurement step M3's job, against a real PMS.

        # Why a second shaper, when `set_network_profile` already shapes the link

        `network_profile` is keyed to the wall clock, and there is one behaviour it structurally
        cannot produce: a rate that falls DURING a transfer whose target was chosen from the rate
        before it. That is not a corner case — it is the only condition under which a candidate
        transfer deadline can fire at all, and the reason is worth stating because it is not
        obvious. The controller picks its downshift target from the rate it just measured, so on a
        steady link the target is by construction affordable: a rung is admitted only if its
        `expected_wire_kbps` fits the measured budget, and one segment of it therefore fetches in
        about one segment of time. A transfer only becomes unaffordable when the rate underneath
        it drops after the choice was made.

        With a wall-clock cliff, whether that happens is a PHASE relationship — the cliff has to
        land near the end of a segment fetch, so that the measurement stays high and the next fetch
        runs slow. `pipe_abr_down_collapse` produced exactly that once in three runs of the same
        case (36 156 ms of fetch against a 5 793 ms reserve), and the two runs that did not bracket
        the change it was supposed to grade. A test that enters its own state one time in three
        cannot grade anything.

        Keyed to the segment COUNT instead, the same event is exact: the controller measures
        segment `from_segment - 1` at the fast rate, decides, and its candidate warm-up IS segment
        `from_segment`, served slow. No clock, no phase, no luck.

        **Counted per media-segment RESPONSE, not per `?sequence=`**, because sequence numbering
        restarts at zero for each rung — so a candidate's warm-up is always `sequence=0` and could
        never be selected by sequence. Playlists do not count; they carry no media.

        Legs apply from `from_segment` onward, last match wins, and an empty list restores the
        ordinary behaviour. It COMPOSES with `network_profile`: this one wins where it applies,
        which is what lets a case shape the run-up on the clock and the critical fetch by index.

        justify because there is no constant.

        Interleaving is at CHUNK granularity, which is what a real link does with two flows
