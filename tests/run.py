"""
On-device regression harness for the webOS Plex player (plex-native-poc).

The matrix is split in two: manifest.json holds the installation-independent case definitions,
and the gitignored manifest.local.json (see manifest.local.json.example) maps each case's
symbolic `item` key to a ratingKey on this server and supplies the PMS host, TV address and
test user. load_manifest merges them and fails with the missing key if the overlay is absent.

The matrix is a SUPERSET of what any one library can exercise, so an `item` key the overlay
cannot resolve -- absent, or left as the example's `<ratingKey>` placeholder -- SKIPS the cases
and fps scenes that need it and runs the rest, printing what it gave up. Only the values no run
of any size can proceed without (pms.host, tv, test_user.id, a malformed shared_server) are still
fatal. Before 2026-08-22 a single unmappable shape killed all 21 cases, which meant the suite ran
for exactly one library in the world -- see tests/README.md, "Running it against your own library".

For each case in manifest.json this driver:
  1. closes the running app on the TV (luna-send closeByAppId + fuser -k, via `make kill`);
  2. establishes the item's resume point server-side -- AFTER the close, so a live
     timeline_thread can't re-scrobble over it. ALWAYS clears it first (/:/unscrobble), then
     seeds `setup.viewOffset_ms` if the case declares one. The offset lives on the SERVER and
     outlives the run, and the app reports progress every 10s while playing, so an unreset case
     inherits whatever the last case -- or the last RUN -- left on that rk, and `resume_ns`
     resumes anything past 10s. One item is shared by five cases and another by three, so
     leaving it implicit turned "play from the start" into "resume from somewhere", varying with
     suite order and run history. Do not make the reset conditional again;
  3. clears every plxnative-* trigger in THIS install's runtime root, then writes only the
     ones this case needs;
  4. runs `make run-stream TV=<tv> FLAVOR=<f>`, which relaunches the app and tails its event
     log live;
  5. filters the `smp_cb type=43 num=0 str=` flood and evaluates the per-op assertions
     CONTINUOUSLY as lines arrive, stopping the case the moment it passes — the manifest's
     run_secs is the cap, not the runtime (see stream_case for why that is sound, and
     --no-early to turn it off);
  6. records PASS/FAIL with the failing evidence line.

Two builds can sit on one television -- com.sostk.nativejelly, the app users install, and
com.sostk.nativejelly.debug beside it -- each with its own app directory, its own SAM id and its own
runtime root (/tmp for stable, /tmp/<app id> for a flavoured install). Every run here drives
exactly ONE of them: the flavour comes from --flavor, else the overlay's `flavour` key, else the
Makefile's own default, and every path that follows is ASKED FOR rather than restated
(`make -s print-rundir` / `print-eventlog`). See resolve_flavour.

Security: the PMS X-Plex-Token is read from src/config.local.h at runtime and is NEVER
printed, logged, or written to any file. The TV ssh creds already live in the committed
tools/tv-ssh (the published dev-mode password), so we shell out to `make` /
tools/tv-ssh for device I/O. A run that also needs a SECOND server (a friend's shared one)
resolves that server's own access token from plex.tv with the same owner token -- again
storing nothing; see resolve_shared_server.

Usage:
  ./tests/run.py --list                 # list cases and what they cover
  ./tests/run.py --build                # cargo + make + make deploy, then run all cases
  ./tests/run.py --filter marker        # run only cases whose name contains "marker"
  ./tests/run.py --flavor stable        # drive the OTHER install (see check_install first)
  ./tests/run.py                        # run every case (assumes app already deployed)

Exit code is nonzero if any selected case fails.

No third-party deps -- Python 3 stdlib only (macOS system python3 is fine).

    Early exit is sound only because assertions are monotone once satisfied: more time cannot
    un-satisfy them. Two kinds of bound break that and must run the full cap.

    `gst_trace`: GST_DEBUG_FILE is not tailed by run-stream, so those assertions can only be
    graded after the run; an event-log-only partial grade must not end the case first.

    `abr_shape`: its `max_commits` bound COUNTS EVENTS over whatever window it was given, so
    stopping early does not merely observe less -- it scores lower, in the passing direction. The
    same binary scored 7 rung changes on a full window while PASSING a 5-bound on an early-exit
    run of the same case (I1, 2026-08-26), then 8 on a later full window. A bound whose value
    depends on when grading stopped cannot be graded early in either direction.

    `link_profile`: a case that conditions the link has LEGS, and the interesting one is never
    the first. Stopping as soon as the opening assertions hold ends the case before the squeeze
    it exists for — observed on the first run of `auto_link_squeeze`, which passed in 70 s of a
    150 s profile whose second leg starts at 50 s.

    `delay_ms` on an operation: the operation HAS NOT HAPPENED YET, and its assertion can be
    satisfied by evidence something else produced. Measured on `auto_pin_then_original_and_seek`,
    whose seek is scheduled at 95 s: the case exited early at 71 s reporting `[PASS] seek_transcode`,
    because `op_seek_transcode` matches `reload_transcode: fresh Load at offset` and a QUALITY
    SWITCH emits that same line -- so the switch's reload graded as a seek that had not fired. Run
    to its full window the seek fires and the case passes on the right evidence. Note this is NOT a
    monotonicity failure: the assertion is monotone, it is merely satisfiable by a look-alike. That
    is why the rule keys on the SCHEDULE rather than on the operation kind -- an undelayed seek
    fires promptly and stays eligible.

    `min_play_rate_pm`: the same shape from the other side. It grades the WORST window of the
    media clock, so it is satisfied by every prefix that has not met the slow leg yet, and a case
    that stopped early would report the rate of its healthy opening. Both tiers ask it now, which
    is why `run_case` calls this function too -- it did not until 2026-08-27, and the server cases
    are exactly where a slow film was reported.

    reads as healthy. `abr_stalls` grades the clock STOPPING and `playback_rate` grades it
    advancing too SLOWLY; this grades it advancing in the right amount at the wrong granularity —
    `2,0,2,0,2,0` instead of `1,1,1,1,1,1`. The mean rate over that is exactly 1000 pm, no beat
    is a stall longer than one, and the picture is visibly juddering.

    Device-measured (`pipe_abr_down_outrun`, 2026-08-28): after three downshift attempts drained
    the reserve to 168 ms, the media clock ran `123 125 125 127 129 129 131 133 133 …` for ~30
    beats. `abr_stalls` scored max=8 total=13 — all of it the earlier true stall — and
    `playback_rate` scored ~1000 pm. Both were right and both were blind: playback was running
    straight off the network one 2 s segment at a time, because the queue was empty and each
    arrival advanced the clock by a whole segment.

    A beat is LUMPY when the clock moved by 2 s or more in one 1 Hz beat — i.e. it delivered at
    least a whole extra segment's worth in the time one second of media should have taken. That
    threshold is not a tuning knob: 2 is the smallest integer step this ±1 s source can
    distinguish from real time at all (a true 1 s advance may read 0 or 1, never 2).

    A seek moves the clock discontinuously and is not lumpiness; `playback_rate`'s leg splitting
    is the wrong tool here because a lump IS a forward step, so this instead ignores any step
    larger than `LUMP_SEEK_S`, above which a jump is a relocation rather than a delivery.

    Returns `(mean_pm, worst_pm, beats, legs)` in per mille of real time, or `(None, None, n, 0)`
    when there is not enough of a series to say. 1000 is real time; 670 is the picture crawling.

    **This is the only thing here that can see a slow film.** Every other metric on this line is a
    RESERVE, and a reserve is media time measured against the playhead — so when the playhead
    itself slows down, the reserve stops draining, `slope` goes quiet, and `min_buf_ms` reads
    healthy while the picture runs at two thirds speed. `max_stall_s` cannot see it either: a
    stall is the clock not advancing at all, and this is the clock advancing too slowly.
    Measured on the corpus 2026-08-27: `pipe_abr_band_20000` holds 670 for ~30 s with `buf`
    parked at 2.2 s, `slope` decaying to −29 ms/s and every buffer signal reading fine.

    The wall clock is the HEARTBEAT COUNT: `app.rs`'s `loop_tick` emits one line per wall second
    whatever the frame rate, so beats are seconds. Arrival stamps are used instead when `lines`
    carries them (a live `StampedLines`), because they measure wall time directly and survive a
    beat the ssh hop dropped; a log read back off disk has none and falls back to the count.

    RESOLUTION: `pos=` is INTEGER seconds (`RE_POS`), so a single beat is ±1 s and only a window
    is meaningful. Over `window` beats the quantization is ±1000/(window−1) pm — ±111 pm at the
    default 10 — which is why nothing shorter is reported and why a bound below ~900 is the only
    kind this can carry honestly.

    A seek or a reload moves the media clock discontinuously and is NOT a rate. Legs are split on
    any backward step, and on a forward step larger than the wall gap plus one second of slack;
    each leg is measured on its own and legs shorter than `window` are dropped.

    cannot tell those apart.

    **Counts the DECODED raster when the log carries one** (`out=`, appended 2026-08-28), and the
    catalog raster otherwise. That is not a formatting preference — the two disagree, measured:
    against a 4K source PMS produces 1280x720 for BOTH `P720` and `P1080M6`, and against a 1080p
    source it produces 1918x802 for every rung from `P1080M6` up
    (`docs/measurements/m3-production-census.md`). So on the catalog reading a `P720 -> P1080M6`
    commit is a raster change and a viewer sees nothing, while `P1080High -> Uhd` on a 1080p item
    reads as a change into 4K that never happened. A rung's raster is a BOUNDING BOX, not a
    target, and this counter is the plan's device co-grader — it was grading the intent.

    A log with no `out=` falls back to the box and is scored exactly as before, so the two are not
    mixed within one series: whichever the FIRST commit offers is used for all of them.

    **It returns WHICH reading it used, and the caller prints it.** Two series answer to one name
    here, and this file states the doctrine twice elsewhere — a scene "must never grade a loop rate
    as if it were a frame rate", a renamed field "must fail as 'no samples' rather than silently
    match zero". A silent whole-series fallback is the same hazard: `0x0` is not hypothetical
    (`ff.rs` writes it whenever a candidate produced no output, which a stall-aborted one does), so
    a CURRENT build's log can revert to bounding-box semantics with nothing saying so — while the
    failure message's `trail` goes on showing catalog rasters either way.

def a_abr_shape(lines, spec, dip_windows=()):
    """Grade the RUNGS a shaped link produced, rather than only the Original<->HLS transition.

    `a_auto_network_recovery` above grades one event. This grades the whole trajectory, which is
    what a bad-network profile is actually testing, and it is the only assertion here that can fail
    on the controller being TOO EAGER: a link that carries 4 Mbit/s and a client that spends the
    whole film reaching for 20 both "play", and only a ceiling can tell them apart.

    Six independent bounds, each optional, each answering one question a profile poses:

    * ``ceiling_kbps`` -- no rung above this was ever active. The overreach guard.
    * ``floor_kbps`` -- some rung at or above this WAS active. The under-reach guard: a controller
      that parks on 320 Kbps forever also never stalls, and would pass every other assertion here.
    * ``max_commits`` -- at most this many committed rung changes. The FLAP guard, and the one that
      grades the decaying transition penalty: an oscillating link must not produce a commit per
      oscillation, because each one is a visible quality change to the person watching.
    * ``decoded_width_floor`` -- some completed candidate actually decoded at least this wide.
      This is deliberately separate from ``floor_kbps``: the latter is the request actuator, and
      PMS may answer a 22 Mbps / 4K request with a 720p rendition.
    * ``settle_min_kbps`` / ``settle_max_kbps`` -- where it ENDED. Bounds rather than a value,
      because the ladder has 13 points and a link between two of them may legitimately settle on
      either; a profile that wants an exact rung sets both to it.
    * ``min_rejected_upshifts`` -- at least this many upshifts were PROPOSED and then REFUSED
      (an ``abr: tx Up`` whose outcome is not ``committed``). The E_tx(up, reject) guard: it grades
      that the refusal path runs, without asserting a rung the admission law may legitimately
      admit on the same link.

    Read from ``abr: steady`` AND from the commits, in log order. Steady alone is not enough and
    steady alone is what this did, which made both bounds under-report.

    ``abr: steady`` is emitted only on ``Decision::Stay`` (``ff.rs``), so a rung the controller
    commits to and then immediately proposes to leave — or commits to near the end of a case —
    produces no steady line at all and was INVISIBLE here. Measured 2026-08-28:
    ``pipe_abr_seek_flat`` logged ``tx Up 2000->10000kbps outcome=committed`` and then ended
    (that transaction alone took 22.4 s, 20.6 s of it feed backpressure), so ``visited`` was
    ``{720, 2000}``, ``max`` was 2000, and ``floor_kbps: 8000`` failed a case that had reached
    10000.

    **The same gap is a FALSE PASS on the other side**, which is the half that matters more:
    ``ceiling_kbps`` is the overreach guard the manifest calls "the assertion no position climb can
    stand in for", and a rung reached and left inside one segment cleared it by not being looked at.

    Commits alone would not do either — the STARTING rung is not a commit, and a case whose whole
    point is "it never moved" would have nothing to read. So it is the union, ordered by position
    in the log, which is what "which rung was the controller on, over time" actually means.
    ``visited[-1]`` is then the last rung it was on, which is what ``settle`` wants.

        the payload rebuilt — the thing that distinguishes a real restart from a pipeline that
        never tore down.
      * the media position FELL and then climbed again. A replay that resumed where the first run
        ended would produce both lines above and no second viewing; the drop is the only evidence
        that the stream restarted rather than continued.

    The position series is the same `pos=` heartbeat every other case reads, deliberately: a binary

    LG App Self Checklist #46 is "replay after completion", and this is its first half — the
    completion. Two links, in order, because either alone is satisfiable by something that is not
    a finish:

      * `EOS reached: playpos=Ns/Ms → ended` (pump.rs) — the producer hit file EOF AND the pipeline
        played out to within a second of the duration. Not merely "the socket closed": the pump
        gates the flag on `eos_pushed && pos >= dur - 1s`, so a truncated transfer does not reach
        it.
      * `stop_bufferfeed: torn down` (engine.rs::teardown) AFTER that line — `app.rs` calls
        `finish_playback` on `player::ended()`, which with nothing queued is `exit_player`. The
        ORDER is the assertion: this app tears the engine down on every stop, including the
        harness's own close at the end of a case, so an unordered match would pass on a clip that
        never ended at all.

    "After" is a SEARCH FROM `eos`, not a comparison against the first teardown in the log, and
    the difference is a false regression rather than a nicety: `teardown` writes that same line on
    a `for_reload` stop too — a seek that escalated to `reload_at`, or an app-switch suspend — so a
    first-match index can sit BEFORE the EOS while every teardown that matters comes after it. The
    comparison form fails such a case for its whole `run_secs`, with the evidence reading "the
    player froze on the last frame", which is exactly the reading this assertion exists to avoid.

    What it deliberately does NOT claim is the SECOND half of #46 — that the same content can then
    be started again. That is [`a_replayed`]'s job and `pipe_replay_after_eos`'s, and the two stay
    apart because the failures are different: a stream that never ends, and a stream that ends and

    This is the thing a person does at the television that no boot override can reach:
    `plxnative-quality` decides what a playback STARTS as and is read once, while switching a
    running stream re-asks the routing question against a picture already on screen, reloads if the
    answer moved, and — on the way out of Auto — tears down a live ABR controller.

    Three assertions, and the middle one is the only one that grades what a PIN MEANS:

    * every requested rung produced its `quality: switch → <rung>` line, in order;
    * **Auto's controller stops when Auto stops**, and — only if this run showed it running at all
      — resumes when Auto does. `route::hls_abr_control` returns `None` for any non-Auto quality,
      so the `abr: sample` line, one per acquired segment, must cease after a pin. That is a
      derived consequence of the routing policy rather than a restatement of it: nothing tells the
      controller about the switch, it simply is not constructed. A pin that left it deciding would
      be a stream still being adapted under a user who asked for a fixed rung.

      The RESUME half is conditional, and self-calibrating rather than assumed. `hls_abr_control`
      also requires HLS delivery and a live encoder, so Auto on an item this server DIRECT-PLAYS
      runs no controller and never will — asserting one would fail on somebody's library for a
      reason that is not a defect. So it is asserted exactly when the run itself demonstrated the
      capability: if `abr: sample` appeared before the first switch, Auto adapts this item here,
      and switching back must restore that. If it never appeared, the case still grades the switch
      landing and playback surviving, and says so.
    * the position keeps climbing across the whole sequence, since a reload that never re-primes
      would otherwise read as a successful switch.

    `no_playing_error` is asserted separately by every case that uses this, so it is not repeated

    1. The ask reached the server and TOOK EFFECT: the app's own `enhancement: applied boost=..
       loudness=1` line, printed only on `EnhancementOutcome::Applied` (`route/decision.rs`'s
       `retranscode_as`), so a request the server merely accepted (or silently ignored) fails.
    2. The Load was declared with the audio the server actually negotiated: the `decision output:`
       audio codec at/before the applied line (`retranscode_as` logs its own codecs first) equals
       the post-toggle `load: .. a=".."` codec. Invariant I4: the payload follows /decision's
       OUTPUT, never the source or a literal — PMS 1.43.4 answers a DSP param over an AAC source
       with `a=aac`, over AC-3 with `ac3`.
    3. The route is a REMUX, not a re-encode: the video codec after the toggle (`ff: v=`, else the
       post-toggle `load: v=`) equals the codec before it (the last `ff: v=`/`load: v=` before the
       applied line — a direct-play start may be torn down before it ever logged `ff: v=`).
    4. The post-toggle stream is `start.mkv` (`TranscodeDelivery::ProgressiveMkv`), the one
       delivery PMS answers a DSP param with; an HLS re-encode under a fixed rung would be
       `start.m3u8`, a different, non-enhanced contract by design.
    5. No `ff: open_input failed` after the applied line. The demuxer the reload tears down logs
       `ff: aborted during open_input` instead (`ff::open_input_failure_note`), so this line is

    `subtitles=embedded`/`=sidecar`/`=auto` shapes M4 measured. Two manifest shapes reach this
    grader:

    * A COLD START (`{"op": "audio_enhancement_burn"}`, no live pick): the item already carries a
      server-selected embedded subtitle, so `route/plan.rs`'s cold-start branch computes
      `Offered(Burn)` before the first frame and logs exactly ONE `enhancement: applied` line
      (`route::decision::log_enhancement_outcome`, the same helper `retranscode_as` below calls —
      before that helper existed, the cold-start branch classified the outcome but never logged it,
      so this manifest shape had no line to grade at all).
    * A LIVE RECONCILE (`{"op": "subtitle", "burn": true}`): the boot-time preference decorates an
      otherwise-bare candidate as an ordinary enhanced remux first (one `enhancement: applied` line
      with no subtitle in the picture), then the pick reroutes it to a burn
      (`route::decision::reconcile_enhancement`), producing a SECOND `enhancement: applied` line.

    Both are graded the same way, off the LAST `enhancement: applied boost=.. loudness=..` line and
    the stream state after it:
    1. The (last) applied line shows `loudness=1` — the DSP survives whichever path got here; a
       route-flavour change (Remux -> Burn) must never silently drop the preference (I6/M7's whole
       point).
    2. The post-line stream path carries `subtitleStreamID=<id>` and `subtitles=burn` — the explicit
       M7 shape, not `=auto`/`=embedded`/`=sidecar`.
    3. The post-line stream is NOT `start.mkv` (`TranscodeDelivery::ProgressiveMkv`, the
       enhancement's ordinary remux) — a burn denies the remux flavour too
       (`enhancement_policy`'s `remux: !force_burn`), so it must show a re-encoded delivery instead.
    4. No client-side `sub cue [..] len=N` line for the picked track AFTER the burn lands — once
       PMS bakes the subtitle into the picture the client must not ALSO draw it, or the viewer would
       see it twice.

# Streaming run — grade the event log AS IT ARRIVES, stop as soon as a case passes.
#
# The old path slept a fixed run_secs (60/70/75/90 per case — 1190s, ~20 min of pure
# sleep across the 18 cases) and only graded afterwards. Almost every case satisfies its
# assertions well before that. What a case can NOT beat is `min_timeline_climb_s` seconds
# of real playback, because playback is 1x realtime — that is the floor, and it is a
# coverage decision, not waste. So run_secs stops being the runtime and becomes the CAP:
# a FAILING case still costs exactly what it costs today; a passing one costs what it needs.
#
# Why grading a prefix is sound: almost every assertion is monotone once satisfied — it looks
# for a line that has appeared, or for a max/climb that only grows. The exceptions are the two
# ABSENCE checks, which start out true and can only flip the other way:
#   * a_no_error            — `smp_cb type=18` / `Playing error`
#   * op_seek_rapid         — `reload_at: fresh Load` (stuck-watchdog gave up on in-place)
# ...and, since 2026-08-23, one COUNT that is an equality rather than a floor:
#   * a_replayed            — exactly N `replay:` lines (more than N is a loop)
# It is the same shape as the two above and it is here because this file asks a third exception to
# be reasoned about rather than added. What it cannot see: an app that replays FOREVER fires its
# next `replay:` line only after another full viewing (~20 s on the short clip), and the case can
# satisfy everything else at ~28 s, so an early exit two seconds later stops before the evidence
# arrives. The primary defence is therefore app-side and not here — `replay_left` is decremented
# before each re-arm and its parsing is host-tested (`app::replay_budget_tests`) — and `--no-early`
# is how to go looking for a loop deliberately. Deliberately NOT closed by forcing this one case to
# burn its whole 100 s cap: that is ~1.5 min on every suite run to guard three lines whose bound is
# already gradeable by `make check`, and the trade is worth re-taking only if that bound moves.
# So early exit can never turn a FAIL into a PASS on the evidence *seen*; what it can do is
# stop before evidence that would have failed the case arrives. SETTLE_S keeps watching for a
# moment after the last assertion flips, and --no-early restores the full fixed window.
# For the rapid-seek cases the structure already covers most of that risk: op_seek_rapid wants
# >=8s of position CLIMB after the last seek, so that much post-burst playback has to elapse
# before the case can pass at all — well past when the watchdog would have escalated.
# (Note the old window was itself arbitrary — an error at 70s of a 60s case was never caught.)

    * THE APP KEEPS RUNNING. Nothing closes it at the end — `make kill` only runs at the START
      of the next case, so the last case's playback just carries on. It keeps a PMS session
      open, and its timeline reporter keeps posting progress every 10s, so the next run
      inherits a resume point on that rk — the exact contamination ee07506 removed between
      cases, reintroduced at the seam between runs. It is also what "I see FPS tests running"
      looks like from the outside, long after the suite printed its summary.
    * THE INJECTED TOKENS STAY in the runtime root's plxnative-token and plxnative-servers: real
      per-(user,server) PMS access tokens -- and the second file carries someone ELSE'S server's
      too -- world-readable, on a device with a rooted sshd and a committed password. The normal
      path did clear them; every abnormal one left them. Both are covered because the wipe is a
      GLOB over <runtime root>/plxnative-*, which is exactly why a new credential trigger needs
      no change here; a credential file named anything else would need one.
    * ssh CLIENTS. Per-case reaping covers a case that ends normally, but not the harness dying
      between cases.

    All three are scoped to the install this run drove and to nothing else: `make kill` carries
    the flavour (so `closeByAppId` names this id, and `fuser -k` is INODE-scoped on this app dir —
    a name-based kill would take the other install down with it), and the trigger wipe is a glob
    inside this flavour's runtime root. A run against the developer build must leave the app users
    installed exactly as it found it, running or not.

    Never raises: a teardown that throws on an unreachable TV would mask the real failure (and
    on Ctrl-C would replace the user's interrupt with a traceback about ssh).

    IDEMPOTENT, because two things arm it — the atexit hook in `arm_teardown` and the `__main__`
    wrapper — and on the ordinary path both fire. Doing the work twice is only wasteful, but the
    second `make kill` prints over the summary the user is reading, and a reader who sees the
    cleanup banner twice reasonably wonders which run it belonged to.

# The PIPELINE tier — the player, with no Plex behind it at all.
#
# The 21 cases above drive `plxnative-play=<ratingKey>`, i.e. the whole chain: plex.tv auth, the
# PMS `/decision`, library metadata, the PlayQueue, markers, resume, the timeline reporter. That
# is the right shape for what they grade — SELECTION — and it is also why they need somebody's
# library and cannot run for anyone else.
#
# These cases drive `plxnative-playurl`: a generated file served off this machine by
# `tests/serve_fixtures.py`, plus the Load-payload declaration to play it with. What runs is the
# same engine, byte for byte, from `stream.rs`'s raw-socket GET through `ff.rs`'s demux over the
# custom AVIO, the two-lane AU queues, the Starfish `Feed()` pump and the ACB bind — only the
# CHOOSING is bypassed. No token, no ratingKey, no library, no sharing, nothing to configure but a
# TV address.
#
# What this tier CANNOT prove, and must never be read as proving: that the declaration it feeds is
# the declaration a real item would produce. It writes those five route fields itself, so the whole
# metadata -> plan -> apply_plan half is bypassed and a regression there passes here green. Nor
# does it reach resume, markers, Up Next, the timeline reporter, subtitle or audio-track SELECTION,
# or any transcode. It is the tier that separates "the player is broken" from "the library layer
# is broken" — not a replacement for either.

# Both regexes below therefore fail to match an old log outright, which is the intended loud
# failure — a scene must never grade a loop rate as if it were a frame rate.
#
