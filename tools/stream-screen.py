# stream-screen.py — live screen stream from the LG webOS TV to this Mac,
#                    plus a remote-control panel (keyboard + on-screen buttons).
#
# TWO frame sources (--source, default auto):
#
#   app     — the app's OWN capture stream (crate::capture, enabled by touching
#             `plxnative-capture` in that install's RUNTIME ROOT on the TV before
#             launch — /tmp for the stable install, /tmp/<app id> for a flavoured one;
#             see --runtime-dir): the app GPU-downscales its GLES frames and pushes
#             JPEGs over TCP :8910 for the shipped install, :8911 for a flavoured one
#             beside it (see --app-port; NEON libjpeg-turbo on-device: ~30fps at 960x540).
#             UI PLANE ONLY — the hardware video overlay is invisible to it, so
#             use it for UI/navigation work, not for watching playback.
#   service — the one-shot AV-framework capture service looped
#             (luna://com.webos.service.tv.capture/executeOneShot — the only path
#             that sees the video plane; there is NO continuous-capture API on this
#             webOS 4.5 build). Hard floor measured on 49SM9000PLA:
#                 1920x1080 JPEG ~0.5 s/frame (~1.9 fps)
#                 960x540   JPEG ~0.33 s/frame (~2.9 fps)
#   auto    — app when that port answers, else service; switches back to app
#             automatically when the port comes alive (checks every 5s).
#
# Wire modes (--codec, default mpeg): with a current app binary the app source is
# MPEG1 video in MPEG-TS (the TV's own libavcodec mpeg1video encoder, ~29fps at
# 960x540 in ~0.3-2.5Mbit) relayed to the page over a WebSocket (/ws) and decoded
# by the vendored jsmpeg (served at /jsmpeg.js) into a <canvas>. The JPEG path
# remains as the fallback: legacy app binaries, and PLAYBACK viewing — the GL
# capture can't see the video plane, so when the TS byte-flow stalls the service
# capture feeds JPEG frames and the page flips to its pipelined long-poll pull
# (/frame.jpg?after=<seq>; pull pacing keeps a slow uplink showing fewer frames,
# never older ones). Plain /frame.jpg (no query) = the latest frame, for scripting.
# The page switches automatically via /version, whose reply is
# "<ver> <mode> app=<id> runtime=<dir>" — the first two fields POSITIONAL (both this
# page and remote-dpad.py read them by index off a whitespace split), the install
# fields key=value after them. Anything new goes at the end, in key=value form.
#
# Usage:
#   ./stream-screen.py [--method DISPLAY|VIDEO|GRAPHIC] [--res 1920x1080|960x540|...]
#                      [--port 8909] [--fps N] [--open]
#     --method : plane(s) to capture. DISPLAY (default) = video + UI composited,
#                exactly as capture-screen.sh. VIDEO = overlay only, GRAPHIC = UI only.
#     --res    : capture resolution WxH (default 960x540; mpeg mode is always 960x540).
#     --port   : local HTTP port (default 8909).
#     --host   : bind address. 127.0.0.1 (default) = this machine only. Use
#                0.0.0.0 to let OTHER hosts on your network view it at
#                http://<this-machine-ip>:PORT (UNAUTHENTICATED — trusted LAN only).
#                To watch from off-network, prefer an SSH tunnel over --host 0.0.0.0:
#                on the remote host run  ssh -L 8909:127.0.0.1:8909 you@this-mac
#                then open http://127.0.0.1:8909/ there (keeps the default bind).
#     --fps    : cap the loop to at most N fps (default: unthrottled = as fast as
#                the service returns, ~2-3 fps). Lower it to reduce TV/CPU load.
#     --runtime-dir : the on-device RUNTIME ROOT of the install to drive — where its
#                `plxnative-*` dev triggers, its logs and the remote FIFO live.
#                Default: whatever `make -s print-rundir` answers, i.e. the Makefile's
#                own FLAVOR, which is tracked as `debug` — so an unqualified run drives
#                the developer install, and `make -s print-rundir FLAVOR=stable`
#                (= /tmp) is how you name the one users install.
#     --fifo   : the remote-control FIFO path outright, overriding --runtime-dir.
#     --app-port : the app capture stream's TCP port. Default: `make -s print-appport`
#                for whichever install --runtime-dir names — 8910 for the shipped app,
#                8911 for a flavoured one, so the two never contend for one listener —
#                or $TV_APP_PORT if set. Leave it alone and the picture and the keys stay
#                on the SAME install; pin it by hand and they can drift apart in silence,
#                because a port belonging to the other app answers just as readily as
#                one belonging to no app at all.
#     --open   : open the stream URL in the default browser on start (macOS `open`).
#     --no-control : stream only; don't open the control channel to the TV.
#
# Remote control: the served page captures your keyboard (arrows, Enter=OK,
# Backspace/Esc=Back, PgUp/PgDn=CH, P=Play/Pause, S=Stop) and shows clickable
# buttons; each POSTs to /key, which a held SSH connection writes into the app's
# on-device FIFO — `plxnative-remote`, inside that install's runtime root (see
# --runtime-dir) — and the app (crate::remote) drains it each frame and injects the
# key. Requires the plxnative app to be running (it creates the FIFO at boot).
# External input injection can't reach the app: the wayland compositor only reads a
# fixed evdev device set, and LG's keymanager luna API injects into the web-app layer,
# not our SDL/wayland path — hence the in-app FIFO.
#
# Environment overrides (same as capture-screen.sh):
#     TV_HOST (default: the gitignored .tv-host)  TV_USER (root)  TV_PASS (alpine)
#
# Auth: tools/tv-ssh -- the SSH key first; `sshpass -p $TV_PASS` only if the set refuses the key.
# Stop with Ctrl-C. Requires: python3 (stdlib only), ssh; sshpass only if no key.

    The path is a PARAMETER because it moved. This was the literal

    flavoured install's FIFO is `/tmp/<app id>/plxnative-remote`, and a driver still
    writing the stable path fails in the worst possible shape — `[ -p ]` finds nothing
    and `continue` swallows the token silently, once per key, while /key has already
    answered `sent` to the page. Keys that vanish with a success message are harder to
    diagnose than keys that error. So the path is resolved once, from
    `make -s print-rundir`, and printed in the banner and on the page.

    Both guards stay, and neither is about the flavour split. `[ -p ]` because the app
    mkfifos this at boot and a plain `>` against a missing path would leave a stray
    REGULAR file that the app then never reads (and never replaces). The 1s kill
    because a FIFO with no reader — a stale one, or the app mid-relaunch — blocks the
    write inside open(2) indefinitely, which would wedge every later key behind it.

    Deliberately NOT a mkdir: the root is shared by two uids that cannot be ordered
    (root arms triggers over ssh before first boot; the jailed app writes its logs
    there), so it has to be 1777, which the Makefile's BOOT_SH creates. A root-owned
    0755 directory conjured here would lock the app out of its own event log, and a
