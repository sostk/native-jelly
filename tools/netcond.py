"""netcond — a network-conditioning TCP proxy, for the failures you cannot otherwise reach.

Most of what is left to harden in the async model is FAULT-CONDITIONAL: the main thread parks in
`teardown` only when a PMS round trip stalls, and `stream.rs`'s deadlines (2 s connect, 15 s
`SO_RCVTIMEO`, 10 s `SO_SNDTIMEO`) only bite against a server that stops answering. On a healthy
LAN none of it happens — the measured teardown-join baseline is `demux 0ms media 0ms timeline 0ms`
(see `task::join`) — so every one of those findings was reasoned about rather than measured, which
is exactly the habit that has been wrong three times on this target already.

This sits between the TV and the PMS and makes the server misbehave on demand.

    ┌────────┐        ┌──────────────┐        ┌─────────┐
    │  TV    │──────▶ │ netcond.py   │──────▶ │  PMS    │
    │  app   │  :32401│ (this Mac)   │  :32400│         │
    └────────┘        └──────────────┘        └─────────┘

The PMS runs on this same Mac, so the proxy only needs a second port; point the app at it by
editing `PMS_PORT` in the gitignored `src/config.local.h`, then `make deploy` (the host/port are
compiled into `main.c`'s `nj_run` call — there is no runtime override).

## Modes

Live-switchable: the mode is re-read from the control file on every accept AND by the relay loops,
so it changes the behaviour of connections ALREADY OPEN. That is the whole point — the interesting
bug is a POST that was in flight when the server went quiet.

    pass                normal forwarding
    stall               relay nothing, in either direction, but hold the sockets OPEN. This is the
                        "accepted but silent" server: the app's recv blocks to SO_RCVTIMEO. THE
                        important one — it is what turns a join into a 15 s parked frame loop.
    blackhole           accept, never connect upstream, never answer. Same shape as `stall` for a
                        NEW connection; distinct because it never touches the real PMS.
    reject              close immediately (RST) — the fast-failure path
    delay:<ms>          forward, but add <ms> of latency to every chunk in both directions
    rate:<kbps>         forward, but SHAPE the link to <kbps> kilobits per second (see below)

Any mode may be scoped to matching requests only:

    stall@/:/timeline   stall ONLY connections whose first bytes contain "/:/timeline";
                        everything else passes normally.

That scoping is what makes a clean experiment possible: freeze the progress reporter while the
video stream keeps flowing, so the freeze you then measure at teardown is unambiguously the
reporter's POST and not a starved demuxer.

**Scoping was broken until 2026-08-23 and only the ACCEPT half worked.** `serve_conn` consulted
`applies()` (scope-aware) to decide reject/blackhole and to log, and then handed `relay` a bare
`Mode.split`, which throws the scope away — so `stall@/:/timeline` really stalled the relay of
every open connection, media stream included, and the experiment the scope exists to make clean
was not clean. `relay` now takes the connection's own first bytes and asks `applies()` per chunk,
which is what this docstring has claimed all along.

## `rate:<kbps>` — the throttled link

The one mode that is not a fault but a SPEED, and it exists for LG App Self Checklist #43 CASE1,
whose legs are 512 Kbps → 1 Mbps → 7 Mbps → 17.5 Mbps ("buffering should not occur constantly"),
and for #14's "abnormal end" under a degrading link. Without it those items are anecdote: nothing
else in this repo can make the server slow rather than dead.

    echo rate:512   > /tmp/netcond.mode      # 512 Kbps  — CASE1 leg 1
    echo rate:1000  > /tmp/netcond.mode      # 1 Mbps    — leg 2
    echo rate:7000  > /tmp/netcond.mode      # 7 Mbps    — leg 3
    echo rate:17500 > /tmp/netcond.mode      # 17.5 Mbps — leg 4
    echo pass       > /tmp/netcond.mode      # off

Four properties, each deliberate:

  * **kbps is KILOBITS, decimal** — 1 kbps = 1000 bits/s — because that is the unit the checklist
    item states its legs in. `rate:512` is 64,000 bytes/s, not 65,536.
  * **One bucket for the whole proxy, not one per connection.** `rate:` names a LINK, and a link
    is shared: the media GET and a `/:/timeline` POST racing each other is exactly the contention
    a real slow network produces, and per-connection buckets would hand each of them the full
    rate. Scope it (`rate:512@/library/parts`) when you want only the media stream throttled and
    the control calls left at full speed.
  * **It applies to connections ALREADY OPEN**, like every other mode here — the bucket's rate is
    re-read per chunk — so a transfer can be throttled, released and re-throttled MID-FLIGHT
    without touching the app. That is what makes one scripted run cover all four CASE1 legs
    instead of four launches.
  * **The bucket starts EMPTY.** A full one would hand the first quarter-second of every transfer
    a free burst at infinite speed, which is the shape that makes a throttle look like it worked
    when it did not.

## Use

    tools/netcond.py --listen 32401 --target 127.0.0.1:32400 \
        --allow-client <TV_IP>                                     # starts in `pass`
    echo 'stall@/:/timeline' > /tmp/netcond.mode                    # freeze the reporter
    echo 'rate:512'          > /tmp/netcond.mode                    # throttle the link
    echo pass                > /tmp/netcond.mode                    # let it go again

It logs one line per connection with the matched request line, so you can see what the app is
actually asking for, and a summary on exit. `--mode` sets the starting mode; `--control` moves the
control file. `--selftest` proves the shaper against a loopback transfer and exits, which is also
how to answer the macOS firewall question below without a television in the room.

**macOS trap, and it costs an afternoon every time: the application firewall silently drops
inbound connections to an ad-hoc python listener** — no refusal, no log line, the TV's open just
reads empty (verified 2026-08-11: netcond up, mode armed, zero requests logged). The GUI "allow
incoming connections?" prompt must be accepted ONCE PER PYTHON BINARY, so start netcond with a
human at the keyboard before going headless, and read "netcond logs nothing" as this rather than
as a quiet television. `tests/serve_fixtures.py` carries the same warning for the same reason.

Nothing here is deployed to the TV and nothing is secret: it forwards bytes it does not inspect
beyond the first line, and it never logs the query string — a PMS URL carries `X-Plex-Token`.
