"""Snapshot the glass materials over SYNTHETIC grounds, not over whatever poster is on screen.

Every material question in this app is a question about the bar over a ground, and until this
existed the ground was the hero's artwork: it advances on its own clock, two simulator instances
launched together drift apart within seconds, and a comparison assembled by matching log lines can
silently pair two different pictures. All three produced wrong answers during the tab-track work.

So this drives `ui::testpat` instead. A scripted ladder of grounds through the `pat:` remote token,
a shot at each rung, and a contact sheet out the other end:

    tools/glass-patterns.py                       # the default ladder
    tools/glass-patterns.py --pats flat:20,flat:60,edge,checker:24
    tools/glass-patterns.py --out /tmp/before   # …then again after a change, and diff the sheets
    tools/glass-patterns.py --lens "off:2,0,0 a:10,10,0 b:14,18,0"   # …one instance per rung

`--lens` is the second axis: each entry is `<name>:<bevel>,<lens>,<spec>`, written to that
instance's `nativejelly-tracklens`, so a run photographs every geometry against every ground and the
per-ground sheets stack the rungs for comparison. It is read once per process, which is why a rung
costs a whole simulator — and why they are launched together and driven in lockstep.

Sheets land in the output directory (default a scratch dir it prints), plus a table of what the bar
actually DREW at each rung — the plate's measured colour and the idle label's contrast over it —
because "does it look right" and "does it hold 3:1" are different questions and this answers both.

Requires a built simulator (`make sim`) and a PMS host in src/config.local.h, same as `make sim-run`.
