# Install (or remove, with --uninstall) the per-user launchd agent that runs
# `tools/build-gc.sh --auto` hourly, so the pressure-driven reclaim does not depend on a Claude
# Code SessionEnd firing (`.claude/hooks/build-gc-auto.sh`) — a machine idle between sessions, or
# running some other tool entirely, still gets swept.
#
# MACOS ONLY. launchd is the platform's own scheduler and the one already running every other
# per-user background agent on this host; there is no reason to reimplement a poller. On any other
# OS this prints the cron line that does the same job and exits 0 — a non-zero exit here would
# make this the one setup step that fails a fresh Linux dev machine outright, for a feature that
# machine can still get by pasting one line into its own crontab.
#
# WHAT IT INSTALLS. `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nativejelly.build-gc.plist`: `StartInterval 3600`
# (once an hour — `--auto`'s own lock and idle guard make a missed or doubled tick harmless, so
# there is no reason to poll faster), `RunAtLoad false` (do not fire the moment this plist loads;
# the first real run is the first scheduled tick, not login), and `LowPriorityIO` + `Nice` +
# `ProcessType Background` so an hourly `du` sweep across a fleet never contends with whatever the
# user is actually doing. It always launches the MAIN checkout's own `tools/build-gc.sh --auto` —
# resolved through `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, the SAME lookup the SessionEnd hook uses, and
# for the same reason: running this installer FROM a lane must not bake that lane's own path into
# a plist that outlives it. `$0`'s own directory is the fallback, used only when git cannot answer
# (no repository, `git` missing) rather than a checkout this installer was run from at all.
#
# `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u)` / `bootout`, not the deprecated `load`/`unload` — Apple's own
# guidance since 10.11, and the pair this script uses for BOTH install and uninstall makes the
# whole thing idempotent: bootout-then-bootstrap on install (so re-running after an edit picks up
# the new plist rather than leaving the old one loaded) and bootout-then-remove on uninstall.
#
# TIME MACHINE. If `tmutil destinationinfo` succeeds (a destination is configured — an unconfigured
# host prints nothing useful and would make this a false positive on every fresh machine), and
# `$NJ_FLEET_DIR` (default ~/plx-fleet — the external lane target dirs `tools/build-gc.sh`
# reclaims from) exists, exclude it with `tmutil addexclusion` (sticky, no `-p`, i.e. the exclusion
# itself is what persists, not a path-only entry Time Machine forgets across a rename) — backing up
# multi-gigabyte, fully rebuildable cargo output on an hourly cadence is exactly the kind of cost
# this whole feature exists to avoid, just paid to a backup volume instead of the boot disk.
#
# THIS SCRIPT NEVER RUNS ITSELF. Installing a hidden per-user background job is something the
# person running Claude Code must ask for, in their own words — an agent must never call this
# script on its own initiative (see AGENTS.md's Television and release safety section for the
# same rule applied to the TV: exceptional actions need the human to say so).
