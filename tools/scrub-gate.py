"""Refuse to publish a file that carries a value from a gitignored private file.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-26 a batch of captured device logs was committed and pushed carrying a
third-party server's address, port, machine hash, custom domain and its owner's handle. The
pre-commit check that should have stopped it *computed the match count and printed it* instead of
gating on it, and the push went out anyway. This is that check, written so it cannot be ignored:
a match is a non-zero exit.

It NEVER prints the matched value -- that is the same leak by a shorter route -- only the count.

It reuses `.claude/hooks/outbound-guard.py`'s own `load_secrets` and `findings`, so the gate and the
PreToolUse hook cannot drift apart. The hook guards command TEXT (a PR body, a heredoc); this guards
file CONTENT, which is the hole the 2026-08-26 leak went through.

# through by a marker comment any file could grow. The LITERAL check still applies to them in
