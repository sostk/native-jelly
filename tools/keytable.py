"""keytable.py — the key ladder's behaviour, as a table you can diff.

The loop's key handler lives inside the SDL event loop, so no host test executes any of it. Its
correctness is also ORDER-dependent by design — an earlier guard subsumes a later one it overlaps
with — and reordering compiles, keeps the suite green, and silently changes behaviour.

No arm count is given, and no example guard: the ladder has been shrinking one migration at a time
(three arms left it in restructure phase 5b, every remaining player arm in phase 12), so both rot
here without anything failing. The clearest example used to be the player's failure read-out, whose
guard swallowed every key the read-out did not draw; that precedence is now the first condition of
`PlayerScreen::handle_key` rather than an arm's height in a chain.

So before that ladder is touched, its behaviour has to be written down. This drives the SIMULATOR
through (screen x key) and records, for every press, the focus fingerprint before and after — i.e.
what the key actually did. The result is a golden table. Refactor, re-run, diff: an empty diff is
the evidence the refactor did not change behaviour, and a non-empty one names the arm that moved.

    tools/keytable.py --out tests/keytable.json          # record
    tools/keytable.py --check tests/keytable.json        # re-record and diff against it

Requires `make sim` to have been built (honouring `SIM_TDIR` if the lane set one). Never touches
the television. Each screen gets its own instance root, so several of these can run at once (that
is the whole point of `SIM_DIR`).

**What it can and cannot see.** A row is the FOCUS fingerprint before and after, so this grades
where a key moved the user and nothing else. It is blind to the two effects a press has on state no
screen owns — the player HUD's dismissal and an armed tvOS click — which is why the unsupported-key
invariant is graded twice: here for "moves nothing on any screen", and in `app.rs`'s
`unsupported_key_tests` for "touches nothing global". Neither half implies the other.

**A fingerprint carries RATING KEYS, so part of this table is a fact about one library and one
moment, not about the ladder.** Two rows drift on their own: `home` samples whichever hero the 8 s
auto-flip has landed on, and any row is keyed to whatever the server's hubs held when it was
recorded. A re-record on another day, or against another PMS, therefore diffs on `rk=` while every
structural field (`route`, `hf`, `row`, `col`, `zone`, `card`, `sec`) is identical — read that as
noise, and read a change in a STRUCTURAL field as the regression. Diffing the two by eye is the
job; nothing here is asserted by `make check`.

Two triggers are armed in every root:
  * `nativejelly-focus`  — the fingerprint itself (`crate::focusprobe`)
  * `nativejelly-noidle` — the frame gate off. A settled screen stops presenting, and while the
    fingerprint is logged from the frame loop rather than from a present, a screen that never
    repaints also never redraws what a key changed. Arming it keeps the run honest and costs
    nothing here; on the device it would cost the idle measurement, which is why it is DIAG-exempt.

# The keys the ladder dispatches on. `okdown`/`okup` are the split halves — the only way to drive a
# press-and-hold past `press::LONG_MS`, which is a different arm from a tap and has to be recorded
# as one.
#
# **`k:<sym>,<wcode>` presses a RAW pair** (`app.rs`'s `remote_token_key`), which is the only way to
# reach a key the mnemonic map does not name — and therefore the only way this harness can grade
# what an UNSUPPORTED key does, which is LG checklist item 40. The four in the middle of the script
# are there for one question each, and they are placed between `right` and `ok` so that the screen
# they are asked on is still the one the trigger booted:
#   k:53,34   the digit `5`, sym '5' + `SDL_SCANCODE_5` — exactly as the television spells it.
#             Until 2026-08-23 `page_dir` read scancode 34 as the channel rocker, so this PAGED the
#             Library grid. It must now move nothing, anywhere.
#   k:0,301   the real CH-down rocker (evdev 403), which must still page the Library…
#   k:0,300   …and the real CH-up, which pages back, so the script's later rows are unperturbed.
#   k:0,269   HOME — `SDL_SCANCODE_AC_HOME`, evdev 172. Unbound by decision, not by omission
#             (`docs/remote-keys.md` §HOME); the row that records it staying inert is the evidence.
#
# `back` is NOT here, and the comment that used to explain why said it "is last in every script
# because at a screen's root it EXITS the app" — which described neither the list (there was no
# `back` in it to be last) nor the behaviour. A root BACK has not quit since 2026-08-21, and since
# 2026-09-03 it does not ask either: it hands the screen to the television's own Home
# (`tv::home::go_home`) with the app still running. Adding it is a real and worthwhile option — `home`
# is in SCREENS, and the ladder's whole BACK cascade is currently uncharacterised — but it costs a
# re-record of `tests/keytable.json`, and a script whose run reaches a root has to relaunch before
# the next screen's, because the app is no longer the foreground surface.
