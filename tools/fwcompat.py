"""Resolve this binary against 14 real LG firmwares, offline, on the dev machine.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The error class that matters for portability is invisible at link time: the app
resolves FFmpeg, libcurl and libAcbAPI at RUNTIME and bundles its own FFmpeg, so nothing in the
build can tell you a television lacks a library or a symbol — the dynamic loader finds out, at
`exec()`, with nothing in the event log.
The only previous check for that was `webosbrew-ipk-verify`, which ships as an arm64 `.deb` and so
runs in CI on Linux and NOWHERE on this Mac. That put a full push-and-wait between "I changed a
`#[link]`" and "I know whether it still loads".

This is that check, locally. It reads the same firmware databases the webosbrew tool does — the
`webosbrew-toolbox-fw-symbols` package, which is not a checker but an INVENTORY: for 14 real
firmware images, every library, its `DT_NEEDED`, and its complete exported-symbol list, keyed by
webOS release. Nothing here is inferred; a "yes" means the symbol is in that firmware's table.

WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT TELL YOU. It answers exactly one question — *would the dynamic loader be
able to start this binary, and would every symbol it imports resolve?* That question is the whole
of the webOS 5 port's first blocker and it is worth automating. It says NOTHING about behaviour:
a firmware can export `AcbAPI_setMediaVideoData` and still refuse to put a picture on the video
plane. Do not read a green matrix as "it works on webOS 5"; read it as "it starts".

    tools/fwcompat.py --release 5.3.1          # one release, with the full missing list
    tools/fwcompat.py --shipped pkg pkg/libavformat-plx.so.63   # a bundled library, siblings shipped
    tools/fwcompat.py --lib libSDL2-2.0.so.0 --grep webOS      # what does that library export?
    tools/fwcompat.py --inventory libAcbAPI libavformat        # which releases carry these?

The database (~317 MB unpacked) is fetched once into ~/.cache/nativejelly/fwsym and reused. Pass
--db to point at an existing extraction. Everything after the download is offline.
