# abr-scenario.sh — run ONE Auto/ABR scenario against the host simulator over a shaped link,
# and print what the controller did with it.
#
#   tools/abr-scenario.sh <name> <item-key> "<leg> [<leg> …]"
#
# where a leg is `<at_s>:<netcond-mode>`, e.g. `0:pass 40:rate:2500 100:rate:16000`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is not `tests/run.py --server`.
#
# The harness's two `link_profile` cases are the right shape and cannot answer this question.
# `auto_original_squeeze` says so in its own note — "the squeeze is never lifted, deliberately: the
# question is whether Auto ever leaves, not whether it recovers when the link does" — and
# `auto_link_squeeze` lifts the squeeze to `pass`, which on a gigabit LAN is a link hundreds of
# times the source. Neither reaches the régime the device failed in.
#
# **That régime is a RATIO, not a rate.** Auto's Original gate needs
# `conservative_kbps >= vbr_allowance_pm * source`, and `conservative_kbps` is `slow * (1 - unc)`
# with `unc` floored at 200 pm — so admission needs `slow >= 1.350/0.800 = 1.6875 x source`, and
# the interesting band is `1.0 x source < link < 1.69 x source`: fast enough to carry the film,
# too slow for the model to say so. Releasing to `pass` jumps clean over it. The device landed
# inside it (a 25 264 kbps 4K DV source on a ~38 Mbps link, 1.5x) and blinked twice.
#
# So the legs here are written as MULTIPLES of the measured source bitrate, resolved per item.
#
# HOST ONLY, and deliberately. This runs `nativejelly-sim` with the clock sink armed, so the whole
# path between the socket and the decoder is real — both AVIO transports, `ff.rs`'s demux, the AU
# queues and their byte-cap backpressure, the feed-ahead throttle, the ABR controller and its
# transactions. Nothing decodes, and nothing measured here is a device measurement: every
# heartbeat carries `sim=1`. What it CAN answer is the only question this scenario asks — how many
# times did the controller change its mind, and what did it settle on.
#
# netcond binds LOOPBACK here, which also sidesteps the macOS application firewall: the prompt
# that silently drops a TV's connections to an ad-hoc python listener never appears for 127.0.0.1.
