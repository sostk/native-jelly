#                                runtime roots, so they have their own crash logs; this picks one.
#
# The C tracer (src/main.c) writes, per crash:
#     *** SIGNAL <n> (<name>) addr=0x… pc=0x… lr=0x…
#     reg: sp=0x… fp=0x… ip=0x… cpsr=0x… r0=0x… … r10=0x…     (2026-08-29 and later builds)
#     at:  <the /proc/self/maps line containing pc or lr>     (which library faulted)
#     bin: <the maps line for our own binary>                 (our load base)
# and then re-raises to SIG_DFL so SAM records a real signal death (exit_status = the bare signal
# number). That does NOT also produce a crashd backtrace — cores are disabled, see the librdx
# section at the bottom — so the record below is the evidence, not a preamble to a better one.
# Turning pc into a source line needs `pc - load_base` fed to addr2line — this script is
# the only thing in the repo that does that arithmetic.
#
# TWO LOGS, and the difference matters after a relaunch:
#   <runtime root>/plxnative-crash.log   append-only, SURVIVES the relaunch  <- read this one
#   <runtime root>/plxnative-events.log  truncated at every launch           <- already gone
# The NAMES are the same for both installs; only the root differs — `/tmp` for the stable
# install, `/tmp/<app id>` for a flavoured one. Ask for the one you mean with
# `make -s print-rundir FLAVOR=<f>`; this script derives CRASHLOG/STDERRLOG from it below.
# Do not carry an absolute path out of here into a by-hand `cat`: at the default flavour
# `/tmp/plxnative-crash.log` is the OTHER install's log, it exists, it is append-only, and it
# will hand you a perfectly plausible crash that has nothing to do with the build you are
# triaging.
#
# Config: TV host, app id, install directory and runtime root all come from `make -s print-…`.
# Nothing about the network or any credential is stored here.
