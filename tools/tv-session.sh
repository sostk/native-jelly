#

#                     exist (an already-armed nativejelly-servers also survives with --keep)
#   --guest           boot as tests/manifest.local.json's managed TEST USER, never the owner.
#                     Reuses run.py's own identity resolution (fetch_managed_user_token, the

#                     never disagree about what "guest" means. REFUSES (exit 1) rather than
#                     falling through to the owner when no manifest.local.json/test_user is
#                     configured — see the 2026-09-10 postmortem below `cmd_up`'s definition:
#                     a caller asked for a guest, got the owner silently, and a real playback
#                     wrote progress into the household account.
#   --owner           boot as the household account (the config.local.h owner token). This is
#                     also what a bare `up` does with neither flag — spelling it out is for a
#                     script that wants the choice to be visible in its own command line.
#   --mock            with --guest, use only tests/mock_pms.py at the configured PMS endpoint.
#                     Verifies its synthetic identity; never uses an account token or contacts plex.tv.
#   --dry-run         resolve and print the identity `up` would use (including a real --guest
#                     token lookup, which touches plex.tv but never the TV) and the shape of the
#                     commands it would run, then exit 0 without contacting the television at all.
#   --stream[=PORT]   also start tools/stream-screen.py for a live browser view (default 8909)
#                     STREAM_RES=480x270 makes mpeg encode ~4x cheaper (see the skill)
#   --remote[=PORT]   like --stream, but ALSO publish an authenticated, D-pad-only page over an
#                     HTTPS tunnel so the TV can be watched and driven from a PHONE, off-network
#                     (default dpad port 8908). Prints a URL + generated password; `down` revokes
#                     both. Needs cloudflared (brew install cloudflared). See the skill for why
#                     this is a tunnel and never a router port forward.
#   --no-token        boot with no injected token (exercises the QR sign-in flow, or the
#                     who's-watching picker for a stored session — a THIRD identity, distinct
#                     from both --guest and --owner)
#   --arm NAME[=VAL]  also arm trigger nativejelly-NAME (repeatable), written with the screen's own
#                     triggers BEFORE the launch, which is the only time a boot trigger is read.
#                     For a scene's extras, e.g. `--arm menu=1 --arm submenuosc=900 --arm framedrop=25`
#   --keep            do not clear existing triggers first (rarely what you want)
#
# SCREEN OFF is a panel state, not an app state. `luna://com.webos.service.tvpower/power/
# turnOffScreen` blanks the picture with the set still on, the app still running and playback
# still decoding — it does NOT deliver the SDL background events (`0x103`/`0x104`) that make
# `app.rs` suspend the buffer-feed and drop to Home, which is the failure worth ruling out before
# using it: a suspended feed reads as a total ABR regression rather than as an obviously blank
# screen. Device-confirmed on webOS 4.10.0 (2026-08-27), and the whole P1/P1b device corpus was
# taken this way. `power/turnOnScreen` is the reverse; both are on this firmware's api-permissions
# list, unlike the newer-webOS `power/turnOff` the wake-tv skill records as `Unknown method` here.
#
# USE IT FOR the measurement tiers — ABR, transaction cost, anything read out of the event log —
# where it saves the panel over long runs and costs nothing. DO NOT use it for the fps scenes,
# `shot`, or the capture stream: `nj_machine::idle` gates presents and the panel is the thing those
# measure, so a dark screen makes them either meaningless or silently wrong.
# The one exception is a scene on the PLAYER route: the bound video plane forces presents
# (`nj_machine::idle`'s VIDEO_PLANE gate), so its frame times are real with the panel off
# (docs/player-submenus.md, "Device frame-time check").
#
# SOUND is the television's own mute, separate from the panel above and from playback: it silences
# whatever the set would otherwise put out, panel on or off, app running or not.
# `luna://com.webos.service.audio/setMuted` flips the flag and `com.webos.service.audio/getVolume`
# reads it back. Both calls were exercised by hand on the set on 2026-09-19 — `setMuted` returned
# success and an independent `getVolume` then reported `muted:true` — but the SUBCOMMAND around
# them is host-tested only and has never run against a television. Whoever uses it first: watch
# what the set actually does and record it. `off`/`on` call `setMuted` and then RE-READ `getVolume` to
# confirm, rather than trusting `setMuted`'s own `returnValue` — the same discipline `ensure_binary`
# already uses for a deploy. `status` only reads `getVolume`. Like `screen`, this drives the set and
# takes the TV lock.
#
# THIS IS THE SANCTIONED PATH for muting the television. Before it existed, the only ways to
# silence a run were the physical remote or a raw `luna-send` reached through
# `NJ_TV_LOCK_BYPASS=1` around the lock guard — neither belongs in an automated lane, and the
# bypass in particular is meant for a human who knows the set is theirs, not for routine muting. No
# lane needs it for this: `tv-session.sh sound off` is the tool.
#
# It does NOT restore sound at teardown — `down` does not call it — because a lane that muted for
# its own reasons is the only one that knows when unmuting is correct; restoring automatically
# would fight a human who muted the set on purpose before handing it to a lane.
#
# THE TV LOCK: every subcommand that DRIVES the set (up, key, click, shot, down) requires the
# television's lock and refuses when another lane holds it; `status` and `log` are read-only and
# only name the holder. Take one for a whole session rather than letting each command take its own
# 10-minute implicit lease — the gap between two of your own commands is exactly where another
# job lands:  tools/tv-lock.sh acquire --why "…"  …  tools/tv-lock.sh release.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: every on-device task needs the same fragile ritual, and each step fails
# silently in its own way — a sleeping TV makes every assertion read as a regression, a
# stale binary means you are testing yesterday's build, a leftover trigger silently changes
# which screen you land on AND suppresses the who's-watching picker, and SAM keeps stale
# "running" state so a launch without a close-first is a no-op — and there are now TWO installs
# on the one television, so every step also has to say which of them it meant, or the ticks below
# are green against the other app's log. This asserts each step instead of assuming it.
# See .agents/skills/tv-session/SKILL.md.
#
# Config: TV host from $TV, else the Makefile's TV default. The app id, the install directory

# from the gitignored src/config.local.h at runtime, written straight to the TV in its own ssh
# round-trip, and never printed. Nothing about the network or any credential lives here.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ the WAN cut ----
# "Offline mode" is a household whose LAN is up and whose uplink is down. Nothing on a desk can
# take the router's uplink away for ONE device deterministically, so this does it on the set
# itself, in two halves because the firmware only has one of the two tools (probed 2026-09-05):
#   * v4: a netfilter chain on OUTPUT (iptables 1.6, filter table loaded) REJECTS every packet
#     not bound for the LAN, plus every DNS query anywhere — the router would otherwise still
#     resolve `plex.direct` through its own uplink, which is the half of "offline" that matters;
#   * v6: there is NO ip6tables filter table (`ip6_tables` is not in the kernel's modules), so
#     the cut is an `unreachable 2000::/3` route — more specific than either default route, so
#     no metric contest with connman's or the RA's, and less specific than the on-link /64s, so
#     LAN v6 keeps routing and neighbour discovery is untouched. DNS is v4 here (connman's
#     resolv.conf names the router's v4 address), so the v4 chain already covers it.
# REJECT / unreachable rather than DROP, so a dead destination fails at once instead of burning a
# connect budget: the case graded is "the app reaches the LAN server", not "how long a timeout takes".
#
# FAIL-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION. `off` writes the restore script ON THE SET and starts a watchdog
# there (`nohup sh -c 'sleep TTL; sh restore'`), so a harness that dies, a Mac that sleeps and an
# ssh that drops all end with the television back online without anybody's help. `on` runs the
# same restore and kills the watchdog. Idempotent both ways. The marker is outside the
# `nativejelly-*` prefix, like the lock, so it neither suppresses the picker nor gets swept.
#
# Two things this cannot claim, stated so nobody grades them from it: a REJECT is not what a
# real router does with its uplink down (that is usually silence), and the jail's resolver view
# is the app's business — read `net: curl rc=6` / `nowan` lines in the app's OWN log, never this
# script's status, to say what the app saw.
