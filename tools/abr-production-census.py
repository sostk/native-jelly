"""M3 — measure what a rung actually COSTS the server, per actuator.

`HlsActuatorCatalog::measured()` carries a `production_load_pm` for each of its thirteen points,
and eleven of the thirteen are not measurements. `ladder.rs` says so at the table: two points are
empirical and the rest are "an ordering assumption". That table is one half of the two-constraint
admission rule — the half that refuses 4K on a fast link in front of a loaded PMS — so eleven
unmeasured numbers decide a real behaviour, and `docs/adaptive-playback-plan.md` blocks increment
I9 on this measurement for exactly that reason.

**What is measured.** For each request ceiling, one short-lived transcode session is registered and
N consecutive segments are fetched, giving

    rho = total_fetch_ms / media_duration_ms

per segment — the same quantity `SegmentSample::production_ratio_pm` computes at runtime, in the
same units, so the census and the controller cannot mean different things by it. rho is reported
COLD (the first segment, which the encoder has not produced ahead of) and WARM (the median of the
rest), because those are different questions and the catalog answers only the second.

**Why the comparison is on the RESIDUAL.** `production_load_pm` is a RELATIVE work figure
normalised so `P1080High` reads 1000, not an absolute ratio. Every fetch also carries a
per-segment overhead that has nothing to do with the rung — connection, request, container
muxing — so comparing raw rho against the table compares two different quantities. The residual

    load_j = 1000 * (rho_j - rho_floor) / (rho_top - rho_floor)

removes it, taking `rho_floor` from the lowest rung actually measured and `rho_top` from
`P1080High`, which is the point the table is normalised on. This mirrors `predicted_ratio_pm`'s
own construction rather than inventing a comparison.

**Both pacing legs are run and they are not interchangeable.** Back-to-back requests measure how
fast the encoder CAN produce; `--pace 2.0` holds one request per two seconds of media, which is
what a player actually does and therefore what the runtime ratio is compared against. The paced
leg is the one the catalog is meant to match; the back-to-back leg is reported beside it because
their difference IS the just-in-time term.

**Falsification, stated before the run** (`docs/adaptive-playback-plan.md` M3): residual loads
within +/-15% of the table uphold the "inert argmax" finding and keep the deferred quality scoring
closed. Any mid-ladder load off by more than 25% means the argmax is a re-parameterisation on
fresh numbers and has to be argued on those. This tool prints the verdict rather than leaving it
to be eyeballed.

**Privacy.** Nothing here talks to the PMS itself. Every request goes through
`tools/pms-hls-probe.py`, which registers and stops its own session and refuses to write an
artifact containing a token, a server address, a session id, a rating key or a title. This tool
reads only that tool's already-redacted `report.json`, and its own output carries rung numbers and
timings — never the item it measured, only the overlay KEY the operator passed, which is a shape
name (`movie_h264_ac3_1080p`) and not an identifier on anybody's server.

Runs on the dev Mac against the configured PMS. No television, no lock, no `make`.

    **This is the discriminator the first census lacked, and without it the headline finding is

    clock than the high ones — and concluded the table is indexed by the wrong variable. There is a
    second explanation that the same numbers also fit and that nothing recorded could separate:
    **at a ceiling above what the source needs, PMS may stop transcoding and copy the video**, so
    the cheapest column would not be a cheap transcode at all but a REMUX, and a remux does not
    belong on a curve of encoder cost.

    The 4K row is what makes it worth checking rather than assuming. Against a 1080p source the
    `Uhd` request measured 58 pm where `P1080High` measured 105 — the same output raster (PMS never
    upscales), the same source, half the work. Two requests that differ only in a bitrate ceiling
    neither of which binds should not differ by 2x, and "one of them stopped re-encoding" is the
    obvious reason they might.

    So: `codec`, `width x height` and the delivered rate per rung. If the cheap rows come back at
    the SOURCE's own rate they are copies and the inversion is an artefact of mixing two operations;
    if they come back re-encoded at their own rate, the inversion is real and the table's variable
