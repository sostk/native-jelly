# remote-dpad.py — a LOCKED-DOWN front end for tools/stream-screen.py, meant to be
# the only thing an off-network viewer can reach.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN JUST EXPOSING stream-screen.py
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# stream-screen.py is the LAN dev tool and its own header says so: unauthenticated,
# "trusted LAN only". Its page can also do rather more than watch — it forwards
# `ck:X,Y` pointer clicks, play/stop/channel tokens and any keystroke it maps. That
# is exactly right at a desk and exactly wrong through a public URL.
#
# So this process, not the network, is where the limits live:
#
#   * HTTP Basic auth on EVERY request, compared with hmac.compare_digest.
#   * An ALLOW-LIST of six D-pad tokens (up/down/left/right/ok/back). Anything else
#     — a `ck:` click, `play`, `stop`, a bare keystroke — is refused with 403 and
#     never reaches the TV. This is the point of the whole file: even someone
#     holding the URL *and* the password can only press D-pad keys.
#   * A short route table. No directory serving, no proxy of arbitrary paths.
#   * Binds 127.0.0.1 by default, because the intended front door is a tunnel
#     (cloudflared/ssh) terminating locally — never a router port forward. Opening
#     a port to this LAN would expose the TV's own SSH, which on a webosbrew-rooted
#     set is the published default root password. It would also put the Basic auth
#     password on the wire in cleartext, several times a second.
#
# TRANSPORT: MPEG1 OVER A WEBSOCKET, WITH JPEG AS THE FALLBACK
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# The first version of this file spoke only stream-screen.py's JPEG pull path
# (/frame.jpg?after=<seq>) because a long-poll is trivially proxyable. Measured
# through a cloudflared tunnel that turned out to be the wrong trade:
#
#     local, 1 poller  12.3 fps     tunnel round trip   511 ms
#     local, 4 pollers 12.2 fps     tunnel, 1 poller    7.0 fps
#     local, 8 pollers 12.3 fps     tunnel, 4 pollers   7.6 fps
#
# Two things fall out. Concurrency buys nothing (the JPEG path itself caps ~12 fps),
# and one HTTP round trip PER FRAME cannot outrun a 511 ms RTT no matter how it is
# pipelined. A WebSocket makes RTT a latency cost instead of a throughput cost — the
# stream is continuous, so frames arrive at the rate they are produced — and MPEG1
# has inter-frame compression where JPEG sends every pixel every time (~22 KB/frame
# measured, i.e. ~2 Mbit/s for 12 fps against MPEG1's documented 0.3-2.5 Mbit/s for
# ~29 fps).
#
# So /ws is relayed as a RAW BYTE PIPE: auth happens on the handshake, and after the
# 101 this process understands nothing about WebSocket framing and does not need to.
# That is deliberate — implementing RFC6455 masking here would be a second protocol's
# worth of ways to get it wrong, in the file whose job is to be small enough to audit.
#
# The WS token, and why it is not the Basic password: a browser cannot attach an
# Authorization header to a WebSocket handshake (the JS API has no way to set one),
# so `wss://` would arrive unauthenticated. The page — which is only ever served
# AFTER Basic auth — therefore carries a per-process random token that /ws checks.
# It is exactly as secret as the password and travels only inside TLS.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/remote-dpad.py [--port 8908] [--upstream 8909] [--user tv] [--password SECRET]
#                        [--runtime-dir DIR] [--fifo PATH]
#   (no --password: one is generated and printed once at startup)
#
# It is spelled `--password` in full and must stay that way here. argparse accepts any
# unambiguous PREFIX, so `--pass` — which this block said for a while — works today and
# stops working the moment a second `--pass*` option exists, failing in every recipe that
# copied it at once, naming a flag the documentation told the reader to type.
#
# --runtime-dir / --fifo name the INSTALL being driven — two builds share the dev
# television now, each with its own runtime root (/tmp for the stable install,
# /tmp/<app id> for a flavoured one) and so its own remote FIFO. They are the same
# option names stream-screen.py takes, so one caller can pass one pair down to both.
# Here they are ECHOED, never acted on: this process opens no FIFO and no SSH (see the
# note at DPAD), and the page reports the upstream's OWN answer, which is the one that
# decides where a keypress actually lands.
#
# Start the upstream with `--source app` so the picture is the app's own GLES frames.
# The picture is then UI-PLANE ONLY — GL cannot see the hardware video overlay, so
# playback is a black rectangle. That is the capture source, not a fault here.

from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, ThreadingHTTPServer

# The ONLY tokens that may reach the TV's FIFO. Names are the app's own
# (crate::remote drains `nativejelly-remote` inside that install's runtime root — /tmp
# for the stable install, /tmp/<app id> for a flavoured one). This file never touches
# that path: an allowed token is forwarded to stream-screen.py's /key, and the held
# SSH writer THERE resolves and writes the FIFO. Keeping the path in exactly one
# process is deliberate — two copies of it would be two chances to drive the wrong
# install, and a key sent to the wrong install disappears without an error.
#
# `okdown`/`okup` are the SPLIT halves of OK and they are what make a press-and-hold
# possible — held past `press::LONG_MS` (500 ms) the app opens the card context menu,
# which is a real feature of the product and unreachable from a `ok` tap. The button
# therefore sends edges rather than taps: a quick press is still a tap because the
# app measures the interval, so this is strictly MORE faithful to the Magic Remote
# than a synthetic `ok`, not a loosening of it.
#
# Still absent, and deliberately: `ck:X,Y` pointer clicks (a remote viewer aiming at
# coordinates on a picture they may be seeing seconds late) and the transport keys.
