Emits `pkg/icon.png` (80), `pkg/largeIcon.png` (130) and, for the webosbrew channel listing,
`pkg/icon160.png` / `pkg/icon320.png`. With `--splash` it also emits `pkg/splash.png` at exactly
1920x1080, the size `splashBackground` requires and the size all four native-app splashes on the
dev TV actually are (Amazon, Apple TV, Netflix, YouTube — checked, since the field is documented
in a web-app context and it was not obvious it applies to `type: "native"` at all; it does).
Re-running this is the only supported way to change any of them.

**`--badge=TEXT` cuts the set for a SECOND INSTALL** — the developer build that lives beside the
released app on the same television (`com.sostk.nativejelly.debug`; the Makefile's FLAVOR block is the
account). The tiles sit side by side in the launcher, so the badge's whole job is to be unmistakable
at the smallest size webOS ever draws.

It is a full-bleed BOTTOM BAR, and both halves of that are load-bearing rather than taste:

  * **Bottom, not a corner ribbon or dot.** `appinfo.json`'s `iconColor` paints the launcher tile
    *behind* the icon, and `ci/check-package.py` compares it against the icon's own corner pixel —
    a gate that exists because a gold tile shipped under a black icon until 2026-08-02 and was
    invisible in every file, since it only exists once the system composites. A corner mark changes
    pixel (1,1) and would fail it by ~240 levels; a bottom bar leaves the corner alone, so ONE
    `iconColor` stays correct for both flavours and the badge needs no descriptor change at all.
  * **A bar, not a whole-tile tint.** Tinting the tile means moving `iconColor` in lockstep or
    reproducing exactly the defect above — and it stops looking like the product.

The colours are the app's own `theme::RESUME_FILL` amber over `AMBER_950` ink, i.e. a pair the
design system already uses on a filled control, so the badge is on-brand while being the one thing
on the tile that could not be mistaken for the release artwork. The text colour is DERIVED from the
fill by relative luminance rather than fixed, so a different `--badge-fill` cannot silently produce
grey-on-grey.

The bar is rasterized NATIVELY at each output size (never scaled from one master), because a 3-px
stroke scaled 4x down is a smear where a 3-px stroke drawn at 80 is a stroke.

Why a script and not four exports: the target is not "the logo, scaled". LG's icon guide
(webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/guides/icon) specifies a **126x126 background panel** with the
logo inside a **115x115 area plus >=5px padding** — so a master's own canvas margins may be wrong
by any amount, and exporting it at four sizes would silently inherit that. This measures the
master's INK and scales the master until the ink lands where LG wants it, so the result depends on
the logo rather than on how the master was cropped.

Two things measured off the TV's own store icons (`115x115` cache files pulled from
`/media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/*/`), which is what the launcher actually renders:

  * **Real tiles are full-bleed opaque squares**, not transparent cut-outs — the launcher supplies
    the rounded corners. Apple TV and Spotify are on black, Netflix and YouTube on white, so a dark
    tile is on-style and needs no lightening.
  * **The logo occupies 70-91% of the tile width** (Apple TV 70, Spotify 74, Netflix 80, YouTube
    91). We take 78%, which lands mid-pack and satisfies the >=5px rule at every emitted size.

**It scales the whole master and crops, rather than cutting the logo out and pasting it onto a
flat panel.** The pasting version worked only because the first master's background was pure
`#000` everywhere; a master with a vignette, glow or gradient carries those pixels inside the ink
bbox and none outside it, so pasting stamps a visible rectangle of slightly-wrong background into
the tile — the same class of seam as a mismatched `iconColor`, and harder to spot because it is a
few levels rather than a colour. Scaling the whole canvas keeps the background continuous by
construction, at no cost when the background *is* flat.

`--band=N` selects one horizontal band of ink when the master is a stacked lockup (bands are
numbered from the top; the default uses all of them). This is a legibility lever, not a taste one:
a secondary line that is under ~10% of the ink height renders about **4 px tall at the 130 px
launcher size** and 2.5 px at 80 — below the point where a glyph is a glyph. Every reference icon
that carries readable text carries ONE line of it at aspect 3.1-4.2; the only reference with a 2:1
lockup (Apple TV) has no small text at all. The script prints each band's projected height so the
decision is made against a number.

It also prints the `iconColor` the master implies. That field paints the launcher tile *behind*
the icon, so when it disagrees with the icon's own background the tile shows a hard-edged
rectangle — shipped that way until 2026-08-02, gold tile under a black icon. `ci/check-package.py`
asserts the two agree.
