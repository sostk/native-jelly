"""Serialize `make check` machine-wide with a single flock, across every worktree.

Several agent worktrees running `make check` at once thrash one Mac: each is a cold
412k-line rustc build (~1 GB RSS), and on 2026-09-28 seven concurrent runs pushed swap
to 9-15 GB and stretched a ~10-minute run to 60 minutes. Queuing them is strictly
faster for everyone, and a `flock`-backed lock file does that without a daemon: the
kernel releases the lock the instant the holding process dies, so there is never a
stale lock to clean up by hand (unlike a mkdir/pidfile scheme).

Usage:
    check-lock.py [--lock PATH] [--timeout SECONDS] -- CMD...

The lock file defaults to `${NJ_CHECK_LOCK:-~/.cache/nativejelly/check.lock}`, which is
deliberately OUTSIDE any git worktree so every checkout on the machine contends for the
same file. Set `NJ_CHECK_LOCK=off` to bypass locking entirely (escape hatch for a
machine known to be otherwise idle, or for debugging the wrapper itself).

While waiting, the current holder's identity (pid, worktree, start time) is printed
once immediately and then every 60 s, read out of the lock file's own contents: the
holder truncates and writes it (then fsyncs) right after acquiring, so a waiter never
prints stale information. With no `--timeout`, this blocks indefinitely; with one, it
exits 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) if the lock is still held when the timeout elapses.

Once acquired, CMD runs as a child in its own process group so that whatever it spawns
can be signaled as a unit; SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP are forwarded to that group, and the
wrapper exits with the child's exit status (128+signal if the child was signaled). The
lock fd is opened by THIS process only — Python file descriptors default to
non-inheritable (O_CLOEXEC), and nothing here changes that — so a stray daemon the
child leaves running cannot pin the lock after the wrapper exits.
