"""Seed a new lane's cargo target dir with an APFS clone of third-party build output.

A linked worktree ("lane") has its own cargo target dirs (`rust-modules/target`,
`target-release`, ...). Cold, each one recompiles every registry crate and the build-std
sysroot (std/core/alloc built from source) even though those artifacts are byte-for-byte what
the previous lane already built: cargo's metadata hash for a registry crate does not depend on
the path of the checkout. About 40% of a lane's target bytes (0.9 GB host, 0.44 GB ARM release) are exactly that.

    cargo-seed.py restore KIND TDIR     clone the seed into TDIR, only if TDIR does not exist
    cargo-seed.py harvest KIND TDIR     refresh the seed from TDIR, only if the seed is stale or
                                        lacks a top-level directory (`debug/`, `arm-.../`) TDIR has
    cargo-seed.py prune [--days N]      delete seeds unused for N days (`build-gc.sh --cache`)

What makes this safe, in order of importance:

* **The app crate is never in the seed.** Every entry whose name contains `nativejelly` (the
  package, the storage helper, their fingerprints, build-script output, test binaries and their
  `*.rcgu.o` objects) is deleted from the harvested copy, and so is `.lib-artifacts.json`. Cargo
  decides whether a PATH package needs rebuilding by mtime, and its metadata hash is the same in
  every lane, so a cloned app artifact newer than the lane's sources would be linked silently. A
  cloned third-party artifact, by contrast, is validated by cargo's own fingerprint and is at worst
  recompiled, so a wrong seed costs time and never bytes.
* **Restore only ever creates an ABSENT directory.** A lane that has a target dir keeps it; the
  clone is made next to its destination and renamed into place, so a failure never leaves a
  partial tree behind.
* **It clones or it does nothing.** `clonefile(2)` is called directly (not `cp -c`, which quietly
  falls back to a full copy, spending the very disk this exists to save). Another volume, a
  filesystem without cloning, or any platform other than macOS: a no-op, never a copy.
* **Linked worktrees only.** The main checkout keeps its own incremental cache and full DWARF,
  which no lane could share, so the Makefile does not call this there and the script refuses
  too. `NJ_CARGO_SEED=off` disables it everywhere.
* **A key guards the seed**: the sha256 of the toolchain (`rustc +nightly -vV` and `rustc -vV`),
  `Cargo.lock`, the manifests (minus the app's own `version =` line), and every cargo config that
  applies. A seed with a different key is not restored, and the next lane to finish a build
  replaces it.

The seed lives under `$NJ_BUILD_CACHE/cargo-seed/<kind>/` (default `~/.cache/nativejelly`) beside
the shared FFmpeg cache, and `tools/build-gc.sh --cache` (30 days) and `--seed` (7 days, also run by `--auto` under disk
pressure) prune it by age. `du` counts a clone's
bytes in full, so a lane that was seeded reads as big as one that was not: `df` is the truth.

Every failure here is non-fatal by design (exit 0 with one warning line); a build never waits on,
or fails because of, the seed.
