"""Run one ABR pipeline case on the DESKTOP SIMULATOR — no television, no lock, N at once.

    tools/abr-sim-case.py pipe_abr_down_outrun [seconds]
    tools/abr-sim-case.py --list

**Why this exists.** The television is a mutex and the ABR tier costs ~40 minutes of it, because
every `abr_shape` case forces `--no-early` (a commit COUNT is not monotone, so a case cannot stop
when its assertions are satisfied). Since 2026-08-28 `make sim` builds a HOST copy of the bundled
FFmpeg, so `ff.rs` demuxes here: everything between the socket and the decoder runs on the Mac —
both AVIO transports, the HLS demux, the AU queues and their byte-cap backpressure, the feed-ahead
throttle, `ff.rs`'s rung transactions, seek and PTS rebase. This arms a real case against a real
`serve_fixtures.py` and lets the controller drive it.

It reads the case out of `tests/manifest.json` rather than restating it, so the declaration, the
fixture and the request-indexed `segment_profile` are the SAME ones the device tier arms. That is
the whole point: a divergence between the two tiers should come from the tier, not from two
hand-written copies of a case drifting apart.

**What it CANNOT tell you**, and the reasons are structural rather than temporary:

* **Nothing decodes.** `nativejelly-clocksink` accepts access units, discards them, and advances a
  presentation clock at real time clamped to the last fed PTS. That is a faithful plant for the
  reserve the controller reads and it is not a decoder. Anything about LG's decoder — resource
  allocation, the Load payload's Dolby declaration, raster excursions, frame pacing — is
  device-only. `docs/webos10-resource-allocation.md` is what that blindness costs.
* **No number here is a device measurement.** Every heartbeat carries `sim=1` precisely so a
  pasted log cannot be mistaken for one, and this Mac's link to loopback is not a television's
  link to a PMS.
* **It does not grade.** It runs the case and prints where the log is; `tests/run.py` owns the
  assertions. Grading here would be a second copy of `a_abr_shape` free to disagree with the first.

**Traps, both cost time before they are known.** `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` fails with
`CreateWindow failed` — the simulator needs a real GL context, so a small `NJ_WIN` is used
instead of hiding the window. And `serve()` returns `(server, url_base)`, not a server.
