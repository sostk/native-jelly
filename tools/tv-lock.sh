#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. There is one dev set, one app instance on it, and nothing in webOS, ssh or
# this repo enforces one user at a time. Two `tests/run.py` runs, or a run plus a `make deploy`,
# or a capture session plus either, kill each other's app — and the damage is not a clean failure,
# it is PLAUSIBLE WRONG DATA: a bogus timeline_climb, an fps number measured while somebody else's
# binary was being deployed underneath, a capture of a screen the other job navigated away from.
# None of those can be told from a real regression by looking at them. Sequencing by hand is what
# was keeping jobs apart, and "at most one lane at a time" is a rule that is true when written and
# false the moment a second agent starts.
#
# WHERE THE LOCK LIVES: on the TELEVISION, at $REMOTE_LOCK — a directory, because `mkdir` is the
# one create-if-absent primitive that is atomic on every filesystem including this set's busybox
# userland. On the device rather than on a dev Mac because the television is the resource: a
# host-side file cannot see the second worktree, the second machine, or the colleague on the sofa,
# and this project's collisions come from exactly those. It is under /tmp deliberately — a TV
# reboot clears it, which is the one event that also makes every holder's session meaningless.
#
# The name does NOT begin with `nativejelly-`, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: for the
# stable install the app's runtime root IS /tmp, and any file there matching that prefix marks the
# boot as automated and suppresses the who's-watching picker (`dev::any_trigger_present`). A lock
# named `nativejelly-tv.lock` would silently change which screen the app boots to — for every
# session, including the ones it was taken to protect. It is also outside the `nativejelly-*` glob
# that `make run` and `tests/run.py` clear, so a teardown cannot drop somebody's lease.
#
# THE CLOCK IS THE HOST'S. Every timestamp written into the lock comes from the machine taking it,
# never from `date` on the TV: pmlog's wall clock on this set runs about three hours off, so a
# lease minted against it would expire in the past or three hours late. Hosts are NTP-synced to
# each other; the television is not synced to anything that matters here.
#
# See .agents/skills/tv-lock/SKILL.md for the workflow, and docs/agent-reference.md's testing section for what
# the lock does and does not protect (it cannot see a human watching a film with the remote).
