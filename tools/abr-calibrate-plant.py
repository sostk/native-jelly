"""Derive `rust-modules/src/abr/sim.rs`'s plant calibration from committed evidence.

**Why this is a tool and not a table somebody typed.** `sim.rs` is the closed-loop plant the ABR
controller is graded against, and it carried three hand-transcribed operating points. Two of the
three describe a fixture pack that no longer exists: the pack was rebuilt between the `p1` and `p1b`
capture runs, and at rung 720 the delivered rate moved 1381 -> 806 kbps (1.72x) while at rung 4000
it moved the other way. Nothing failed when that happened, because nothing recomputes the table. So
the table is now generated, its provenance is printed beside every number, and a stale one is a
`make check` failure rather than a silently wrong simulation.

**Two things are calibrated here and the second is the one that blocks the simulator.**

1. **Operating points** — `ts_kbps`, `audio_es_kbps`, `overhead_ms` plus the master declaration
   and decoded raster per rung, from the M4 pin
   census. `sim.rs` refuses to run an uncalibrated rung rather than interpolating, so a
   three-point table confines every closed-loop experiment to three rungs of a thirteen-rung ladder.

2. **Transaction legs** — up/down x commit/reject. Every one is an `Option` in `sim.rs` and `run()`
   REFUSES the moment it needs a missing one, so **an uncalibrated transaction model means the
   simulator cannot execute any trace that changes rung at all**. Three of the four are now
   measured across the committed corpus. The fourth, `down_reject`, has n = 0 and that is
   structural rather than an oversight: `Controller::candidate_ready` accepts every downshift that
   produced a decodable segment, so a down-reject needs a decode or raster failure to happen at
   all. It is reported as absent, never invented.

Sources, all already in the repository:

* `abr: sample current= media= net= buf= dur= prod=` in `docs/measurements/*-logs/pipe_abr_pin_*.log`
  — the delivered TS rate, the reserve, and (as `prod*dur - media*dur/net`) the non-transfer part of
  acquisition.
* `abr: tx <dir> ... outcome= control= warmup= graded=` in every captured log — the transaction legs.
* `ffprobe` on the local fixture pack — the audio elementary rate, which the logs do not carry.
