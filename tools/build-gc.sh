# Report and reclaim this repository's DERIVED build trees, across every worktree at once.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The build products of this project are large, per-checkout and unbounded, and
# the fleet workflow (`.agents/skills/fleet-plan`) multiplies them by the number of lanes. Nothing
# ever collected them, so the failure mode was not a warning — it was a volume at 99% with 3.2 GiB
# free, measured 2026-09-03 across twelve lanes plus the main checkout:
#
#   45 GB   the repo tree
#   24 GB   ⤷ `target*/debug/incremental` — a CACHE OF THE LAST BUILD, 1.2-4.0 GB per lane
#   14 GB   ⤷ `target*/debug/deps` and the cross-build outputs
#    2.6 GB ⤷ vendor/ffmpeg-build — twelve byte-identical copies of one 122 MB object tree
#
# ...and then a further **36 GB that none of those numbers could see**, because `fleet-plan` tells
# workers to point `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at `$HOME/plx-fleet/<lane>` — OUTSIDE the repository, so
# outside every `du` anyone had run. Ten lanes' worth, every one of them an ORPHAN whose worktree
# had long since been removed. That is what `--orphans` is for, and it is the mode to reach for
# first: nothing on the machine will ever refer to those trees again.
#
# Read that top-to-bottom before reaching for the thing everyone reaches for. **FFmpeg is 6% of
# it.** The compile cache is 53%. Two changes since address the standing halves — `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`
# in a linked worktree (the Makefile, beside `RUST_FEATFLAGS`) and a shared flag-keyed FFmpeg
# build tree (`ci/build-ffmpeg.sh`) — and this script is the third: the one that reclaims what is
# already on disk, and the one to run when a build starts failing for space.
#
# WHAT IS SAFE. Everything this script deletes is reproducible by `make` from tracked sources, and
# it never touches a file git knows about. It deletes only paths matching the derived-tree names
# below, and it will not touch the MAIN checkout's `target/` unless asked (that is the tree a human
# iterates in; a lane's is cut for one task).
set -eu

# BEFORE THE `cd`, because `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` resolves a relative NJ_BUILD_CACHE against the
# CALLER's directory and this script is about to change to the repository root. Left alone, the two
# would resolve `NJ_BUILD_CACHE=.plx-cache` to different places: the report would describe a cache
# that does not exist, the prune would target the wrong tree, and — worst of the three — the busy
# guard would look for active locks in a directory no build is using and cheerfully find none.

# THE INCREMENTAL POLICY, ENFORCED WHERE IT LEAKS.
#
# The Makefile sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` in a linked worktree, with a long comment explaining why
# a lane cut for one task must not pay a multi-gigabyte cache of its last build. That rule is
# correct and it does not hold, because it lives in ONE of the several places a `cargo` runs here:
# every agent (and `AGENTS.md`'s own `--no-default-features` gate) invokes cargo directly, and a
# direct invocation never reads the Makefile. Measured 2026-09-17 across this machine's 113
# worktrees: **12.9 GB of `target*/debug/incremental` inside LINKED worktrees**, on a volume with
# 5.1 GiB free — i.e. the policy's whole stated saving, still on the disk, in the checkouts it
# names.
#
# Cargo merges `.cargo/config.toml` upward from the working directory and the NEAREST setting
# wins, so a file at the worktrees ROOT applies to every lane under it and to nothing else — the
# main checkout sits above that directory and keeps its cache, which is exactly the Makefile's
# rule, now written where any cargo can see it. An explicit `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` still wins: an
# environment variable outranks a config file, so the documented escape hatch for a lane doing
# genuinely long iterative work is unchanged.
#
# Installed from here rather than committed because `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored — it is
# local scratch, and this is the one tool that already owns what lives in it. Idempotent, and
# never written if a human has put something else in that file.

incremental = false

# v2, 2026-09-18. The incremental cache reads 0 B in every lane now that the rule above actually
# holds — but a lane's `target/` did not shrink with it, because it was never the incremental
# cache doing most of the damage there. A measured lane's target dir was 4.0 GB, of which 3.1 GB
# was `debug/deps`, of which 1.5 GB was `*.rcgu.o` — one object file per codegen unit, left next
# to the test binary because this host's cargo defaults to `split-debuginfo=unpacked` rather than
# packing debuginfo into the binary or dropping it. The main checkout carries the identical shape
# at larger scale (4.1 GB of `.o` in a 5.5 GB `debug/`), which is precisely why this section does
# NOT apply there: a lane is cut for one task and its whole target dir is thrown away with the
# worktree (see `--worktrees` below), so it has no use for the debugger's-eye view those object
# files exist for — only the coarse line-table entry a panic backtrace needs. `line-tables-only`
# keeps that; `debug = false` on every third-party package drops the same bloat in code this
# repository does not own or step through anyway.
#
# Measured 2026-09-18 against this crate's own `--lib --no-run` test build (host target, two
# clean /tmp target dirs so nothing but the profile differed): full DWARF (`debug = 2`, cargo's
# own default) produced a 789 MB `debug/`, of which the root crate's 16 `*.rcgu.o` codegen units
# alone were 318 MB; this policy produced a 703 MB `debug/` with the same 16 files at 236 MB — an
# 11% cut to the whole tree and a 26% cut to the object files directly, from ONE crate's `--lib`
# closure. The saving is modest, plainly: most of the object-file bulk is code, not DWARF.
#
# `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=2` in the environment still overrides this, the same escape hatch as
# `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` above: an env var outranks a config file, so a lane genuinely attaching
# `lldb`/`rust-lldb` to a host test can buy full DWARF back for itself without touching this file.
#
# Checked before landing that nothing else in the nearer config chain already sets this and would
# make the addition a no-op or a conflict: neither `rust-modules/Cargo.toml` (only
# `[profile.release]`) nor `rust-modules/.cargo/config.toml` (only `[target...]` rustflags and
# `[unstable] build-std`) mentions `[profile.dev]` debug. Cargo resolves a manifest `[profile]`
# against a config `[profile]` by letting config win, and the nearest config wins over a farther
# one — both rules favour this file over anything upstream, which is the reason it is safe to add
# here rather than in the crate manifest.

usage: tools/build-gc.sh [MODE] [-n]

  (no mode)       report every checkout's derived trees, the shared cache and free space
  --incremental   delete `target*/debug/incremental` everywhere. Always safe: it is a compile
                  cache. A linked worktree is not supposed to write one (the one sanctioned
                  exception is the opt-in `make test-fast`, whose own `target-fast` this
                  reclaims like any other; its next run is a cold build) — but the Makefile's
                  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` only reaches the cargo runs `make` launches, and 12.9 GB
                  of them had accumulated past it by 2026-09-17, which is why this script now
                  installs the same rule as a `.cargo/config.toml` any cargo can see.
  --lanes         delete every derived tree in the LINKED WORKTREES — cargo target dirs and the
                  vendor build trees — plus the EXTERNAL lane target dirs under $NJ_FLEET_DIR
                  (default ~/plx-fleet), which is where fleet-plan tells workers to point
                  CARGO_TARGET_DIR and which outlive their worktree. The main checkout is left
                  alone. Costs each lane one rebuild when it next runs; costs no source,
                  committed or not.
  --orphans       delete ONLY the external lane target dirs whose worktree no longer exists.
                  The narrowest mode and the one to reach for first: nothing on this machine
                  will ever refer to those trees again, and no live lane pays a rebuild.
  --worktrees     remove FINISHED linked worktrees outright: working tree clean, not locked, not
                  the main checkout, not the checkout this script is running from, and its HEAD
                  is already on `main` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`, or a squash-merge check
                  via `git merge-tree --write-tree` against `main`'s tree — the check
                  `git branch --merged` cannot make, and the shape every lane here actually
                  lands as, per AGENTS.md's squash-only trunk rule). Removal is a plain
                  `git worktree remove` (no --force, so it refuses rather than eating anything
                  the clean-tree check missed) followed by that lane's external target dir under
                  $NJ_FLEET_DIR if one exists. Branches are never deleted; a removed worktree
                  whose branch still exists is reported as "branch left" so the owner decides.
                  Every worktree NOT removed is reported with one reason: dirty | locked |
                  unmerged | building | current | main.
  --stale         delete SUPERSEDED per-hash cargo artifacts from every `deps/` directory this
                  script can find — inside the lanes, inside the external $NJ_FLEET_DIR lane
                  target dirs, AND inside the MAIN checkout's own `rust-modules/target*` (the one
                  tree every other destructive mode leaves alone). Cargo keys each build by a
                  metadata hash that folds in the exact feature/flag/profile combination (lib
                  test, `--no-default-features` check, devtools/hostsim, ARM); a source edit
                  reuses the SAME hash's files, but a hash nothing builds anymore — yesterday's
                  feature set, a reverted flag — keeps its binary, `.d`, `.rlib`/`.rmeta` and every
                  `*.rcgu.o` codegen-unit object forever, because cargo has no notion of "nobody
                  asks for this anymore" and never sweeps it. In a lane or an external fleet
                  target dir: keeps the newest hash per (crate name, artifact kind — test binary
                  vs rlib vs other) plus any hash whose newest file is younger than
                  $NJ_GC_STALE_HOURS hours (default 24); deletes every other hash's files
                  outright. In the MAIN checkout: a separate, more conservative rule — a hash is
                  only ever deleted for being OLDER than the threshold, and the newest hash per
                  crate (regardless of kind) is never touched, because that tree is the one a
                  human iterates in and a second live hash there is often deliberate. Either way,
                  once a test-binary hash survives, its own `*.rcgu.o` objects are still declined
                  individually once they age past the threshold — only a line-table backtrace
                  needs the binary; the objects exist solely for a debugger attached to it.
                  Respects the same in-use guard as every other mode: a `deps/` dir a live build
                  is writing into is skipped, never swept.
  --cache         delete shared FFmpeg build trees under $NJ_BUILD_CACHE untouched for
                  $NJ_CACHE_MAX_DAYS days (default 30). They are keyed by configure flags AND
                  toolchain, so a version bump or an NDK upgrade strands the old entry silently —
                  a cache nothing prunes is the same unbounded growth this script exists for.
                  The tarball is kept; it is 11 MB and every checkout copies from it. The same
                  threshold prunes the cargo seed (`tools/cargo-seed.py`) that fresh lanes are
                  cloned from, by the last time a lane restored from or refreshed it; a lane
                  built from it is unaffected (a clone owns its blocks), and the next lane to
                  finish a build makes a new one.
  --seed          delete the cargo seed (`tools/cargo-seed.py`) that fresh lanes are cloned from
                  when no lane has restored from or refreshed it for $NJ_SEED_MAX_DAYS days
                  (default 7). Once the lanes it was cloned from are gone its ~1.3 GB belongs
                  to it alone, and this is the stage `--auto` runs for it under disk pressure
                  (`--cache` waits for 30 days and never runs from `--auto`). The next lane to
                  finish a build makes a new one; lanes already seeded are unaffected.
  --all           --incremental everywhere plus --lanes, --stale, --orphans and --cache, and the
                  main checkout's vendor build trees. Leaves the main checkout's target dirs
                  themselves in place — `--stale` only removes the superseded hashes inside them.
  --auto          staged reclaim, driven by free space on this volume, and the mode a hook or
                  launchd job runs unattended — see `tools/install-disk-watch.sh`. Always runs
                  --orphans first (cheap, safe, unconditional). Below $NJ_GC_MIN_FREE_GIB GiB
                  free (default 20): --incremental, then --worktrees, then --lanes restricted to
                  lanes idle for at least $NJ_GC_IDLE_MIN minutes (default 60, judged by the
                  newest mtime anywhere under the worktree, target dirs included) — a lane an
                  agent might resume in the next few minutes is not the same as one nobody is
                  touching, and a needless rebuild costs real money — then --stale, which is
                  the one stage allowed to touch the MAIN checkout (age-gated only there, per
                  --stale's own conservative rule; never the newest hash per crate). Never
                  --cache, never a tracked file, never any main-checkout file --stale itself
                  would not also remove standalone; finally --seed (the cargo seed, once no lane has
                  used it for a week; under pressure only). Single-instance: a mkdir lock
                  (stale-safe, $NJ_GC_LOCK_DIR) means a second --auto exits 0 quietly rather than
                  racing the first. Logs one line per stage to $NJ_GC_LOG (default
                  ~/Library/Logs/nativejelly-build-gc.log on macOS,
                  ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.cache}/nativejelly/build-gc.log elsewhere), truncated to its
                  last ~200 lines past ~1 MB. `--auto -n` previews every stage the current free
                  space would trigger, deletes nothing, and still takes the lock.
  -n, --dry-run   print what would go, delete nothing.

Nothing here touches a tracked file or the television. The only thing it removes from the shared
cache under $NJ_BUILD_CACHE is what `--cache` finds unused for $NJ_CACHE_MAX_DAYS days (FFmpeg
trees and the cargo seed); `--auto` never runs `--cache`, only `--seed` (the seed, after
$NJ_SEED_MAX_DAYS days). Everything it removes is rebuilt by `make`.

# Has anything under this lane's worktree — sources, staged files, the target dirs beneath it —
# been touched in the last $2 minutes? Used only to SPARE a lane from `--lanes` under `--auto`
# pressure, never to decide whether a build is running (that is `in_live_checkout`, which this
# does not replace). Deliberately a recursive `find -mmin`, not the directory's own mtime: a
# target dir's top-level entry does not move while a compiler writes beneath it — see
# `live_checkouts`' note on the identical trap — so the only honest answer is a walk. Piped into
# `head -1` so a single recent hit short-circuits the walk instead of statting a multi-gigabyte
# tree just to answer yes/no; `.git` is excluded because `git worktree remove` and routine git
# housekeeping touch it without the lane itself being active.
#
# `-mmin -0` is handled BEFORE ever calling `find`, not left for it to answer: "less than zero
# minutes old" ought to match nothing, and it did in isolated testing — but under real load
# (`ci/test_build_gc.py` measured this failing roughly every other run of its own idle-guard test,
# every failure showing `find` matching every file in the tree it should have matched none of) the
# exact zero boundary is not reliable across the (`stat`, `find`'s own clock read, filesystem mtime
# resolution) chain this walks. `$NJ_GC_IDLE_MIN=0` has an honest meaning anyway — "no idle guard,
# a lane is always eligible" — so answering it without `find` at all removes the flaky boundary

# --- `--stale`: superseded per-hash cargo artifacts -------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every mode above deletes a whole CACHE (`--incremental`) or a whole TREE
# (`--lanes`, `--worktrees`); none of them look inside a live `target*/<profile>/deps` directory,
# because everything in there is nominally "still needed" — cargo put it there for a reason and
# will read some of it on the next build. What cargo does NOT do is ever forget a reason once it
# stops applying: each distinct feature/flag/profile combination (a plain `--lib` test build, the
# `--no-default-features` check gate, devtools/hostsim, the ARM cross build) gets its own metadata
# hash, a source edit only touches the files under the CURRENT hash, and a hash nothing builds
# anymore — yesterday's feature set, a reverted flag — keeps its binary and every `*.rcgu.o`
# codegen-unit object beside it forever. Measured 2026-09-28 in the main checkout:
# `rust-modules/target/debug/deps` held 6416 `nativejelly_modules-*` files across 6 live-SIZED
# hashes (~100 MB binary + objects each), all last written 2026-09-17 — 5.5 GB nothing had built
# from in eleven days.
#
# THE UNIT OF DECISION IS THE METADATA HASH, NOT THE FILE. Every artifact cargo writes for one
# compilation shares the same `<crate>-<hash>` prefix: the test/check binary itself
# (`<crate>-<hash>`, executable, no extension), its dep-info (`<crate>-<hash>.d`), the rlib side
# (`lib<crate>-<hash>.rlib`/`.rmeta`/`.a`/`.so`/`.dylib`), and — with this host's default
# `split-debuginfo=unpacked` — one `<crate>-<hash>.<codegen-hash>-cgu.NN.rcgu.o` per codegen unit,
# which is where nearly all the bulk lives (250-2300 files per hash, measured). Keeping or
# deleting anything less than the whole hash-group at once produces a `.d` file with no binary or
# an `.rlib` with half its objects gone — not smaller, just broken.

# THE SWEEP ITSELF, one `deps/` directory at a time. `$2` is the grouping scope: `kind` (lanes and

# vs other) — the aggressive rule, appropriate for a tree that is rebuilt on demand anyway. `crate`
# (the main checkout only) keeps the newest hash per crate name ALONE, never mind kind, which is
# the more conservative floor: a human iterates in this tree and a second live hash there — a
# `--no-default-features` check run beside the ordinary one — is often deliberate. Both scopes
# additionally keep any hash whose newest file is younger than $NJ_GC_STALE_HOURS hours, and both
# still decline a KEPT test-binary hash's individual `*.rcgu.o` objects once those age past the
# threshold: only a line-table backtrace needs the binary; the objects exist solely for a debugger
# attached to it, and nothing here attaches one to a superseded-in-spirit-but-still-newest binary.
#
# Two passes, both in one awk program fed `mtime\tsize\texec\tpath` lines (so nothing here builds
# an associative array by hand in `/bin/sh`, which cannot): accumulate every file under its

# lines (one per file to remove) or a `SUM\t<label>\t<count>\t<bytes>` line just before the DEL
# lines for that hash, so the shell loop below can print one report line per hash-group instead of

# WHAT COUNTS AS "A BUILD IS RUNNING" IS WIDER THAN CARGO. Most of a `make` here is not cargo at
# all — FFmpeg's own configure and make, the Sentry Native CMake build, the C translation units,
# the final link — and during every one of those phases neither `cargo` nor `rustc` exists as a
# process. A guard that watched only those two would pass happily and delete the very tree the
# build was reading, which is not a clean failure: it is a half-removed object tree and a build
# that fails somewhere unrelated. So the list covers the cross compiler and `make` as well, and
# the authoritative signal for the shared FFmpeg tree is its own LOCK — if one is held by a live
# process, somebody is inside `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` right now.
#
# A dry run deletes nothing, so it is exempt — and it has to be, because "is a build running?" is
# precisely the question you are asking when you reach for `-n` in the middle of a fleet.
# `pgrep -x` matches the process NAME exactly. Deliberately not `pgrep -f`, which matches whole
# command lines and would find this script's own invocation the moment anything on it mentioned
# cargo — the self-match trap that has already made a finished job here read as still running.
# THE SAME LIVENESS RULE AS THE BUILDER, both halves of it. This checked only the pid, while
# `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` also checks the recorded PROCESS GROUP — so a build shell killed while its
# `configure` or `make` child kept writing looked dead to the prune and alive to every other
# builder, and `--cache` would take the lock and delete the tree out from under a live compiler.
# Two implementations of one rule is how that happens; this is now the same test, written once.
#
# And `kill -0 0` does not mean "dead": POSIX reads pid 0 as the caller's process group, so it
# SUCCEEDS. With the old `|| echo 0` fallback a lock with no pid file read as permanently alive.
# Define this before the global preflight invokes build_is_running, not just before prune_lock.

# WHICH CHECKOUTS A BUILD IS LIVE IN — the per-checkout half of the liveness question
# `build_is_running` above answers globally.
#
# That global guard is right about one thing and wrong about another. It is right that a delete
# under a live `cargo` produces a CORRUPT tree rather than an absent one. It is wrong that the only
# safe response is to refuse EVERYTHING: on this machine several sessions run `make check` in
# different worktrees at once, so `pgrep -x make` essentially never comes back empty — and a
# reclaim tool that cannot run while anybody is building is one that cannot run on the day the
# volume fills, which is the only day it is reached for. Measured 2026-09-17: 5.0 GiB free, 34.8
# GiB of derived trees in IDLE lanes, and this script refusing to touch a byte of it because two
# unrelated lanes happened to be compiling.
#
# A builder's WORKING DIRECTORY names the checkout it is building in, so the question is
# answerable per checkout rather than per machine: collect every builder's cwd, map each back to
# the worktree CONTAINING it (a `cargo` run from `<lane>/rust-modules` must protect `<lane>`), and
# skip only those. Everything else is collected as before.
#
# Deliberately NOT an mtime test, which is the obvious wrong answer and was the first thing tried:
# a target directory's own mtime does not move while a compiler writes into `debug/deps` beneath
# it, so the tree being written to RIGHT NOW is precisely the one that reads as untouched for half
# an hour.
#
# It FAILS CLOSED ON IGNORANCE, and only on ignorance. If `lsof` is missing, or a builder is
# running and its cwd cannot be READ, this returns non-zero and the global refusal below stands
# unchanged — the same answer this script has always given, now reached only when the cheaper and
# more precise one is unavailable.
#
# A cwd that is read successfully and belongs to no checkout of this repository is a different
# thing, and is deliberately NOT a refusal: it is somebody's unrelated `cargo` in an unrelated
# project, and treating that as a reason to delete nothing here is precisely the all-or-nothing
# behaviour this function exists to replace — one Rust project open elsewhere on the machine would
# veto the whole reclaim. The case that looks like it and is not — a builder in a lane git has
# stopped listing, whose EXTERNAL target dir under $FLEET_DIR would otherwise be collected as an
# orphan — is answered by the second rule in `in_live_checkout`, not by refusing.
#
# Written with temp files rather than `$(…)` around the `case`, and that is not style: **bash 3.2
# — what macOS ships, and what `#!/bin/sh` resolves to here — cannot parse a `case` inside a
# command substitution at all.** It scans for the closing paren without parsing, so the `)` ending
# a case pattern terminates the substitution and the `;;` after it is a syntax error.
