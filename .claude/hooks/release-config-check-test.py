"""Cases for the release-config hook's pure halves. `python3 .claude/hooks/release-config-check-test.py`.

HOST-ONLY, AND IT MUST STAY THAT WAY: it never invokes cargo, never writes to `target/`, and never
takes the build-directory lock. That is not a stylistic preference — this test is the thing that
runs while five agents are editing in parallel worktrees, and a test that shelled out to cargo
would queue behind whichever lane is building. The hook is therefore split so that everything
decided BEFORE the 0.55 s subprocess, and everything done with its output after, is pure:
`rust_src_target` (does this payload deserve a check), `verdict` (is that exit code a broken build
or an unusable toolchain), `target_dir` (where cargo builds), `first_error` (which line to quote
when it could not run), `trim` (what reaches the model), `nightly` (which toolchain),
`timeout_secs` (the cap).

WHAT THIS FILE STRUCTURALLY CANNOT GRADE, and so must be done by hand after any change to
`run_check`, `report` or `main`: that the hook actually reaches exit 2 on a real break. Splice a
release-only failure into a file under `rust-modules/src` — an item spliced between a
`#[cfg(feature = "devtriggers")]` attribute and its `fn`, which orphans the gate exactly as
2026-08-21 did, or a bare `#[cfg(not(feature = "devtriggers"))] compile_error!(...)` — feed the
hook an Edit payload for that file, confirm exit 2 with real compiler text on stderr, and revert.
Both were run on 2026-08-23; the second is also what exposed the `text=True` decode fail-open now
fixed in `run_check`, because its message carried an em-dash.

The interesting cases are the NEGATIVES. A missed edit costs one unchecked release configuration
and the next edit re-runs it; a false fire costs 0.55 s on every `.rs` write in the session and
teaches the reader to reach for `NJ_RELEASE_CHECK_SKIP`. The three that are easy to get wrong are
`src/bin/sim.rs` (a real Rust file under the tree, which `--lib` does not compile and the release
set could not build anyway — `required-features = ["hostsim"]`), `build.rs` (cargo compiles the script in
EVERY configuration, so a break in it is already covered by `make check` — true even though it now
emits `NJ_VERSION` for every build rather than early-returning outside `hostsim`), and a file in a sibling `.claude/worktrees/`
checkout (another lane's crate, another lane's target dir).

`/repo` below is a fabricated root: `rust_src_target` is pure path arithmetic, so nothing needs to
exist on disk. The one case that reads the real tree is `nightly()`, deliberately — it parses the
actual Makefile, so renaming `RUST_NIGHTLY` fails here instead of silently falling back.
