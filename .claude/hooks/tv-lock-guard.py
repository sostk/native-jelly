"""PreToolUse guard: no command may drive the television without holding its lock.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT JUST A CONVENTION. Every TV-facing tool in this repo now takes the lock
(`make deploy`, `tests/run.py`, `tools/tv-session.sh`, `tools/capture-screen.sh`), so the only way
left to collide is to go around them — a raw `ssh root@<tv> luna-send …`, an `scp` into the app
directory, a `sshpass` one-liner out of a memory or a doc. Those are exactly what an agent reaches
for when a tool refuses, and the damage from two lanes on one set is not a clean failure: it is
plausible WRONG data (an fps number measured while somebody else's binary was landing, a capture
of a screen the other job navigated away from). Nothing downstream can tell that from a real
regression, so it has to be stopped at the point of the command.

WHAT IT COSTS. Nothing on an unrelated command: the classifier is pure string work over the
command line, and the lease check is a single small file read, with no ssh and no network. The
television is never contacted from here.

LANE IDENTITY has to agree with `tools/tv-lock.sh`'s, and `payload["cwd"]` cannot supply it by
itself: the harness reports the SESSION's own checkout as `cwd` for every subagent's Bash call,
whatever worktree that agent actually runs in. `lane_from_command()` below is what a subagent
uses instead — an explicit `NJ_TV_LOCK_LANE=<its worktree>` prefixed on the command, so several
subagents can each hold their own lease and the lock still arbitrates between them rather than
collapsing onto one lane. See that function's docstring for the full resolution order.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT BLOCK.
  * read-only diagnostics that cannot disturb a running session: `tools/crash-report.sh`,
    `tv-session.sh log|status`, `make -s print-*`;
  * the lock tool itself and `wake-tv.sh` — waking a set is harmless and is how you get to a
    television you are about to lock;
  * every host-only path, which is most of this repo: `make check`, `make sim`, cargo, the
    simulator. When this hook refuses something, the simulator (`ui-sim` skill) is usually the
    right next move rather than waiting.

THE ESCAPE HATCH is a prefix on the command itself — `NJ_TV_LOCK_BYPASS=1 ssh root@…`. It is for
a human who knows the set is theirs (and for breaking a genuinely wedged lock); an agent reaching
for it is an agent working around a lock rather than waiting for one.

FAIL-OPEN ON ITS OWN BUGS, fail-closed on the answer: a crash in this file must not wedge every
Bash call in the session, but "no lease" is a refusal.  Contract: exit 0 allows, exit 2 blocks and
feeds stderr back to the model.
