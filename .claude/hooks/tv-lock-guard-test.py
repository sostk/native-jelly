"""Cases for the TV-lock guard's classifier. `python3 .claude/hooks/tv-lock-guard-test.py`.

Host-only, no television and no lock state involved: it imports the guard and asks it to classify
command lines. The pairs below are the ones that matter, and half of them are FALSE POSITIVES —
the guard's real failure mode is not missing an `ssh root@`, it is refusing `pgrep -fl
"…|make deploy"`, which is the pre-flight that asks whether anybody is on the set. Both of the
quoting cases here fired for real in the first two minutes the hook was live.

Addresses below are RFC 5737 documentation ranges, never this household's: the TV's real address
lives in the gitignored `.tv-host` and nowhere in the tree (docs/distribution.md §"private data").
The guard keys on `root@`, not on any particular host, so a placeholder tests it exactly.
