"""PreToolUse guard: nothing carrying this repo's private values may be published.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A CONVENTION. The convention already exists, in writing, and it already failed.
`docs/shared-servers.md` opens with "none of that data is ours" and a table of stand-ins — and its
own next paragraph records that the rule "stood here, in these words, while the repo published the
friend's handle, their machine name, their library name, their real port and their LAN address
across ~139 sites in committed code and four PR bodies (2026-08-14)". Those four (PRs #28-31) were
a batch of subagents told to write device-verification recipes "executable without me"; each did
the obviously helpful thing and pasted the real credentials block in. All four were redacted, but
GitHub keeps PR-body edit history, so those values are permanently public. The data was the
friend's, not the maintainer's, and they were not a party to any of it.

That is the shape this guards: not malice and not carelessness, but an agent being helpful with a
value it can read. A memory file is not in the loop at the moment a PR body is composed; a
PreToolUse hook is. github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native is PUBLIC.

WHAT IT COSTS. Classification is pure string work over the command line, and nothing is opened —
not the gitignored files, not even the repo root — unless a segment is first graded outbound, so
the 99% of Bash calls that are `cargo check`, `grep`, `make -s print-*` do no I/O here at all. That
last clause was not free: `main` used to resolve the repo root before asking whether anything was
outbound, which forked a `git rev-parse` on every Bash call in the session and cost 30 ms of it.
`grade()` is split out of `verdict` so the question can be asked without one. Re-measured on the
dev Mac 2026-08-23, median of 15: **23 ms** for a command that is not outbound, **31 ms** for one
that is, **46 ms** when a shape hit forces the `git grep` described below. Bare `python3 -c pass`
is 13 ms on this machine, so most of the floor is interpreter start-up and none of it is ours to
remove. No network, and the television is never contacted from here.

WHAT IT BLOCKS, AND WHY THAT LIST. Exactly the commands whose text lands somewhere this repo's
author cannot take it back from — somebody else's server, or the permanent history of a public
repository:
  * `gh pr create|edit|comment|review`, `gh issue create|edit|comment`, `gh release create|edit`,
    and ANY `gh` invocation carrying `--body`/`--body-file`/`-b`/`--notes`/`--notes-file`;
  * `gh release upload`, where the payload is a FILE rather than text — the .ipk is fine and is
    the normal case, `pkg/auth.json` is the shape to stop, and the path check below is what
    separates them;
  * `gh api` with a body flag (`-f`/`-F`/`--field`/`--raw-field`/`--input`) or a non-GET method.
    Bare `gh api … --jq` is a READ and stays allowed — `ci/verify-published.sh` and
    `docs/release-audits/README.md` are built on it, as are `gh release view|download` and
    `gh pr view`. `--json body` is a read too: this matches the FLAG `--body`, never the word.
  * `git commit` with `-m`/`-F`/`--message`/`--file` (short clusters like `-am` included),
    `git tag -m/-F`, `git notes … -m/-F`;
  * `curl`/`wget` carrying a request body or a query string — but see the destination gate below;
  * any of the above naming one of the gitignored private files as an ARGUMENT, plus `git add -f`
    on one (plain `git add` of an ignored path already fails on git's own refusal, so `-f` is the
    only reachable spelling) — but never as the value of a flag that carries TEXT. `gh pr create
    --body ".tv-host"` publishes eight characters, and refusing it would refuse the exact advice
    this hook's own refusal message ends on: name the file, do not paste the value. Verification
    found that false positive on 2026-08-23; `TEXT_FLAGS` is the fix and is scoped per command,
    because `-f` is a string field on `gh` and a boolean on `git add` whose next word is the path.
  * a private file read by a `$( )` or a backtick INSIDE an outbound payload — `--body "tv is
    $(cat .tv-host)"` names the file, reads it and publishes the contents on one visible line.
    Also found on 2026-08-23, and also previously allowed: the substitution's own segment is a
    `cat`, which is not outbound, and the outer token is quoted prose, which the path check skips.

WHY `git push` IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE GATE. By push time the message is already an object in the
local history and the interesting half of the leak has happened; `git commit` is where the text is
composed and is therefore where a refusal can still be acted on. Push is also the ordinary end of
every task and is reachable a dozen other ways (`gh pr create` pushes, so does any IDE), so gating
it would buy nothing and would teach the reader to reach for the bypass on a command they run all
day. The one thing push-time gating would add — catching a secret in the FILE CONTENTS of a commit
— this hook cannot do at any point, and `.gitignore` is that gate (see WHAT IT CANNOT SEE).

HEREDOC BODIES ARE SCANNED — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF `tv-lock-guard.py`, ON PURPOSE. That hook strips
heredoc bodies before classifying, because there a body is data being written and reading it turns
`cat > SKILL.md <<'EOF'` … `make deploy` … `EOF` into a refused deploy. Here the body IS the
payload: `gh pr create --body-file - <<'EOF' … EOF` is the normal way a PR body of any length is
passed, and a guard that strips it would scan the word `--body-file` and nothing else. So this file
does both, at different stages — bodies are stripped for CLASSIFICATION (a `gh pr create` quoted
inside a doc being written is not a publish) and kept for SCANNING, attached to the segment that
opened them so a heredoc on one line cannot condemn a `gh` command on the next. Named
`--body-file`/`--notes-file`/`-F`/`--input`/`-T`/`-d @file` paths are read and scanned the same way.

`git commit` WITH NO MESSAGE FLAG IS NOT SCANNED, and `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` is deliberately left
alone. At PreToolUse time that file still holds the PREVIOUS commit's message — git rewrites it
when it opens the editor, which is after this hook has already answered — so scanning it grades
text that was committed hours ago and produces a refusal about a message the author cannot even
see. The flagless form is also not the shape that leaks from an agent: a non-interactive Bash tool
has no editor, so `git commit` with no `-m` hangs or fails rather than committing. `--amend
--no-edit` reuses a message this hook saw when it was first written.

WHAT IT MATCHES. Two halves, and they fail in opposite directions on purpose.

(a) LITERAL VALUES, read at the moment the hook runs out of the gitignored files that hold them —
    `.tv-host` (the dev television's address), `.tv-mac` (its Wake-on-LAN MAC), `src/config.local.h`
    (`PMS_HOST`/`PMS_TOKEN`, the real Plex owner token), `tests/manifest.local.json` (PMS host, the
    test user's plex.tv id, this library's ratingKeys, and the shared_server block when there is
    one), `pkg/auth.json` (the persisted session: `account_token` and each source's per-server
    token), plus three more that `.gitignore` names and its comments explain — `local.env` ("real
    PMS host + X-Plex-Token"), `.tv-dpad-pass` (a generated password; "NEVER commit a password")
    and `.tv-remote-url` ("never commit a URL that is live while it is live"). Missing files are
    skipped, so a checkout with none of them simply has less to match. An exact substring hit on a
    real secret is never a false positive, which makes this the precise half.

    THE FLOOR IS 8 CHARACTERS, and values containing whitespace are skipped. Both are earned by the
    actual contents. Under 8 the files hold only things that are already public or that identify
    nothing: the port (`32400`, in every doc), a cosmetic display name (the template calls it
    "display name, cosmetic"), and the `items` ratingKeys — which are 1 to 4 digits and which
    CLAUDE.md prints in its own prose ("`rk=4` is shared by five cases, `rk=1804` by three"). A
    guard that matched those would refuse any commit message with a standalone 4 in it, starting with
    that sentence of CLAUDE.md's. The whitespace
    rule drops the templates' `_comment` prose, which is verbatim public in the tracked
    `.example` files; keys beginning `_` are skipped for the same reason. Nothing that is actually
    dialable falls under the floor — the shortest RFC1918 address is `10.0.0.1`, exactly 8 — and
    the shape rules below backstop it anyway. Matching is case-insensitive because a MAC and a
    40-hex id get rewritten in either case constantly.

(b) SHAPE PATTERNS, for values a checkout might not hold but that still must not go out:
    `X-Plex-Token=`/`plexToken=` with a real-looking value, a 20-character mixed-case-and-digit
    alnum run inside a URL (the shape of a Plex token), a 40-hex id in a machineIdentifier context,
    and a private-range IPv4 (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16). This half is the imprecise one, so its
    three sharpest edges are filed down deliberately:

    * A 40-HEX RUN IS ONLY MATCHED IN CONTEXT (`machineIdentifier=`, `machine_id:`,
      `clientIdentifier=`, `X-Plex-Client-Identifier`). A git sha1 is also 40 hex, and this repo's
      release audits are full of them — `docs/release-audits/README.md` greps hashes and shas out
      of published bodies and artifacts as a matter of routine. A guard that refuses `git commit -m "revert
      <40-hex>"` is a guard that gets switched off.
    * A URL TOKEN MUST CARRY A DIGIT, A LOWERCASE AND AN UPPERCASE. An all-lowercase 20-char run in
      a URL is far more likely to be a path segment than a token. This trades a possible miss (the
      literal half covers the token that actually exists here) for not refusing ordinary links.
    * A PRIVATE QUAD THAT A TRACKED FILE ALREADY CONTAINS IS NOT A LEAK, so shape hits on the
      IPv4 and 40-hex rules are dropped when `git grep -F` finds the value in a tracked file. This
      is not a loophole, it is the whole point: `docs/shared-servers.md`'s stand-in table nominates
      `10.9.9.7` as the LAN-address placeholder — RFC1918 on purpose, "as the real one is", and it
      is now in five tracked files including `plex/account.rs` and `plex/probe.rs` — and
      `docs/plex-openapi.json` carries `10.0.0.42` eight times as upstream Plex's own example.
      Without this rule the guard refuses the very placeholder the docs tell you to use. It is
      applied to those two shape rules and NOT to the literal half or the token rules: a real
      credential sitting in a tracked file is an incident to clean up, never a licence to republish.

    THE DESTINATION GATE ON curl/wget IS LOAD-BEARING. `curl "http://<pms>:32400/library/sections?
    X-Plex-Token=<real token>"` is the single most common debugging command in this repo, and it
    contains two real secrets by necessity — but it sends them to the machine they belong to. So a
    curl or wget whose URLs are all loopback, RFC1918, a dotless host, one under `.local`/`.lan`/
    `.home`/`.internal`, or one under `plex.tv` (where a Plex token legitimately goes — that is how
    `tests/run.py` resolves the test user's per-server token) is not outbound at all.
    Anything aimed off the LAN is.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MATCH, beyond the floor: RFC 5737 documentation addresses
(`192.0.2.x`, `198.51.100.x`, `203.0.113.x`) — this repo uses them as placeholders on purpose, and
so does `tv-lock-guard-test.py`; `1.2.3.4`, which is the Makefile's own example; `127.0.0.1`,
`0.0.0.0` and `localhost`; a partial range like `192.168.x` or `172.20.x.x` (naming a range is not
naming a host, it is not dialable, and the manifest template does it); a quad written as CIDR
(`172.16.0.0/12`); `<placeholder>` and `YOUR_*` forms, so nothing in
`tests/manifest.local.json.example` or `src/config.local.h.example` can ever trip it; and `alpine`,
the webosbrew dev-mode root password, which CLAUDE.md and `docs/distribution.md` both keep on
purpose because it is published, identical on every rooted set, and identifies nobody.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody reads a pass as proof:
  * FILE CONTENTS in a commit. This grades command TEXT, not the diff — `git add -A && git commit
    -m "wip"` with a secret inside a newly tracked file is `.gitignore`'s job, not this hook's.
  * A SHELL VARIABLE. `--body "$BODY"` and `X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN` expand after the hook has answered;
    refusing an unexpanded `$VAR` would be a false positive on every scripted call, so it does not.
    Its close relative IS caught, and the difference is worth stating: a `$( )` or backtick that
    NAMES a gitignored file is visible text and is refused (above), while `TV=$(cat .tv-host)` on
    one line and `--body "$TV"` on the next is not — the value crosses through a variable and this
    hook sees only one command line at a time.
  * A SCRIPT THAT PUBLISHES INTERNALLY. Only the top-level command line is visible, so
    `ci/verify-published.sh` is one word here whatever `gh` it runs — the same structural limit
    `tv-lock-guard.py` has.
  * AN EDITOR SESSION, per the COMMIT_EDITMSG note above. This is a scanner, not a permission
    system: it refuses commands whose visible payload contains a private value, and it does not try
    to have an opinion about publishing as such.

IT NEVER PRINTS THE MATCHED VALUE. The refusal names which secret and which file it came from, and
stops there — writing the value into the transcript is the same leak by a shorter route. For the
same reason the refusal does not advertise the bypass: the next step after this message is a
placeholder, not a way past it.

That sentence stood here while it was FALSE, which is the worst way for a claim like it to be
wrong — a reader has no reason to re-check a guard's own promise. The refusal echoes the offending
command back so the author can see what was refused, and until 2026-08-23 it echoed the value with
it: `git commit -m "server at <the TV's address>"` came back verbatim, address included. Found by
driving the real binary against a throwaway root of fake secrets and grepping its stderr for them,
which is the only way to check this and is now a step in the test. `redact()` is the fix; the
heredoc body and any `--body-file` contents were never echoed and still are not.

THE ESCAPE HATCH is a prefix on the command itself — `NJ_PUBLISH_BYPASS=1 gh pr create …`. It is
for a human publishing something the scanner mis-read (a doc that must quote a real-looking address
is the realistic case). An agent reaching for it is deciding, on the maintainer's behalf and
usually on a third party's behalf, to publish an address that cannot be un-published. Use a
stand-in from `docs/shared-servers.md`'s table instead, or ask.

FAIL-OPEN ON ITS OWN BUGS, fail-closed on the answer: a crash in this file must not wedge every
Bash call in the session, but a match is a refusal. Contract: exit 0 allows, exit 2 blocks and
feeds stderr back to the model.

    command verbatim, address included. The docstring above already promised the opposite, which
    is the worst version of this — a claim the reader has no reason to re-check. Found by driving
    the real binary against a throwaway root of fake secrets and grepping the stderr for them.

    Echoing the command line back is not the same leak as printing a file's contents (the command
    was in the transcript before this hook ran; a `--body-file`'s contents were not), but it is a
    leak by any route where hook stderr outlives the tool call, and the fix is four lines. The
    heredoc body and the payload file are never echoed at all.

    Deliberately does NOT apply the suppressions `findings` applies — no `published()`, no
    `mixed_run`, no DOC_NET. Over-redacting costs the reader a placeholder they can still see in
    their own command; under-redacting costs the thing this function exists for. Redaction runs
