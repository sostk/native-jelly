"""PostToolUse: type-check the RELEASE feature set after a Rust edit — the one configuration
nothing else in this project compiles until a release cut.

THE GAP, MEASURED. `rust-modules/Cargo.toml` declares `default = ["devtools", "devtriggers"]`, and
`make RELEASE=1` drops both (`RUST_FEATFLAGS = $(if $(RELEASE),--no-default-features,)`, Makefile
line 304). Everything that routinely compiles this crate builds the DEFAULT set: `make check`
(`cargo +$(RUST_NIGHTLY) test --lib`, line 666), `make lint` (line 699), the plain cross-build
(line 438), and `make sim` (line 875 — `--features hostsim` ON TOP of the defaults, not instead of
them). So does CI's pull-request gate — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make check` (line 50),
then the plain cross-build (line 98), then `make ipk FLAVOR=debug` (line 108), and never drops a
feature. The release job is the only CI job that does, and it turns the flag on through an **`env:`
block** — `RELEASE: "1"`, `release.yml` line 236 — so a grep for the literal `RELEASE=1` does not
find the build at all: `grep -rnE 'no-default-features|RELEASE=1' .github/` returns exactly two
hits, `release.yml` lines 252-253, and both are the ASSERTION that the flag took effect, fired
after `make ipk` has already run. Exactly one other command in the tree drops both features —
`make macapp` (`ci/mkmacapp.py` line 84: `--release --no-default-features --features hostsim`) —
and it is neither routine nor the same configuration: it is run to mail somebody a Mac bundle, and
it puts `hostsim` back on top, which swaps `player::ffi`'s whole seam.

Measured on this tree, 2026-08-23: **27** `cfg(feature = "devtriggers")` sites and **7**
`cfg(feature = "devtools")` sites in `rust-modules/src` — every one of them a place where the
shipping build compiles different text from the tested build, first COMPILED during a release cut.
**24 of those 27 have a `cfg(not(feature = "devtriggers"))` twin**, i.e. are one half of a
hand-written PAIR — which is not a footnote, it is the exact shape that broke (below), and the
count of live instances of it. Re-count both with (no backslashes on purpose — this is a
docstring, and Python 3.12 turns an invalid escape into a SyntaxWarning printed on every edit):

    grep -rho 'cfg(feature = "[a-z]*"' rust-modules/src --include='*.rs' | sort | uniq -c
    grep -rho 'cfg(not(feature = "[a-z]*"' rust-modules/src --include='*.rs' | sort | uniq -c

And `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings = "deny"` makes the gap sharper, not softer: an import that only the
`devtriggers` arm consumed does not warn in the release configuration, it FAILS it.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A CONVENTION. Because the convention exists, is written down, and did not fire.
The project memory note `release-config-not-covered-by-check` records the shape and one instance:
on 2026-08-21 a new `#[cfg(feature = "devtriggers")]`-gated function inserted BETWEEN an existing
pair's attribute and its `fn` orphaned that attribute onto the new function's doc comment.
`density_max_sweep`'s devtriggers arm lost its gate and collided with its own `#[cfg(not(...))]`
twin — `error[E0428]: defined multiple times`, only under `--no-default-features`, with 786/786
tests green and every other target clean throughout. That break is invisible from inside the
editing session: nothing you can run reproduces it unless you already suspect it, which is the
definition of a check that should not be a habit.

WHAT IT COSTS. Measured on the dev Mac, 2026-08-23, warm target dir, after `touch`ing one source
file: **0.52 / 0.54 / 0.60 s** over three trials for `cargo +nightly check --lib
--no-default-features`, and **0.52 s** for the same command with the default set — call it 0.55 s
for either. An edit to anything else costs **0.02 s**, the whole hook, measured both ways: a
non-`.rs` path is rejected on the extension before even the `git rev-parse`, and a `.rs` outside
this crate's `src/` is rejected on pure path arithmetic after it. Cargo is never started for
either. A second run of the DEFAULT set happens only when the release set already failed — see the message below, which needs to know
whether the break is release-specific or shared, and cannot know from one run. Both runs share ONE
budget (`NJ_RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, default 90 s) rather than one each, because a cap that can be
doubled is not a cap. The harness applies its OWN per-hook timeout on top and the smaller of the
two wins, so wire this in `.claude/settings.json` with a `timeout` at least as large as the cap
(`"timeout": 120` beside the default 90) or the 90 is decorative. Being killed that way is benign —
a dead hook is a missed check, exactly like the lock-wait path — but it is not what the number
says, and `tv-lock-guard.py` is wired at `timeout: 15`, which would truncate this one hard.

WHERE IT BUILDS: **ONE shared directory under `$TMPDIR`**, not the crate's own `target/` and not a
private per-lane one. Two separate arguments land on the same answer.

*Shared, not per-lane.* Cargo keys unit fingerprints by feature set AND by package id (which for a
path package carries its absolute manifest path), so both configurations and every lane coexist in
one directory without evicting each other. Measured by alternating the two configurations with no
edit in between, 2026-08-23: after each has run once, EVERY subsequent run of either reports
`Finished … in 0.03s`. That is the whole reason the number above is 0.55 s and not a rebuild. A
private target dir was measured the same day — **12.99 s** to populate cold and **339 MB** on disk,
per worktree — and disk is not a theoretical cost here: agents run in parallel
`.claude/worktrees/` checkouts (`git worktree list` showed three beside this one on 2026-08-23),
and this project has already had a disk fill from per-worktree builds (memory
`worktree-fleet-hazards`). The price of sharing is the build-directory LOCK, handled below.

*`$TMPDIR`, not `rust-modules/target/`.* This checkout can live on a filesystem cargo cannot build
in. Measured 2026-08-25 with the repo on a **network mount** (`mount` reporting `smbfs`): every edit
failed the hook with `error: incremental compilation: could not create session directory lock file:
Operation not supported (os error 45)` followed by `error: could not compile nativejelly-modules
(build script)` — i.e. a **false RELEASE-CONFIG BREAK on a tree that compiles perfectly**, on every
`.rs` write, reported against whatever the author had just touched. A network mount also costs the
wall clock this hook's whole budget is measured in: the same host suite that runs in 15 s of CPU
took 1:17 through the mount, cold. `$TMPDIR` is local by construction on macOS (a per-user
`/var/folders/…/T`), so the lock works and the bytes are fast.
Two consequences to know: it is **cleared on reboot**, so the first edit after a restart pays the
cold 13 s rather than 0.55 s; and it is no longer the directory `make check` populates, so the two
no longer warm each other (the shared-dir measurement above still holds — between this hook's own
two configurations, and between lanes). An explicit `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` in the environment WINS, so
a caller who wants the old behaviour points it at `rust-modules/target` — and `verdict` now files
this whole class (an unlockable or full build directory) as 'unusable' rather than 'broken', so a
filesystem the hook cannot build in never again reads as the author's bug.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK.
  * **The default feature set.** `make check`, `make lint`, CI and the `rust-analyzer-lsp` plugin
    enabled in `.claude/settings.json` all cover it, the last of them live in the editor. This
    hook is for the configuration with no other reader. (A break in the default set usually shows
    up here anyway, since almost all of the crate is shared text — so when it does, the message
    says so rather than blaming the release configuration for a plain compile error.)
  * **`hostsim`.** A third configuration, off by default, built only by `make sim`, and it ships to
    nobody. It has the same structural exposure and a much smaller blast radius.
  * **`rust-modules/src/bin/sim.rs`** and anything else under `src/bin/`: `--lib` does not compile
    them, and `required-features = ["hostsim"]` means the release configuration never does either.
    Firing there would spend the 0.55 s and grade nothing.
  * **`rust-modules/build.rs`.** Cargo compiles the script in every configuration, so a break in
    it is a break `make check` already sees. Note what that does and does not cover now: since it
    started publishing `NJ_VERSION` it no longer emits nothing outside `hostsim` — `emit_version`
    runs first, in every configuration, and BRANCHES on `NJ_RELEASE`. Both arms compile whatever
    is being checked (it is a runtime branch in a host binary, not a `cfg`), which is why this
    still skips; what nothing here executes is the release arm's VALUE, and nothing should try to
    — `ci/check-package.py` grades the version the packaged bytes actually carry, at package time,
    from both sides.
  * **`rust-modules/Cargo.toml`**, where the feature list itself lives. Firing there would cost the
    same 0.6 s (measured — a manifest touch invalidates no more than a source touch does), so cost
    is not the reason; scope is. This hook grades a Rust edit's SIDE EFFECT on a configuration the
    author was not thinking about. Someone editing `[features]` is thinking about exactly that, and
    a one-line change here would extend it if that stops being true.
  * **`#[cfg(test)]` code**, which `cargo check --lib` does not compile. If a release-only break
    ever hides in a test module, this will not be what finds it.
  * **A file in ANOTHER lane's worktree.** The crate checked is the one under the repo root
    resolved from this call's `cwd` (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so a worktree is its own
    lane, exactly as `tv-lock-guard.py` does it). An edit reaching sideways into
    `.claude/worktrees/<other>/rust-modules/src/` is not checked here: running cargo in another
    lane's target dir is the per-worktree build cost this hook just argued against, and that lane
    will check the file on its own next edit.

THE BUILD-DIRECTORY LOCK IS A WAIT, NOT A FAILURE. Cargo takes an exclusive lock on `target/`, so a
concurrent `make check` in this lane makes this call BLOCK ("Blocking waiting for file lock on
build directory") rather than fail. On timeout the hook prints a note and exits 0. Reporting a lock
wait as a broken build would be a lie that costs the model a debugging detour, and the next edit
re-runs the check anyway.

WHICH NIGHTLY. The same one the Makefile uses — `RUST_NIGHTLY` is parsed out of the Makefile
(`?= nightly`, line 175; CI pins a date), and a `RUST_NIGHTLY` in the environment wins, matching
make's `?=`. The toolchain is not incidental: CLAUDE.md records `task.rs`'s refused-spawn test
passing 284/284 on stable while panicking inside `std` on nightly, and `-Z build-std` means
nightly is what ships. If that toolchain is not installed the check is SKIPPED, not failed —
and `RUSTUP_AUTO_INSTALL=0` is set for the subprocess so rustup refuses instead of quietly starting
a several-hundred-MB download behind an ordinary Edit. Measured 2026-08-23 on rustup 1.29.0, with a
name that does not exist: **0.24 s** of network ("info: syncing channel updates for …") before
giving up, versus **0.01-0.02 s** refusing outright with the variable set. The quarter-second is
not the point and should not be quoted as the cost — it is what a MISS costs; a toolchain name
that really exists is where the hundreds of megabytes are, and there is no timing to measure
because nobody would sit through it. A `RUSTFLAGS` already in the environment is inherited rather
than cleared, so `Cargo.toml`'s documented `RUSTFLAGS="--cap-lints=warn"` mid-edit escape keeps
working through this hook too.

THE ESCAPE HATCH is `NJ_RELEASE_CHECK_SKIP=1` in the environment (and
`NJ_RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` to move the cap, default 90). Unlike the TV lock's bypass it
is NOT a command prefix, and that asymmetry is deliberate: this hook fires on Edit/Write, which
carry no command line for an agent to decorate, so the hatch is reachable only by the human who
started the session — `export NJ_RELEASE_CHECK_SKIP=1`, or an `env` entry in
`.claude/settings.json`. It is for a human deliberately holding the release arm broken across a
long refactor. There is no reason for it during a release cut; that is when the check is the point.

FAIL-OPEN ON ITS OWN BUGS, and fail-open on cargo's too. A crash here must not wedge every edit in
the session, and neither must a missing toolchain, a missing cargo, or a lock wait — only real
compiler diagnostics reach exit 2. Contract: exit 0 = silent pass, exit 2 = stderr is fed back to
the model as a problem to fix, anything else is a hook error shown to the user.

The cost of that generosity is that a bug in this file reads as a PASS, so the one place it must
not be casual is decoding cargo's output — see `run_check`, where `text=True`'s locale default was
a real fail-open (found 2026-08-23, by feeding the hook a release-only `compile_error!` whose
message carried an em-dash). The general rule, which this project files under
`[[silent-instrument-trap]]`: before trusting the silence, prove the instrument can see the thing.
`python3 .claude/hooks/release-config-check-test.py` grades the pure halves; the half it cannot
reach is deliberately proven by hand — splice a release-only break into a file under
`rust-modules/src`, confirm exit 2 with real compiler text, and revert.
