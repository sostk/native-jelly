"""Cases for the outbound guard's classifier. `python3 .claude/hooks/outbound-guard-test.py`.

Host-only: no network, no `gh`, no git remote, and — the part that matters — NO REAL SECRET. The
guard reads its values out of the gitignored files at run time, so the seam it was given for this
is `load_secrets(root)`: the test builds a throwaway directory holding a FAKE `.tv-host`,
`.tv-mac`, `src/config.local.h` and `tests/manifest.local.json`, loads those, and drives
`verdict(..., secrets=…, published=…)` against them. A tracked test file that contained the real
Plex token in order to prove the token is caught would be the leak it is testing for.

Half the cases below are FALSE POSITIVES, for the same reason `tv-lock-guard-test.py` says: the
failure that gets a guard switched off is not the missed leak, it is refusing
`git commit -m "document the 203.0.113.5 placeholder"`. The specific ones that would fire without
the carve-outs in the guard's docstring are marked where they sit — RFC 5737 addresses, a git sha1
that is also 40 hex, a private quad this repo publishes on purpose, and the one debugging command
that legitimately carries both the real PMS address and the real token.

The fake values here are fabricated: `192.168.44.x` is not this household's network, and the fake
token is keyboard noise of the right shape (20 alnum, mixed case and digits).
