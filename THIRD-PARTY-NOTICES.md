# Third-party notices

This file accompanies the **Native Jelly** application package (`com.sostk.nativejelly`), an unofficial
native Jellyfin client for LG webOS 4.x televisions. Native Jelly is a fork of PlxNative
(Copyright (c) 2026 Gleb Linnik) and is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE`; the
brand reservation and the non-affiliation statements are in `TRADEMARKS.md`, alongside it in both
the repository and this package).

The file is organised by **relationship**. Both the applicable license and the actual
relationship affect obligations; dynamic linking is not a blanket exemption:

1. **Redistributed in this package** — third-party code or assets that are physically inside the
   files you received (compiled into the `nativejelly` binary, embedded in it, or shipped beside
   it). These carry real attribution obligations, discharged here and in `licenses/`.
2. **Dynamically linked, not redistributed** — libraries that already exist on your television
   and are loaded at run time by SONAME. No copy of them is contained in this package.
3. **Not determined** — components we could not establish a licence for, listed as unknown
   rather than guessed.

Full licence texts are **not** repeated inline. They are in the `licenses/` directory of this
package; the exact required contents of that directory are listed in section 5.

## 1. LGPL-2.1 components and your right to modify and replace them

Two different situations, and the difference matters for what we owe you.

### 1.1 FFmpeg — **redistributed inside this package**

PlxNative **ships its own build of FFmpeg**. Earlier releases linked against the television's copy;
they no longer do, because the TV's version moves with the firmware (libavformat 55, 57, 58, 59 and
60 across webOS 2 to 11) and the components compiled into it cannot be determined from outside.

| Shipped file | Upstream | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `libavutil-plx.so.61`, `libavcodec-plx.so.63`, `libavformat-plx.so.63` | FFmpeg **9.0**, unmodified | LGPL-2.1-or-later |

**These libraries are covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later.** A
complete copy of that licence is supplied with this package at `licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt`.

**Complete corresponding source.** The exact upstream tarball these were built from —
`ffmpeg-9.0.tar.xz`, sha256 `7f607a00dd0d28a729d5a4811205812eef01cf6ef6155025febb6f36a9062d52`,
from <https://ffmpeg.org/releases/> — is attached to every PlxNative release alongside the `.ipk`.
The sources are **unmodified**: no patches are applied. The complete configure invocation that
produced them, including every enabled component, is `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` in the PlxNative
repository, which is also attached to each release.

**Configuration.** Built with `--disable-everything` plus an explicit component list, **without**
`--enable-gpl`, `--enable-version3` or `--enable-nonfree`, so no GPL-licensed or non-free FFmpeg
component is present. Only demuxers, parsers, bitstream filters and *subtitle* decoders are
enabled — video and audio are decoded by the television's hardware, not by FFmpeg. The one
external library enabled is **zlib**, the television's own `libz.so.1` (not redistributed — see
section 3), which the Matroska demuxer needs to inflate compressed subtitle tracks.

**You may modify and replace them.** They are ordinary shared libraries, loaded at run time by
`dlopen` from the application's own directory; no FFmpeg code is linked into the `nativejelly`
executable. Build your own from the source above and put it in the app directory under the same
file name, and PlxNative will load yours instead, with no change to the application. The `-plx`
suffix in the file names exists so these cannot be confused with — or accidentally replace — the
television's own FFmpeg; it denotes nothing about their content, which is stock upstream.

One disclosure, so the claim is not overstated: the application reads FFmpeg struct fields at
byte offsets fixed for the ABI of the versions above, and refuses to demux at all if the library
it loads reports different majors. A replacement built from the same upstream release works; one
built from a different release will be declined rather than misread.

### 1.2 Native ASS rendering — redistributed inside this package

`libass-plx.so.0` contains the PlxNative facade and this pinned, statically linked stack.
The macOS simulator uses the same sources in `libass-plx.0.dylib`; the Linux simulator
uses `libass-plx-host.so.0`.

| Component | Version | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| libass | 0.17.5 | ISC (`licenses/libass-ISC.txt`) |
| FreeType | 2.14.3 | Elected FreeType License; contributed MIT and Zlib code (`licenses/FreeType.txt`, `licenses/Zlib.txt`) |
| FriBidi | 1.0.17 | LGPL-2.1-or-later (`licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt`) |
| HarfBuzz | 14.5.0 | Old MIT (`licenses/HarfBuzz-Old-MIT.txt`) |

Portions of this software are copyright © 2026 The FreeType Project
(https://freetype.org). All rights reserved. Its built-in gzip reader contains
zlib 1.3.1, Copyright (C) 1995-2024 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. FriBidi is
Copyright (C) 1999, 2000, 2017-2019 Dov Grobgeld; 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 Behdad Esfahbod;
2004 Sharif FarsiWeb, Inc.; and other contributors;
the complete per-file notices accompany its source. libass and HarfBuzz copyright
notices are retained in their licence files above.

The exact upstream archives, checksums and licences are recorded in
`ci/libass-dependencies.json`. Each versioned PlxNative source release contains all
four archives, the facade (`src/ass.c`, `include/ass.h`), and its complete build
recipe (`ci/build-libass.sh`, `ci/build-libass.py`). Upstream sources are unmodified.
The library is built without system font providers or external font-library
dependencies. FreeType's optional external compression/image libraries are disabled;
HarfBuzz uses FreeType and its built-in Unicode data, without ICU or platform shapers.

You may modify and rebuild the complete library, including FriBidi, using the
matching source release, then replace `libass-plx.so.0` in the app directory. The
application loads that file by absolute path and checks the PlxNative facade ABI.
This distribution supplies source for the entire combined library, including the
GPL-3.0-or-later facade, so recipients can rebuild and relink it. No library in this
stack is taken from, or installed into, the television's firmware.

### 1.3 Libraries provided by your television

PlxNative also links dynamically against the following libraries (glibc/GLib are
**LGPL-2.1-or-later**; libcurl is **curl** licensed), which are
part of your television's own system software and are **not** distributed by us:

| Library | Version on this webOS 4.5 build | SONAME(s) the app requests |
|---|---|---|
| GLib | 2.48.2 | `libglib-2.0.so.0` |
| GNU C Library (glibc) | 2.24 | `libc.so.6`, `libm.so.6`, `libpthread.so.0`, `librt.so.1`, `libdl.so.2`, `ld-linux.so.3` |
| libcurl | 7.x | `libcurl.so.4` or `libcurl.so.5` (whichever the firmware provides) |

libcurl uses the curl license, not LGPL; its distinct grant is listed in section 3.
For these libraries, PlxNative uses the ordinary shared-library mechanism (LGPL-2.1 §6(b)): no code from
them is copied into the executable, and the dynamic loader resolves them at run time against the
television's own `/usr/lib`. To use your own build, install an interface-compatible library under
the same SONAME. The GPL-3.0-or-later terms under which PlxNative is distributed permit modification of the
application for your own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

One further disclosure: small fragments of glibc's own startup and compatibility code **are**
statically linked into `nativejelly` by the toolchain (`crt1.o` and objects from `libc_nonshared.a`
— this is why the binary defines `_start`, `__libc_csu_init`, `__libc_csu_fini`, `fstat64`,
`lstat64`, `fstatat64`). They are covered by the same LGPL-2.1 notice and licence copy above.
Whether those particular files additionally carry glibc's linking exception was **not verified**
for the NDK build used here.

## 2. Redistributed in this package

### 2.1 Vendored C source, compiled into `nativejelly`

**nanosvg** and **nanosvgrast** — Copyright (c) 2013-14 Mikko Mononen <memon@inside.org>
Licence: **Zlib** (`licenses/Zlib.txt`). The vendored headers are byte-identical to upstream
(github.com/memononen/nanosvg); they are not altered.
The upstream headers credit, and we reproduce, the following derivations:

- The SVG parser is based on **Anti-Grain Geometry 2.4** SVG example — Copyright (C) 2002-2004
  Maxim Shemanarev (McSeem).
- Arc calculation code is from **canvg** (https://code.google.com/p/canvg/).
- Bounding-box calculation is based on the method described at blog.hackers-cafe.net.
- The polygon rasterizer is heavily based on the **stb_truetype** rasterizer by Sean Barrett
  (http://nothings.org/).

### 2.2 Icon artwork embedded in `nativejelly`

The following SVG icons are compiled into the binary. All are visually modified from upstream
(stroke width and/or colour); modifications are stated where the licence requires it.

**Google Material Design Icons** — the `person` icon (`assets/icons/user.svg`)
Copyright Google LLC. Licence: **Apache License 2.0** (`licenses/Apache-2.0.txt`).
*Modified*: the transparent bounding-box path was removed and an explicit white fill added.
The upstream repository contains no `NOTICE` file, so no NOTICE content is propagated.

**Feather Icons** — the `delete` icon (`assets/icons/backspace.svg`)
Copyright (c) 2013-2023 Cole Bemis. Licence: **MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`).
*Modified*: stroke width 2 → 2.2, stroke colour set to white.
The three chevron icons (`chevron.svg`, `chevron-down.svg`, `chevron-up.svg`) use the same vertex
coordinates as Feather's `chevron-right` / `chevron-down` / `chevron-up`, re-expressed as paths
at stroke width 3. Whether that constitutes derivation or independent authorship of trivial
geometry was **not established**; they are credited here out of caution under the same notice.

**Heroicons** — the `check` icon (`assets/icons/check.svg`)
Copyright (c) Tailwind Labs, Inc. Licence: **MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`).
The path data `M5 13l4 4L19 7` on a 24×24 grid is identical to Heroicons v1
`optimized/outline/check.svg` (confirmed against upstream). *Modified*: stroke width 2 → 3,
stroke colour set to white.

The remaining icons in the application are original work by the PlxNative author. See section 4
for a trademark note that applies to some of them.

### 2.3 Fonts

**Inter** — `appfont.ttf`, `appfont-bold.ttf`
Copyright 2016 The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter), per the fonts' own
name table; the licence file shipped with this package states "Copyright 2020". Version
4.001 (git-66647c0bb).
Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1** — the full text ships in this package as `OFL.txt`.
*Modified*: these are static instances cut from the Inter variable font at weight 400 / 700 and
optical size 18, with tabular figures frozen and a legacy `kern` table synthesised. Inter's
copyright statement declares **no Reserved Font Name**, so OFL §3 imposes no rename and the
family name "Inter" is retained. The fonts also carry the upstream trademark statement
"Inter UI and Inter is a trademark of rsms."

**Noto Sans CJK KR** — `appfont-cjk.ttf`
Copyright © 2014-2021 Adobe (https://www.adobe.com/), per the font's own name table. Version
2.004, from `github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk` release `Sans2.004`, asset
`Sans/Variable/TTF/NotoSansCJKkr-VF.ttf`.
Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1** — the same text that ships in this package as `OFL.txt`.
The licence body distributed with Noto CJK and the one distributed with Inter are identical; only
their copyright headers differ, and both copyright statements are reproduced here and inside each
font's own name table (IDs 0, 7, 13 and 14).
*Modified*: this is a static instance cut from the variable font at weight 400, with the `GSUB`,
`GPOS`, `GDEF`, `BASE`, `DSIG`, `vhea` and `vmtx` tables removed — all of them unreadable by
SDL2_ttf 2.0.x, which performs no shaping and no vertical layout. **No codepoint was removed**:
all 44810 ship. The recipe is `tools/cut-noto-cjk.py`, which pins the input by sha256.
The Reserved Font Name declared by this font's copyright statement is **"Source"** (Noto Sans CJK
derives from Adobe's Source Han Sans), which this package does not use, so OFL §3 imposes no
rename and the family name "Noto Sans CJK KR" is retained. The font also carries the upstream
trademark statement "Source is a trademark of Adobe in the United States and/or other countries."

*Why it ships:* it is the second link of the application's font fallback chain. Inter covers no
Hangul, Kana or Han, so without this face every Korean, Japanese and Chinese title in a Plex
library renders as empty boxes. See `rust-modules/gfx/src/text.rs` for the chain and
`rust-modules/src/fontcov.rs` for the coverage each face is required to have.

### 2.4 Rust code statically linked into `nativejelly`

The application core is Rust. The Rust standard library is compiled from source
(`-Z build-std`) and linked in, together with the crates below. All of this code is
redistributed in the binary. Where a package offers a choice of licences, our election is
stated; election does not alter your rights under the other arms.

`calendrical_calculations` implements algorithms from *Calendrical Calculations* by Reingold &
Dershowitz, Cambridge University Press, 4th edition (2018), released as Lisp code under
Apache-2.0. Its package licence carries the Unicode Consortium copyright reproduced above;
its source retains the upstream algorithm attribution. It ships no separate `NOTICE` file.
`core_maths` also identifies Rust standard-library method signatures, implementations and
documentation as its source; the Rust notices above apply to that material.

The registry `libm` package is an ICU4X dependency in addition to the compiler's vendored math
implementation. `licenses/libm.txt` preserves its complete upstream licence and musl/CORE-MATH
attributions. `qrcodegen` supplies the QR code linking viewers to the translation contribution
guide; its source-header licence notice is preserved verbatim in `licenses/qrcodegen.txt`.

The versions above come from the locked ARM runtime dependency graph (`cargo tree
--no-default-features --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi --edges normal,no-proc-macro`), excluding
dev dependencies, build dependencies and host proc-macro implementations.

**Conjunctive licence — no election possible:**

**compiler_builtins 0.1.160**, declared `MIT AND Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception AND (MIT OR
Apache-2.0)`. Both `licenses/MIT.txt` and `licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` together with
`licenses/LLVM-exception.txt` apply. It contains code derived from **LLVM's compiler-rt**
(https://llvm.org/): work derived from compiler-rt prior to 2019-01-19 is used under the MIT
licence with the copyright "Copyright (c) 2009-2016 by the contributors listed in CREDITS.TXT"
(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/compiler-rt/CREDITS.TXT); work derived after
that date is used under Apache-2.0 with the LLVM exception. The LLVM exception waives Apache-2.0
§4(a), (b) and (d) for portions embedded into object form by compilation; it waives nothing in
MIT, so the MIT notice above is required and is given.

**Unicode Character Database tables in Rust `core`**
(`library/core/src/unicode`, statically linked; reached by character classification and case
mapping): Copyright © 1991-2024 Unicode, Inc. Licence: **UNICODE LICENSE V3**
(`licenses/Unicode-3.0.txt`). That licence permits this notice to appear in associated
documentation, which is what this file is.

**Independent JPEG Group acknowledgement.** The `image` crate contains a Rust translation of
`jfdctint.c` from the Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg version 9a
(`src/codecs/jpeg/transform.rs`), reached through the JPEG encoder used by the application's
capture module, which is compiled into every configuration of the binary. As required by IJG
condition (2) for distribution of executable code:

> This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

IJG code is copyright (C) 1991-2014, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.

**Not in the binary, listed to prevent a false conclusion.** `serde_derive`, `proc-macro2`,
`quote`, `syn`, `unicode-ident`, `autocfg`, `synstructure`, `yoke-derive`,
`zerofrom-derive` and `zerovec-derive` are host build-time machinery and contribute no
code to the shipped binary. `foldhash` appears in the Rust source tree but is **not** compiled
here (the standard library takes `hashbrown` with default features disabled, which does not
enable it) — verified absent from the binary. `rustc-literal-escaper`, `proc_macro`,
`panic_abort` are build-std source components; final object inclusion is recorded in the linker evidence. `std_detect` supplies CPU capability detection in the Rust runtime and is covered by the Rust notices above.

### 2.5 Compiler runtime fragments statically linked into `nativejelly`

- **GCC runtime startup objects** (`crtbegin.o`, `crtend.o`) from the webOS NDK's GCC 12.2.0.
  Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later **WITH GCC-exception-3.1**. The GCC Runtime Library Exception
  permits distributing eligible compilation output under the application terms; the exception
  text is supplied as `licenses/GCC-exception-3.1.txt`. Like the glibc startup objects, these are
  part of the NDK's compiler and C runtime (webosbrew native-toolchain) and are System Libraries
  under GPL section 1.
- **PlxNative auxv compatibility seam** (`src/compat/getauxval.c`), GPL-3.0-or-later. It supplies a bounded immutable process snapshot for the Rust runtime. Project-local linker guards exclude the old NDK `libglibc_polyfills.a` from every newly built ELF.

### 2.6 Native crash capture

**Sentry Native 0.16.6** — Copyright (c) 2019 Sentry and individual contributors. Licence:
**MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`). Its client library is statically linked into `nativejelly`; the
out-of-process `sentry-crash` handler is shipped beside it. The handler is built with its HTTP
transport disabled: it writes a crash envelope for PlxNative's consent-aware sender to deliver on
the next launch. The source is patched for webOS's glibc 2.12 syscall surface and the 32-bit ARM
APCS frame layout; the pinned source hash and complete patch are in `ci/build-sentry-native.sh` and
`vendor/sentry-native/webos-arm32.patch`.

**libunwind** (the copy vendored by Sentry Native) — Copyright (c) 2002 Hewlett-Packard Co.
Licence: **MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`). It is statically linked into both the client and crash
handler and is used to initialise the ARM unwind machinery outside signal context.

## 3. Dynamically linked, not redistributed

The libraries below are part of your television's software. This package contains no copy of
them; PlxNative loads them at run time. Their upstream terms and the applicable GPL linking basis must be assessed separately; absence
of a bundled copy alone does not establish that no obligation applies.

## 4. Not determined, and matters outside licensing

**Licence not established.** The following are used but we could not determine a licence, and we
decline to guess one:

- `libGLESv2.so.2` — the television's OpenGL ES 2.0 implementation (an LG shim over the ARM Mali
  driver). Proprietary; no published licence located.
- `libAcbAPI.so.1`, `libplayerAPIs.so.1` (StarfishMediaAPIs), `libpf-1.0.so.1` — LG proprietary
  media components of webOS. No published licence located. PlxNative uses locally declared
  interoperability interfaces; the owner has closed the review of their provenance and GPL/platform
  basis, treating them as GPL-3.0 section 1 System Libraries never redistributed with the
  application.
**Historical NDK archive:** pre-migration builds included `libglibc_polyfills.a`, whose licence was not established. It is excluded from new linker inputs. This does not grant permission for previously distributed copies.

**Non-affiliation.** PlxNative is an independent, unofficial application. It is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LG Electronics, Plex GmbH, Fandango Media (Rotten Tomatoes),
IMDb.com, or The Movie Database. "webOS", "LG", "Plex", "Rotten Tomatoes", "IMDb", "TMDB" and all
other trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Where those names appear in the
application, they identify whose review score is being shown and nothing more.

**Third-party brands in the interface (not a licence matter).** Review scores fetched from the
user's own Plex Media Server are labelled with the name of the service that published them, set
as ordinary text. No third-party logo, wordmark or brand colour is reproduced: the only glyphs
beside a score are two original drawings — a tomato and a group of people — that indicate the
verdict, not the vendor. Nothing here is owed under any licence in this file.

*This paragraph previously described a set of shipped icons depicting the Rotten Tomatoes fruit
and popcorn marks, and IMDb/TMDB rendered as name-and-brand-colour chips. Those eleven assets were
removed in favour of the above; the notice is kept accurate rather than deleted, because a stale
disclosure that over-states what a package contains is its own problem.*

## 5. The `licenses/` directory

This package must contain the following licence texts, verbatim, plus the project and
runtime notices listed below:

| File | Required by |
|---|---|
| `licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt` | FFmpeg, FriBidi, GLib, GNU C Library (§1) — GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 |
| `licenses/MIT.txt` | Feather Icons, Heroicons, the MIT-elected Rust packages, Sentry Native and libunwind (§2.2, §2.4, §2.6). One copy of the MIT text; the copyright holders it refers to are the ones named in this file |
| `licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` | Google Material Design Icons; calendrical_calculations; moxcms; pxfm; compiler_builtins (§2.2, §2.4) |
| `licenses/LLVM-exception.txt` | compiler_builtins (§2.4) |
| `licenses/Unicode-3.0.txt` | Unicode Character Database tables in Rust `core` (§2.4) — UNICODE LICENSE V3, "Copyright © 1991-2024 Unicode, Inc." |
| `licenses/ICU4X.txt` | ICU4X runtime code and compiled locale data, including its Unicode and IBM notices (§2.4) |
| `licenses/libm.txt` | Registry libm and its upstream musl/CORE-MATH attributions (§2.4) |
| `licenses/qrcodegen.txt` | Project Nayuki QR code generator, complete upstream MIT notice (§2.4) |
| `licenses/Zlib.txt` | nanosvg (§2.1), FreeType's built-in gzip reader (§1.2) |
| `licenses/libass-ISC.txt` | libass (§1.2), including its copyright notice |
| `licenses/FreeType.txt` | FreeType's elected FTL and contributed module notices (§1.2) |
| `licenses/HarfBuzz-Old-MIT.txt` | HarfBuzz and its copyright holders (§1.2) |

`OFL.txt` (SIL Open Font License 1.1, for **Inter and Noto Sans CJK KR** — §2.3) already ships at
the root of this package. Keep it there; do not add a second copy under `licenses/`, and do not
add a second copy for the second font: the two upstream licence bodies are byte-identical, and
what differs between them (the copyright statement and the Reserved Font Name) is reproduced in
§2.3 and carried inside each font's own name table.

No BSD-3-Clause text is required because Apache-2.0 is elected for `moxcms` and `pxfm`. The full GPLv3 text is supplied at the package root as `LICENSE`; `LICENSING.md` states
the GPL-3.0-or-later election. Also retain `licenses/GCC-exception-3.1.txt` and
`licenses/PlxNative-historical-MIT.txt`.

## 6. Deliberately not listed

Two third-party components exist in the PlxNative source repository but are **not** part of this
package, and therefore carry no obligation discharged here: **libjpeg-turbo**
(`libturbojpeg.so.0`, copied to developer televisions by the development deploy step only) and
**jsmpeg** (a host-side development tool). Neither is present in the installed application.

## Source-only attribution

The historical polyfill entry describes the pre-migration build and does not license it. Every
ELF that ships in the package is checked for its exact linker inputs by `ci/check-link-evidence.py`
and `ci/check-packaged-elf.py`, which is what proves the old archive is absent from new builds.

**Frank Muller** contributed the server connection port fix in commit
`11b867a34b54dda5a9c6b99127b9dffdf90a23fd` (`plex/origin.rs`, `plex/probe.rs`) under the
then-current MIT grant. That original grant and Gleb Linnik notice are preserved in
`licenses/PlxNative-historical-MIT.txt`; no ownership transfer is claimed.

Source bundles also contain SDL2 Zlib headers, embedded Mesa/Khronos MIT and SGI-B-2.0
header blocks, Khronos GLES2 MIT/Apache-2.0 headers, and the MIT-licensed jsmpeg tool
(Copyright (c) 2017 Dominic Szablewski). Preserve their original embedded notices. Exact per-file
license assignments are in the inventory; the SGI text is in `licenses/SGI-B-2.0.txt`; none of `include/` is claimed as original LG ABI work.
